2923,Out of the Park Baseball 12,8.0,2,"Moneyball and a calculus textbook combined, but hardball diehards can't help but love the deeply satisfying mix of peanuts, Cracker Jacks, and sabermetrics.        First off, though, you might need to start playing Out of the Park Baseball 12 by making an adjustment to how the game launches. The game was initially so broken as to be unplayable, due to a blizzard of errors whenever simming a day or even saving. The fix, at least in our experience, involves simply clicking on the game executable and then selecting the ""Run as administrator"" option. It isn't clear how widespread this problem might be, but it's severe enough that it can make it tough to get through a single day of MLB action, let alone a full season.     Once you get the game up and running, you find a similar OOTP to that released in 2009 and 2010. This is major league baseball in a box, a hardball universe that lets you join the ballclub of your choice and then manage it for as many seasons as you like. You make the call on just about everything by serving as the bench boss and the GM. Many tasks can be automated, but generally, you set rosters, draw up batting orders, establish pitching rotations, make bullpen assignments, send out trade offers, wheel and deal with free agents, place players on the disabled list, and so forth. The game focuses on the real major leagues, although it also includes a full run of minor clubs, along with real and fictional circuits from all over the planet.   Baseball America. There is no visual wow here. The closest you come to ""graphics"" is the manual simulation screen, where you watch games played over a rudimentary diamond and a backdrop photo of the Phillies' Citizens Bank Park and follow the action by reading textual play-by-play while listening to canned crowd noise. This may be the most approachable OOTP yet, with loads of shortcuts on menu screens to keep you from getting lost in the number jungle, but it remains a long way from the friendly confines of an arcade-first sim like MLB 11: The Show.         Still, you don't need pretty pictures to enjoy OOTP 12. The depth is just incredible. Rosters are more thorough than ever, with full major league clubs as they sat on opening day 2011, along with a complete run of prospects, wannabes, and never-weres in A, AA, and AAA. Stats are tracked for just about every conceivable event that can take place on a ball diamond, so you can indulge your inner Bill James to your heart's content. Analyzing statistics and player ratings is key to any success you find on the field, along with some luck that projected ratings actually turn into real-world performance on the field. The most notable change to the artificial intelligence is how your bench bosses and managers fare when asked to fill out lineups. Before, you always got into ""Why the hell is that guy batting third?"" territory and had to do a fair bit of manual tweaking. Now, it's hard to pick out any serious flaws.     Player ratings are incredibly thorough, including everything from their ability to go deep to how they perform in the clubhouse. Drafting and developing based solely on stats and ratings is a crapshoot because you could easily wind up with a starting nine full of clubhouse cancers with terrible injury ratings or some me-first kids who won't even sign with your team. Little touches like this add strategic depth to building teams because you need to take all of these factors into account before making moves. Even something as potentially dull as the draft is fraught with tension because you always have to make the call on such questions like taking a risk on a potential phenom who is reportedly hard to sign or playing it safe with an average-number guy who is supposed to be easy to ink. Contracts are also much more involved when it comes to negotiating them with the addition of more personality-driven decisions, as well as things like bonus clauses and buyout options. It's all pretty byzantine, though, which makes it hard to figure out how to manage player transactions within your organization at first. At least the game provides lots of advice and warnings so you don't wind up doing something really idiotic, like designating your star shortstop for assignment when you're trying to stick him on the DL.     Storylines have been expanded to include just about everything that happens in the real world. You'll see such things as players taking leaves of absence over the death of a child, getting burned in bizarre kitchen mishaps, and being beaned by out-of-control pitching machines. Star players now have lives outside of baseball, too. As seasons progress, you'll witness such developments as your star shortstop opening up a winery or your speedy center fielder donating a kidney to his brother. Clubhouse tantrums sometimes result in suspensions or even serious injuries for things like punching a locker. You can even encounter weird situations like a prospect being judged older than he claims to be due to odd results of a DNA test, a prospect choosing basketball over baseball like a latter-day Danny Ainge, or a lawnmower accident ending a career due to the loss of a few fingers. This level of detail really sucks you into the game. At the same time, however, out-there situations do not occur often. Stories typically involve things like strained medial collateral ligaments and concussions, so don't worry about the game playing like a telenovela.        Multiplayer has also received some attention this year. The new OOTP makes it easier to get into one of the thousands of online leagues that have sprung up in recent years. You can now find a league within the game itself by logging in with a username and password and then browsing a server that is usually loaded with commissioners that are looking for fresh blood. This is the ideal way to play OOTP, so it's good to see that the developers are making it easier than ever to find a league and experience the cutthroat nature of taking on human rivals rather than the CPU.     Even though Out of the Park Baseball 12 breaks little completely new ground, the revamped rosters, refined AI, and deeper storylines do a lot to overhaul the feel of the game. With so many new ways to interact with your players, the game is more of a human simulator with a lot of numbers than a number cruncher without much of a human face, which makes for a game that is even harder to put down than its already estimable predecessors.  "
2232,Skylanders Swap Force,7.0,2," Invader Zim's Richard Steven Horvitz and Seinfeld's Patrick Warburton, adds warm humor and characterization that make the cutscenes a joy to watch. Horvitz provides a nigh-on-maniacal vocal energy in his role as Kaos, while Warburton slathers on intentional cheesiness as the pilot character Flynn. Little touches, such as a hot-swappable difficulty setting through the options menu, make it simple to adjust the difficulty to an easier setting if you are having trouble completing a level. Additional content, such as unlockable Time Attack and Score modes, offers new challenges and replay value to boot. Swap Force has a good underlying structure that makes it easy to enjoy. The game's responsive controls make things feel snappy as you blast away at enemies from afar or venture in close to stun or bash those around you. Swap Force pushes the enemies to swarm you as you jump and dodge out of the way, fighting back all the while. As the levels progress, you learn to manage the battle around you, stunning or taking out weaker or ranged-attack enemies first before going after stronger enemies. In the more frenzied moments, I found myself using melee attacks to buy distance to move in, ranged attacks to take out clusters of enemies in relative safety, and a special attack to telepathically hurl either a kitchen sink or a nearby opponent at nearby enemies to clear space. Although each enemy type tends to be limited to two or three basic attacks, Swap Force remains diverse by throwing a wide variety of foes at you. Each level features its own distinct units and works to a fevered pitch in which you simultaneously fight simple melee combatants, ranged attackers, and tougher, higher-end enemies. Role-playing elements deepen this simple but exciting foundation, allowing you to upgrade your character, equip items that improve your stats, gain new abilities, and become more formidable. One of the game's joys is that it doesn't spend too much time on any one thing. It's not just a straight shooter in which you slay hundreds of enemies in a given stage, or just a platformer in which you leap from one moving surface to the next. Instead, the game evenly blends melee fisticuffs, ranged battles, and environmental puzzles into a satisfying mix that draws you in and holds your attention. Swap Force taps into the sheer joy of experimenting with new character combinations. With Swap Force, you can physically split the magnetically attached top and bottom sections of your Skylanders figurines, joining them into new combinations and then warping them into your game. Once they're warped in, you can purchase new attacks and abilities for the top and bottom sections of your new characters on the fly via power-up stations found throughout the game and create cool new combinations, such as the half-robot, half-eagle warrior that I wound up using as my main character. Using these combinations don't substantially change the gameplay, but there's considerable joy in trying new combinations. In the case of my own character, I was able to blend my Skylander into a new unit complete with both strong ranged and melee attacks to create a character that could handle most combat situations it encountered. It's this kind of mixing, matching, and customizing that makes the game enjoyable to play, especially once you begin to experiment with new combinations. There's a definite sense of accomplishment in reaching your character's next level, though the game doesn't tell you which attributes, if any, have been upgraded upon reaching the next level. Instead, you see more defined changes to your characters through purchasing new abilities, attacks, and wearable inventory items, which might increase your health, boost your standard attack, and so on. In addition to a solid single-player campaign and unlockable Time Attack and Score modes, Swap Force features a Battle Arena mode where you can fight in Solo Survival, Team Survival, Rival Survival, and Ring Out modes, fighting with or against a human teammate. Arena battles work well enough, but don't evolve beyond basic button mashing, and feel like a side dish instead of a main course. Worse, Team Survival mode is punitive; players who die early in the game have to wait until their teammate beats the round or dies, because Swap Force fails to offer additional lives or a means of resurrecting friends. This flies in the face of the rest of the game's philosophy, which goes out of its way to be friendly and accessible; it's boring to wait around a few minutes before getting a chance to play some more. No matter how old you are, you might get annoyed with Swap Force's static camera, which doesn't always provide the best possible angle and will have you longing for more control of your view. A greater annoyance is also a returning one: you can't unlock certain sections without purchasing specific Skylanders figurines or collections of them, which can come at a steep price. True, the game arrives with either three or five Skylanders figures, but it also frequently subjects you to advertisements for new toys, which can make the whole experience feel like a crass marketing campaign. The game's mechanics also encourage you to run to the nearest toy store. In certain circumstances, the game states that your character has run out of energy, and needs to rest so that another Skylanders figurine can be swapped onto the Portal of Power and pick up where your other character left off. Despite its push to have you run out and buy additional figures, Skylanders Swap Force remains fun and charming for kids and adults alike. The new character combinations enhance the gameplay, expanding on what can be created and adding an interesting mechanic to the game. You may wind up shopping for new figures to unlock new content, which isn't a cheap habit to build, but Swap Force taps into the sheer joy of experimenting with new character combinations and building them from there."
4933,MLB Slam!,2.0,0," MLB Slam! is the first baseball game for the N-Gage, and, to be blunt, it's horrible. While it does attempt to stand up to other stat-heavy sports games by offering realistic roster and player statistics, the game itself is so simplistic that these numbers don't even come in to play in the slightest. Baseball fans looking for a realistic experience will be sorely disappointed by this game, and even the most casual of players will be bored within minutes by a baseball game that simply isn't fun to play.      Featuring all 30 Major League Baseball teams with rosters accurate for the 2003 season, MLB Slam! offers baseball fans the chance to play as their favorite teams with all the players you'd expect. It also has a handful of modes, such as the ability to play a full season or to play against other player via the N-Gage's built-in Bluetooth capabilities. However, the realism stops here. As a baseball game, and the first offering of its kind for the N-Gage, this game is far behind the times in terms of gameplay. While it is easy enough to pick up and play, it is also addled with bugs and quirks that make the game both simplistic and frustrating at the same time.   As previously mentioned, every MLB team is represented with an accurate roster. However, the players on the field and in the batter's box all look the same, save for a change in skin tone when appropriate. In addition to this, all batters share an identical strike zone, and they perform identically regardless of their real-life skills at the plate. Hitting a ball is as easy as moving a target to where the pitch will cross the plate and pressing the swing button at the correct time. Within just a few innings, you'll find yourself scoring a huge number of runs with little opposition.   On the defensive side, MLB Slam! takes a similarly simple approach. Fielding is generally taken care of automatically, although on occasion, your player simply won't even attempt to move after a ball that's been hit into play. Likewise, sometimes he may fail to respond when instructed to move. This alone makes the fielding portion of the game frustrating. Stranger still, you can make infield plays to first base before your infielder even has possession of the ball, which makes ground balls easy outs every time. In short, this portion of the game is, for all intents and purposes, unfinished.   Finally, pitching--as you might expect--is also rudimentarily presented. You're given an assortment of two to four pitches to choose from, a target within the strike zone where you'd like the ball to cross the plate, and a basic power meter to determine how fast your pitch will be. By carefully working the corners of the strike zone, you can easily overpower the opposing team's batters every time. In all, MLB Slam! is a simple baseball game that fails to play solidly, let alone implement the player statistics that it contains. To make matters worse, the longer you play the game, the worse it runs. As your game stretches on into the later innings, you'll often find the game slowing down, and you'll encounter some considerable difficulties with button response to presses, thus making the game virtually unplayable at times.      Visually, MLB Slam! looks and sounds as good as it plays. As mentioned before, every player on the field looks exactly the same, and each is poorly rendered with just a few frames of animation. You're given the choice of several different stadiums to play in, and, of course, they all look the same. Additionally, the game is also mostly silent. While the game does offer sound that is triggered by certain events, such as a strikeout or a home run, the audio is heavily compressed and sounds tinny. Just as outfielders won't chase after balls on occasion, the game's sounds also fail to trigger some of the time.   In all, MLB Slam! is a game that is impossible to recommend to anyone. Its poorly designed gameplay and boring, bug-filled graphics would prevent even the most rabid baseball fan from enjoying what is presented."
368,Mundaun,8.0,2,"The journey, rather than the destination, is the focus of Mundaun--the reasons you take it and the travel required to reach its conclusion. In this way, it feels like a spiritual successor to Half-Life 2's Highway 17, a mid-game chapter that finds crowbar-toting protagonist Gordon Freeman traveling by buggy along the lonely coast. It's a lengthy, melancholy section of the 2004 shooter where the driving is occasionally interrupted by combat, puzzles, and on-foot exploration. Mundaun is like Highway 17 expanded to a full 10-hour experience. In your journey to the mountaintop, you sit passively in a bus, drive a hay-baling truck along bumpy terrain, and ride a sled across quiet alpine slopes. You're guided through a series of dark, labyrinthine tunnels by a trolley car the size of a toaster. You ride a chair lift. The inclusion of vehicles might not sound noteworthy on its own, but traversing the mountain in all these different ways--on foot, by sled, by truck--has the effect of making the mountain feel like a real place; a peak that must be considered to be conquered. You don't cover dozens of virtual miles in your quest, but Mundaun feels like a journey nonetheless--personal and physical--as a result of this fixation on the vehicles we use to make our pilgrimages.This horror adventure game's distinct point of view is obvious the moment you see it in action. Each first-person frame looks like hand-drawn pencil art, and the entire game is presented in black and white. Developer Hidden Fields uses this to terrific, eerie effect. The mountain lake where those beekeepers are doing their work is beautifully alien, a rocky landscape that's empty except for these strange beings in their protective suits accompanied by an unnerving buzzing. Night on the mountain's snowy slopes feels eerie in a different way--dark, save for the light of the moon, and quiet, save for the sound of your snowshoes or sled on the powder. With winning art and sound design, Hidden Fields brilliantly brings home the feeling that you are alone, and that this lonely journey is one you must take on your own.As that journey begins, protagonist Curdin sits on a bus winding its way up narrow mountain roads to the sleepy alpine town where he often visited his grandfather growing up. The young man is returning to the village to attend his grandfather's funeral after receiving news that the old man died when his barn caught fire. But something's wrong. Despite the village priest's claims that his grandfather was already buried, Curdin finds a charred corpse in the barn. When he goes to see the priest, the chapel is locked. He goes to the graveyard--grandfather's grave is empty. As Curdin attempts to get to the bottom of these mysterious events, he begins a trek to the top of the mountain, whose towering pincer-like twin peaks can be seen from almost anywhere in the game.This overarching mystery--what happened to grandfather?--is interspersed with smaller questions presented by the game's strange iconography. You go to sleep with a spiked paddle balanced on your chest to ward off evil spirits. You defend yourself against malevolent beekeepers with puffs of pipe smoke. You engage in meaningful conversations with the disembodied head of a goat. It may sound like weirdness for weirdness' sake, but Mundaun's refreshingly eccentric perspective has the effect of giving you itches that you can only scratch by continuing to play.It takes some time for the game to fully come into its own, though. When you first arrive on the mountain, the church is locked, the graveyard is locked, and multiple rooms in grandfather's house are locked. The solution to enter the graveyard involves hearing a girl's singing and a goat's bleating--which initially seem like they might just be background noise--looking up on top of a cliff where the goat and girl are standing, and talking to the girl, who will then throw a paper airplane that loops around the steeple, causing the sun to move. This casts a ray of light to a tree near the graveyard, where you can now find the key. I'm spoiling this puzzle because it's the only bad one in the game. The dream logic required to progress here is an annoying early roadblock in a game that otherwise relies on concrete solutions to concrete problems. I was compelled by the mysteries and by the promise of the locked doors, but frustrated that all my early efforts were funneled to this unintuitive skill check.Once you progress past this obstacle, though, Mundaun has terrific pacing as you progress up the mountain--a varied loop that cycles effortlessly from on-foot exploration to puzzle-solving to vehicle-based traversal to combat to playable flashbacks that reveal your grandfather's past. I always had something to do and somewhere to go, and each new location cried out for exploration. This is driven by the main plot, to be sure. But it's also driven by smaller tasks along the way. For example, making coffee is an optional task that's introduced early in the game. If you find all the components--a cup, coffee grounds, a pot, a pump to fill that pot with water, a stove and a piece of wood and matches to light a fire--you can brew and drink a cup of coffee, which permanently raises your health. This optional quest was a welcome break if I ever felt stumped on where to go next.In the early game, the only weapons you have access to are breakable pitchforks, which you may or may not be able to reach when an enemy appears. As you attempt to escape your pursuers, an extra bit of health may be the difference between success and death. So, in addition to desiring to explore because the game's locations are beautiful and varied, I wanted to explore to find coffee grounds. In the process, I often found something unsettling, helpful, or both. A monstrous biped made of haunted hay. A hut filled with hanging carcasses that make music when you touch them. A paper boat serenely floating on a lake's surface inked up with clues from some unseen benefactor on how to defend yourself against an enemy. Mundaun's hills are alive with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.The initial segment in the village concludes with Curdin gaining access to his grandfather's hay truck, which you can use to travel more quickly up the roads. And, as you travel ever upward, the personal component of your trek is slowly revealed through playable flashbacks. Through these eerie scenes, you get glimpses of Curdin's grandfather's involvement in a war decades before and a deal with a mysterious, malevolent figure who spared the lives of him and the men in his regiment. These story threads are introduced early on when you meet that dark figure near the wreckage of your grandfather's barn. He clutches your wrist, leaving you marked with a charcoal black hand. As you continue, these threads serve as connective tissue between your current journey and your grandfather's past, woven through each leg of the journey. You meet a character who knew your grandfather; another character descended from one of your grandfather's contemporaries. Each has ties to events we have seen unfold in the past. These links communicate that our journey is connected to the broader history of the mountain and that, as we uncover the mystery of what happened to grandfather, we are also unearthing the community's dark secrets.The environment, and the secrets it hides, is as interesting as any personal revelation. When you reach your grandfather's house, you are immediately confronted with multiple locked doors, and the process of discovering how to unlock them is slow but rewarding. In its mechanics as in its storytelling, Mundaun effectively mixes long-term question marks (Where will I find the key to unlock grandfather's study?) with concrete short-term goals (I need to enter the chapel to progress the story). Some puzzles on the route to solving these problems are a little obtuse, but most are satisfying to solve. I especially enjoyed one that required that I find the right spot to stop a model truck on its tracks to open a hidden drawer. Additionally, the presence of locked supply rooms that you can use any of a number of disposable keys to open and stoves where you can prepare coffee to increase your health kept me interested in exploration, even when I wasn't sure what to do to advance the critical path. All of these tasks have a central aim: progressing further up the mountain or preparing yourself for what you will face as you progress up the mountain. As a result, even momentary diversions have an enjoyable utility. None of this feels like a waste of time. How could it? Is it a waste of time to pack your bag before a flight?Unfortunately, in its prerelease state, Mundaun is beset by bugs as disruptive as a flat tire. For example, at one point, while riding on a ski lift, the lift stopped. My mouse look was suddenly, inexplicably limited to the vertical axis. I couldn't tell if this was intentional or a bug. After a while, I restarted the game and played through this same section again. Again, my movement was limited to looking up and down. I tried every item in my inventory, hit every button; nothing worked. Eventually, out of desperation, I restarted the game a second time. When I reached the same section on this try, my vision was unhindered and I easily figured out how to progress. I encountered similar problems at multiple junctures, and this kind of bugginess sows doubt about whether you're actually stumped by a puzzle or hobbled by jank.Mundaun is an adventure game first and foremost, but it does include combat. The weapons at your disposal are limited to breakable pitchforks and an heirloom rifle. Combat isn't particularly involved, but the presence of enemies helps to differentiate the free and easy exploration of the day from the anxiety-inducing sprints of the eerie night. Using the rifle never feels twitchy; you slowly line up shots, and the gun moves back and forth with your breath. Much of the game passes before you acquire this weapon, but, even once you get it, Mundaun remains a horror adventure game, first and foremost. The shots that you must fire are rare and the rifle's report is a loud, echoing crack. It feels like you are breaking the mountain's quiet peace, disrupting the inherent solitude of the place, each time you fire off a round.Thankfully, your time on the mountain runs low on ammunition and high on strange, wonderful mystery. Mundaun is a darkly original work. This is an impeccably paced game with satisfying gameplay that fits hand-in-glove with its narrative focus on the process of taking a journey. That journey is rich in atmosphere and imagery, sustained by questions until it is satisfied with clever answers. My trek was well worth the effort for the view from the peak."
4792,History Channel's Crusades: Quest for Power,3.0,0," Crusades: Quest for Power may bear the logo of The History Channel, but the only thing this half-baked RTS teaches us is a lesson in terrible game design. Any notion that this budget title is somewhat educational is dashed by a simplistic focus on tank rush-style combat and killing enemies for gold. It is also something of a buggy mess that has nothing to do with the actual Crusades and even less to do with fulfilling, engaging gameplay.      Actually, it's pretty difficult to even tell what sort of gameplay the developers are trying to present here. Crusades is ostensibly a traditional real-time strategy game, in that you build bases, collect resources, and crank out units. But it is so stripped-down that at times it feels like a blend of Age of Empires and Diablo. Scenarios are fast-paced and jammed with right-click combat, so they often have the atmosphere of an isometric hack-and-slash RPG. You even have to pick up sacks of gold that are dropped by slain enemies, and you must also open treasure chests containing holy relics.   The RTS elements are as flimsy as the scenery in a grade-school play. Building your armies involves nothing more than erecting infantry, bowman, and crusader/holy warrior tents and issuing build orders for the respective units. Gold is the only resource. Combat is so fast-paced that there is no need for tactical thinking. Abysmal pathfinding would negate such strategizing even if it were an option. Every scenario is a tank rush where you band-select groups of soldiers and their supporting holy men healers and then have at it. There isn't much of a challenge in any of this, either. The developer seems to be aiming for the casual gamer, and, as a result, anyone with the tiniest amount of RTS experience will be able to breeze through the missions featured in the Eastern and Western campaigns. Since there aren't any multiplayer modes, and there's just a cheap ""instant action"" skirmish option that features a pair of maps, you can see all there is to see in just three or four hours.   History is also barely there. Units are generic medieval soldiers who wield generic swords and bows. Crusaders look like the popular conception of the medieval knight, complete with heavy silver armor, jug-shaped helmets, and bloodred crosses on their tunics. Saracen holy warriors look like the Western conception of a medieval Arab, meaning that they wield scimitars and look like something out of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Stereotypes are something of a hallmark of the game design.   The scenarios don't make reference to historical events, and they often don't even make sense. Much of the Eastern campaign, for instance, has the Saracens defending the capital of their Byzantine archenemies. The very Christian city of Constantinople (in the time period of the Crusades, that is) is decked out with mosques, and the Muslim Saracens bizarrely fight to save the Church of the Holy Wisdom from ""sacrilege"" in one mission. In a further oddity, Christian artifacts are stocked in the mystery treasure chests in both campaigns. This presents you with the strange spectacle of seeing Muslim holy men being blessed with monk's robes and flasks of holy water. It's hard to believe that this game has the seal of approval from The History Channel.   Presentation values are somewhat higher than expected for a budget game. Graphically, Crusades looks pretty good. The fully 3D engine does a nice job with soldiers and backdrops, though the lack of variety in unit types takes a toll after just a couple of scenarios in each campaign. Zono has done a great job with the camera. You can zoom right in on the action and pan out to see a tactical view of what's developing in the distance, though the latter isn't useful because enemies just pop into view from out of thin air. There are also some nice flourishes, like Christian soldiers who run around cartoonishly and scream whenever they're set alight by a Saracen flaming arrow.   The audio doesn't fare as well. The musical score consists of a flute-heavy tune that sounds vaguely Middle Eastern but is hampered by being about 10 seconds long. It constantly loops and gets so irritating so fast that you'll be hard-pressed to keep away from that mute button for more than a couple of minutes. Voice acting is handled with all the ethnic sensitivity of a 1940s Bugs Bunny cartoon. The developers don't even get this right, as they give the Arab Saracens overblown Indian accents more befitting of Apu from The Simpsons than Saladin.      Bugs are another major problem. It's pretty obvious that Zono made this game on the cheap, but was it really necessary to skimp on quality control? The game was initially unplayable because of a problem that locked the mouse cursor into the top right corner of the opening menu screen. Switching from a cordless mouse to one of the corded variety solved the problem, though only momentarily. While the game could then be started, the cursor often went astray, would momentarily get stuck, or would wind up becoming immovable in that top right corner again. Occasionally, the cursor refused to budge when the game was loaded, forcing a Ctrl-Alt-Del restart. Then the game wouldn't come back until Windows was rebooted. Incidentally, reducing video acceleration (which often helps when facing cursor troubles) did nothing to correct this problem.   About the only unabashedly good thing you can say about Crusades: Quest for Power is that it retails for just $20 as part of the Activision Value Publishing line. Even this isn't a deal, as you can find much better and far more stable RTS games in the bargain bin for the same price or less.  "
4525,Mighty Bomb Jack,4.0,0,"  Mighty Bomb Jack is the video game equivalent of Vanilla Ice or pump sneakers. When the game was first released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, people took note of its jump-heavy design and charming graphics and snapped it up, assuming it would satisfy their craving for a Mario fix. Mighty Bomb Jack was the hottest thing going for a few months, until word got out that it was nothing like Super Mario Bros., and was, in fact, just a crummy side-scroller steeped in goofy charm. Bear in mind, this was in the days before rentals, video game magazines, message boards, and the Internet, so word of mouth was slower to propagate back then.         As with so many 2D action games from the 1980s, the main problem with Mighty Bomb Jack is that it has heart but lacks substance. The backgrounds put together with Mario-style blocks are colorful, and Jack himself is cute as a button clad in his red tights and superhero cape. Jack's enemies are cartoonish renditions of snakes and mummies, and the main bad guy is a demon named Belzebut. The soundtrack is full of circus tunes that genuinely make you want to bob your head. For about two minutes, the game will charm your socks off. Then, you'll notice how repetitive the backgrounds are, and that the developers didn't even bother to animate the flames that occupy so much space in the environment. Around the same time, you'll realize how shallow the action is. The whole game revolves around running and jumping your way through vertical and horizontal passages populated with platforms, treasure chests, and deadly lava beds while monsters randomly appear and chase after you. That's not a bad formula to build upon, but the level layouts are simplistic and every passage contains the same kinds of platforms, chests, and enemies. You can spend the power coins you collect to open up locked chests and to temporarily transform enemies into gold coins. Otherwise, Jack has no abilities apart from jumping.     You can adjust the height and distance of Jack's jumps depending on how long you hold the jump button down and what direction you press. Unfortunately, the controls aren't very precise, because you're just as likely to smash into the ceiling as you are to fall straight down. The game gets all of its difficulty from errant jumps brought about by the sketchy controls and the tendency for monsters to materialize in front of you midflight. As you can imagine, fighting with the controls and interacting with the same chests and enemies gets old fast. Ironically, there are plenty of secret rooms to discover, and figuring out the right route through all of the interconnected passages can take a while.      Adding insult to injury, the game actually punishes you for being too skilled at it. If you collect too many power coins or increase the timer above a certain point by collecting drink items, you'll be sent to a torture room filled with enemies that's almost guaranteed to rob you of one of your three lives. You can escape by jumping a certain number of times, but doing so is practically impossible due to the number of enemies combined with the busted jumping controls.     Based on its initial popularity, the NES version of Mighty Bomb Jack has probably earned its spot in the Wii's Virtual Console. But that historical significance is literally the only reason you should even consider wasting 500 Wii points ($5) to download Mighty Bomb Jack, since 20 years has done nothing to change how mind-numbing and broken the game is.

85,Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,8.0,2,"The first boss fight in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is right up there with the toughest first bosses in video game history. This opening battle pits you against Zhang Liang of the Yellow Turbans, as you clash in a kinetic two-phase fight to the death. It's an intense skill check that challenges your prowess of Wo Long's mechanics almost immediately. In many ways, it feels like a rite of passage for the rest of the game and a bold statement of intent from developer Team Ninja. I initially loved how it forced me to adapt to the demands of the game's particular brand of Souls-like combat, yet the further I progressed, the more this feeling dissipated as I realized that this introductory struggle was little more than an unbalanced outlier, providing a much sterner test than the bosses following it.For many, this sudden difficulty spike will be a barrier to entry, halting progress a mere 10 minutes into the game. It's a shame Wo Long begins with such a sturdy roadblock, not least because this initial undertaking isn't indicative of the rest of the game moving forward. In fact, outside of this first boss, Team Ninja has crafted one of the more approachable Souls-likes in what is a traditionally challenging genre.I didn't encounter another boss fight on par with Zhang Liang's difficulty until roughly 15 hours into Wo Long's campaign. Most of the bosses in between were a relative cakewalk, to the point where I was able to cut down each one on my first attempt--usually in under a minute. I still had fun dispatching every single one, but the ease with which I was able to do so makes them lose some of their luster and reinforces the notion that the first boss is at odds with the rest of the game. The battle with Zhang Liang sets up expectations that never come to fruition, particularly when other fights allow you to summon help from either AI or human teammates.Team Ninja has experience developing difficult games, of course, with the likes of Ninja Gaiden and Nioh under its belt. Elements of both those games are present in Wo Long, yet its combat feels like a streamlined offshoot of From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, putting an emphasis on deflecting attacks and breaking your opponent's stance. I say it's streamlined because while enemies frequently unleash powerful unblockable attacks, you only need to deflect them by nailing the timing of a single button press. There aren't any sweep or grab attacks requiring different techniques to counter and avoid, so it doesn't have the same kind of depth. The timing window to deflect is relatively generous, and these attacks--known as Critical Blows--are clearly telegraphed, so it doesn't take long before you're misdirecting strikes left, right, and center. The challenge comes from being able to recognize which attack is coming and knowing when to time the deflection so you're not too early or too late. You can block regular physical attacks and dodge out of danger as well, but mastering the deflect mechanic is the optimal way to succeed. Plus, nothing beats the satisfaction of parrying an incoming blow and seeing the sparks fly as steel collides with steel.Wo Long doesn't utilize a traditional stamina system to rein you in. Instead, you have a Spirit gauge that either decreases or increases depending on your actions. You can build it by striking enemies and deflecting their attacks, then consume this positive Spirit to increase the power of your offense. Actions like dodging, mistiming deflections, performing weapon-specific special moves, and casting Wizardry Spells all decrease your Spirit, as does sustaining damage from an enemy attack. If your Spirit is in the negative and you take a hit that pushes the gauge to the lower limit, you become defenseless for a short period of time. This creates a balancing act where you want to build up enough positive Spirit to make full use of your repertoire without succumbing to this staggered state.Crucially, each enemy you fight also has a Spirit gauge of its own, so skirmishes often focus on whittling down your foe's defenses as opposed to concentrating squarely on damaging their health bar. You can lower the enemy's Spirit by simply attacking them, but utilizing special moves and deflections--parrying Critical Blows, in particular--will significantly deplete it. Once their Spirit gauge hits the lower limit, they'll enter a stunned state, giving you ample opportunity to unleash a devastating Fatal Strike that wipes out a chunk of their health. The variety of different enemy types you'll face doesn't make this easy, especially when you're dealing with multiple opponents at the same time, but Wo Long's learning curve isn't particularly steep. Once it all clicks, combat falls into this thrilling back-and-forth groove built around stylish deflections and quick bursts of over-the-top violence, and Team Ninja has also implemented a number of other considerations to ease players in.You have a double jump at your disposal, which lends the game a sense of mobility reminiscent of Ryu Hayabusa's exploits in Ninja Gaiden. There's a high degree of verticality present in the level design to account for this, encouraging you to leap onto rooftops and guard towers to survey the battlefield from up high. From here, you can perform a lunging strike to significantly damage an unaware enemy, while stealth attacks serve a similar purpose when your feet are planted on the ground. Both techniques allow you to dispatch a number of enemies before they even have a chance to strike back, so you don't always have to confront each foe mano a mano. This incentivizes you to pay attention to your surroundings as there's usually a way to get the drop on any unsuspecting assailants if you look hard enough.There are more subtle ways Wo Long softens the experience compared to other Souls-likes as well. Battle Flags, which are this game's equivalent of bonfires, replenish all of your health and healing items the first time you find them, without requiring you to sit down and rest. This means you can get topped back up and carry on without respawning all of the enemies you just killed, thus making exploration a tad more inviting. When you do die, you only lose half of the experience points you accumulated up to that point. You can still earn it all back by killing the enemy that bested you, but only losing half instead of the full amount prevents it from feeling like you're starting back at square one every time you die. These two examples might not sound like much, but they have a palpable impact on Wo Long's difficulty by deftly scaling back on some of the genre's more vexing idiosyncrasies.However, it's the inclusion of near-constant AI companions that does the most to ease up on the usual challenge. Wo Long puts a dark fantasy spin on the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history. Similar to how Nioh drew on its historical Japanese setting and relevant mythology, Wo Long weaves Chinese mythology and fantasy elements into its interpretation of this popular period in China's history. As a result, you'll fight alongside the likes of Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and others, with one or two NPC fighters joining you depending on where they fit in the story. You can still dismiss these legendary warriors if you want to go it alone, and you're also able to summon up to two allies if you start a level without any. The AI doesn't tend to dish out too much damage, however, and it has a habit of getting stuck on scenery. It has its uses, though, usually by keeping enemies busy and ensuring that you're not overwhelmed when fighting groups of foes. You can also replace these NPCs with friends if you'd prefer to play the whole game in co-op, with the game's difficulty scaling up to compensate. Or you can summon random players to help you take down a tricky boss or section, so there are plenty of options for those seeking assistance.The levels themselves aren't quite as sprawling as those found in the Nioh series. The game is still split up into distinct levels, with optional sub-battles unlocking throughout the campaign. These bite-sized stages send you back to previously visited locations where you'll clear a few rooms, face off against waves of enemies, or take on a boss. Sub-battles don't usually take very long to complete, and you're rewarded with loot and XP so they're worth doing. In terms of level design, rather than featuring long-winded detours that circle back on themselves, most of Wo Long's branching paths lead to dead ends with higher-level enemies and more loot. It's a tad disappointing that it doesn't regularly tap into the sense of both relief and wonderment you get from looping paths, but Team Ninja has opted for a different approach to exploration that feels fresh.Both you and every opponent you face has a Morale Rank that indicates their strength in battle. Simply defeating enemies will raise this rank, but it shoots up quicker if you kill an enemy with a higher Morale Rank than yourself. Wo Long still has a traditional progression system where you spend XP to level up stats like health and damage; the Morale Rank is there to indicate how your strength compares to the enemies you're fighting in a single level. It resets to zero at the beginning of each stage, so you tend to find lower-level enemies when you first arrive at a location. This isn't always the case, though. One path might contain an imposing figure with a significantly higher Morale Rank than yourself. You can still defeat these enemies, but it's a dicey proposition, as one wrong move is usually more than enough to kill you. It depends on whether you want to take the risk for the chance of being rewarded with a significant boost of your own Morale Rank.When you die, your Morale Rank decreases, but it will never drop below your Fortitude Rank. This separate but intertwined ranking can be increased by raising Battle Flags and Marking Flags. The latter don't function as checkpoints like Battle Flags do, but there are usually half a dozen or so dotted around each level, all with the express purpose of raising your Fortitude. Some are hidden off the beaten path, while others are guarded by powerful foes you need to defeat first. Not only does this encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of each level, but it also urges you to take risks and challenge tougher enemies you might not have otherwise bothered with. There's no glory in playing it safe, and taking risks earlier will pay off further down the line when your strength either matches or overpowers your enemies.Increasing your Morale Rank also gives you access to more Wizardry Spells. These mystic techniques can be unleashed by consuming Spirit, with each one falling into one of five elemental categories: Earth, water, wood, fire, and metal. Some of these spells are self-explanatory, letting you conjure the likes of fireballs, pointed icicles, and exploding rock pillars. Others are less obvious, such as wood spells being based entirely around lightning, while metal sorcery focuses on poisonous toxins. You can only equip four at a time, which feels somewhat limiting, but these spells do add an extra layer of depth to combat. They're not all offense-based either, with some spells allowing you to strengthen your defenses by coating yourself in rocks or restore lost health by dealing damage to enemies. There's also a rock, paper, scissors mechanic at play where wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and so on, but it's not something I ever really noticed. You can deflect elemental attacks with your weapon so I was never compelled to go out of my way to counter a magic-using enemy with spells of my own.The loot in Wo Long has been significantly toned down in comparison to Nioh and especially Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. Enemies don't constantly drop gear when defeated, so loot drops feel more spaced out and earned. Every item you pick up, whether it's a weapon or a piece of armor, has a star rating attached to it that's essentially a rough gauge of its quality. Baseline stats like damage and defense aren't overly affected by these ratings. Instead, the rarer the loot, the more special effects it has, which add passive bonuses to modify certain stats. You can visit a blacksmith to upgrade the main properties of your gear using various materials, so once I attained a full set of four-star gear I saw little reason to change unless I wanted to try out a new weapon type. The rest of the loot was quickly scavenged for more materials or sold for money, so there's still a moment in between each level where you'll typically rummage through all of the loot you want to get rid of.Wo Long has a fairly large assortment of different weapon types, ranging from straight sabers and dual blades to polearms and great wooden hammers. While the basic move set is the same for each armament within a single weapon type, each individual weapon feels distinct because of its unique Martial Arts. These special moves are flashy melee attacks that are stronger than regular attacks; the caveat is that they consume a portion of the Spirit gauge with each use. Some of these Martial Arts are focused on damaging a single enemy multiple times, while others excel when against a group or to close the distance on an opponent. They add another exciting wrinkle to Wo Long's combat, to the point where you're incentivized to experiment with weapons you might not otherwise try.Unfortunately, the game also suffers from a few technical issues. Stuttering and slowdown are both frequent annoyances on PC, where poor optimization ensures that altering the settings does little to alleviate these problems. I never encountered a situation where this hampered my ability to defeat enemies, so timing deflections wasn't affected by it, but it's still disappointing that another PC release is launching in such a haphazard state. It should be noted that someone else playing the game on PS5 didn't encounter the same issues, so it's likely these problems are confined to PC.The fact that Wo Long's demo features the first two levels and carries your save over to the full game is a boon for those who might otherwise be put off. It gives you the opportunity to challenge the first boss for yourself and find out whether it's the barrier to entry I imagine it will be for many players. If you can defeat Zhang Liang, the game that follows is a thrilling yet approachable addition to the Souls-like genre. Its parry-based combat is frequently stellar, and Team Ninja has made a number of smart changes to keep Wo Long feeling fresh, even if there's always a tinge of familiarity. It has its issues, but if you're craving a fast-paced action RPG built on satisfying combat, Wo Long ticks most of the right boxes."
4332,Bankshot Billiards 2,4.0,0,"  The most expensive game available to download on Xbox Live Arcade at launch with a price tag of 1,200 Microsoft Points ($15), Bankshot Billiards 2 is a pool game that boasts no fewer than nine different modes of play, as well as Xbox Live support for up to three players. In addition to the regular 8-ball and 9-ball gameplay modes that you'd expect to find in any pool game, Bankshot Billiards 2 lets you take on the CPU or another player at Euro 8-ball, 14.1 continuous, or 3-ball. A three-player game titled cutthroat is also included, along with single-player golf, time trial, and trick shot options. Bankshot Billiards 2 is a decent-looking package as far as the menu screen is concerned, then; but once you get to the table, the game consistently disappoints.        One of the first things that you'll notice about Bankshot Billiards 2, particularly if you're playing on an HDTV, is that its visuals are simple but convincing. The game is played exclusively from a bird's-eye view, using a camera situated directly above the table, and while the table itself and the cue mysteriously floating in the air above it are nothing special, the lighting and the shadows on the balls make them look really solid. Furthermore, you can customize the look of just about everything in the game to suit your tastes, including the table, the cloth, the floor surrounding the table, the balls, and your cue. What's unfortunate is that the customization options for the gameplay aren't nearly so impressive.      One of the most intriguing things about the sport of pool is that there are so many different rule variations, to the extent that they can vary from one bar to the next. Bankshot Billiards 2 doesn't let you adjust the rules of your chosen game at all, though, save for determining how many racks are needed to win a match. It's also worth noting that at no point are you given an opportunity to read up on said rules, so you're left to figure them out for yourself through trial and error. The only other significant gameplay options available are a shot timer, skill level settings for CPU players, and three different levels of aiming assistance. Regardless of your skill level choice, the CPU players are an erratic bunch, prone to moments of genius or baffling stupidity practically every time you play them.     The aiming assistance system isn't without its problems either, because playing with no assistance enabled whatsoever makes it very difficult to know where even the white ball is headed, while opting for level 2 or level 3 assistance invariably makes the game a walk in the park if you have even the faintest idea of how to play in real life. Level 1 aiming aids, which show you where you're hitting the white ball but not where any of the object balls are going, should be the happy medium, but the onscreen arrow doesn't do a particularly good job of letting you know where you're actually going to make contact with whichever ball you're aiming for. None of the aiming aids would be much of an issue if the game let you move the camera around, of course, but it doesn't.     After lining up a shot in Bankshot Billiards 2, you'll be able to use a simple interface to determine the angle at which you hit the cue ball, the power of your shot, and whether you'll be applying any topspin, draw, or English to the cue ball by striking it somewhere other than dead center. The system is both intuitive and effective, but you certainly won't need to master it to succeed in many of Bankshot Billiards 2's gameplay modes. The only exceptions, in fact, are golf and trick shots, which demand a decent level of cue ball control.      With that said, the pockets on the Bankshot Billiards 2 table often seem like black holes sucking in any ball that strays anywhere near them, so having the skill to keep the white ball as far away from them as possible will definitely give you an advantage. The table in Bankshot Billiards 2 is also noticeably faster than most that you'll encounter, with balls sometimes appearing to stop only because they hit another ball or find their way into a pocket--which they often will. The sound effects associated with balls hitting each other or getting sunk are realistic, but the game boasts only five instantly forgettable looping music tracks to listen to while you play, simply titled electronic, rock, funk, pop, and lounge.         Unsurprisingly, there aren't a whole lot of Xbox 360 owners playing Bankshot Billiards 2 online right now, so while playing against a human opponent is undoubtedly preferable to taking on a CPU player, actually finding someone to pit your skills against can be a real challenge. When playing online, the game also froze up on us on more than one occasion, frustratingly forcing both us and our opponent to return to the main menu screen.     Bankshot Billiards 2, then, isn't nearly as good a package as its menu screen suggests it might be. And with a price tag of 1,200 Microsoft Points, it certainly doesn't represent good value for money, particularly when you consider that PC versions of three of its nine gameplay modes can be downloaded for free from MSN's Games Zone. If you've got Microsoft Points burning a hole in your pocket, there are plenty of better things you can do with them than purchase Bankshot Billiards 2.  "
3851,Mah Jong Tiles Deluxe,5.0,1,"  Mah Jong Tiles Deluxe is just like every single other Mah Jong game out there. We mean that quite literally, as there isn't really a single thing to separate it from the rest of the Mah Jong titles on MSN Games, let alone any of the roughly half-billion freeware Mah Jong games available across the Internet.     Sure, Mah Jong Tiles Deluxe features a nice-looking interface and plenty of different puzzle layouts to choose from, but that's really about it. You play the puzzles, it keeps your high score, and that's the extent of it. Games like Mah Jong Quest and Mah Jong Medley at least provide multiple game modes and more extensive puzzle modes; the former even has a crazy single-player quest mode that's hours long. By no means is Mah Jong Tiles Deluxe broken, but it's just not worth the money compared to what else is available.  "
1907,The Walking Dead: Season Two - A Telltale Games Series,9.0,2," Glimmers of hope are as hard to find here as shafts of light in a coal mine. The story continues precisely where episode three, In Harm's Way, left off, with the increasingly mature Clementine and the surviving members of her band of buddies using zombie-guts camouflage to sneak through an undead herd besieging the box-store empire of villain Bill Carver. A brief, if brutal, moment of optimism at the end of the last episode turns horrific in short order, and that sets the tone for the rest of the unrelentingly depressing two hours or so needed to play through to (another) cliff-hanger conclusion. Most of the plot plays out in a Civil War historical battle site (the fictional Parker's Run) cemetery and tourist visitor center where the survivors of the opening zombie race regroup. This setting is oddly apropos (even if the continued attention given to a statue of one soldier carrying another off the battlefield beats you over the head with the thesis that we all have to help one another in tough times), given the conflict developing between members of the group. Kenny is unfairly blaming Clementine. Luke gets slammed for taking part in an, um, entertaining interlude with Jane. Sarah is still a total mess who continues to aggravate everyone. And despite all of this, the group still has to work together to find a safe spot for the heavily pregnant Rebecca to deliver her baby.    What's more, Jane is proven right through the course of the game. No matter how much I chose the good-guy path in dialogue selections (which seem to have increased both in number and in the starkness of the choices they offer in comparison to the previous episodes), bad things kept on happening. Encouraging Jane to change her ways and start helping other people only succeeded in delaying the inevitable. Meaning that the person I was trying to save died anyway, but with the added benefit of putting other lives in jeopardy, too. This was finally hammered home toward the end of the episode. After I convinced Jane to take a huge chance on trying to save a helpless friend, I was given a prime seat at the table alongside a zombie buffet. Reactions to these deaths (which are unavoidable no matter which dialogue choices you select, according to Telltale) are also becoming increasingly muted. The chowdown referred to above would have been a defining moment just last episode. Now it takes place and everyone moves on almost instantly. Granted, the gang is a little preoccupied with the birth of Rebecca's baby, and this death is one that has been telegraphed for a good long time now. But it's incredible how the group watches this horrifying scene and adopts a ""Well, that happened"" (a fitting line that Mike uses to describe an incident with a zombie earlier in the game) attitude, and then the next scene you see is Clementine and the others taking a nap. "
4174,Surf's Up,4.0,0,"  Surf's Up for the Game Boy Advance is a racing game in which all of the participants are penguins riding atop surfboards. The general idea is that you're supposed to outrun three other opponents to the end of a side-scrolling course loaded with obstacles, jump ramps, and grind rails. For the first 10 minutes or so, the game is genuinely fun because you're figuring out what to do and discovering all kinds of fancy trick moves. However, after the initial break-in period, you'll quickly tire of smoking the competition and repeatedly performing the same tricks. As it is, the whole game can be completed in a couple of hours.        The game's various courses scroll by automatically, and as they do, you move your penguin character up or down to avoid floating rocks and to take advantage of jump ramps, grind rails, waterspouts, or other fun launchers. Grabbing star symbols and other items fills your boost gauge, which lets you put the pedal to the metal, so to speak. Geek, Tank, and Chicken Joe from the movie are also trying to win the race. If they get too close, you can press one of the shoulder buttons to slap them like Whitney did Bobby B. You can also perform tricks while flying through the air. There are only five different tricks, performed by pressing the B button and a direction, but you can string them together into crazy, long chains.     Even though the blue-gray backgrounds look crude by today's standards, cute animated details, such as splashy landings and big crashing waves, constantly enliven the surroundings. Cody, Lani, and all of the other movie characters are very colorful. Their trick animations are also generally fluid, not to mention goofy. The splish-splash sound effects and looping rock riffs are appropriate, though they won't make you want to crank up the volume.        There's a period of about 10 minutes during which the game will hold your attention. You're smacking penguins upside the head, performing tricks while sailing through the air, and generally having a good time. Unfortunately, the thrill soon wears off once you realize that CPU opponents can't keep up with you. You'll also realize that you're always seeing the same ramp fixtures and constantly performing the same tricks. It might be a plus, then, that you'll only need about an hour to finish the 22 race and freestyle events in the championship mode. It will also take roughly another hour to complete the challenges that unlock once you take the gold. Of course, paying full price to bring home two hours of play time seems silly. There are also three Surf's Up-themed puzzle minigames to kill time with, but they're too plain to warrant more than a quick look-see.     Unless you're buying the game to keep a small child occupied for a few hours, you should probably avoid the GBA version of Surf's Up. It's just too meager to be taken seriously.  "
1832,Hack 'n' Slash,6.0,1,"Doom, or turning on Big Head Mode in GoldenEye 007's actual menu of cheats, are long gone. The games today which do support cheats, however, often require you to enter them through some kind of ""developer mode"" or ""debug mode"". For PC games, this is commonly accomplished by pressing the tilde key to type codes directly into a command prompt, or by editing text files within the game's installation directory to change values or unlock new options. The console game equivalent would be akin to using a Game Genie or modded console to edit parts of the game itself, thereby allowing you to start with infinite lives, every item unlocked, or to access parts of the game that you as a player were never meant to see. Hack 'n' Slash is a game that is predicated upon your manipulation of such a developer mode being one of the primary mechanics. From its character designs, dialogue and inventory system, it's clear the game is an homage to The Legend of Zelda. You, a character who looks like Link, must stop an evil wizard, who looks like Ganondorf, from using this developer mode to ruin the world. Hack 'n' Slash also follows the Zelda series' gameplay formula to a T--but instead of acquiring new items to solve puzzles and explore the world with, you unlock new aspects of the game's developer mode to experiment with. You can change the speed of the day/night cycle, make a character forget that they've already given you an extra heart piece, and even see the invisible walls that define the game's traversable boundaries. The protagonist's sword isn't a traditional weapon--it has connectors on the end, like a USB stick. Hitting something with the sword doesn't deal damage. Instead, it plugs you into that object, such as a rock or an enemy creature, and allows you to manipulate its variables--programming-speak for the aspects that define how an in-game object behaves. You can change how much health it has, which characters it will attack, what its movement pattern is, and a host of other values unique to each particular object. It is within this unique context that you spend the first few hours of the game solving puzzles that will be familiar to players of any Zelda game--such as pushing blocks, or finding a way past a character who blocks a passage--but in new, fun ways. After those few hours, you acquire items that allow much deeper access to the game's code than a typical developer mode does. These items allow for what amounts to an in-game method for editing raw text files in the game's installation directory. One puzzle required me to find a way past a prison warden, who would not let me advance because my name was on a wanted list. I had to use an item to find the place in the game's memory where the variable that contained my name was stored, then use another item to change that name, so that when the warden checked that variable, it would make him think I was someone else. Getting to the realisation that such a series of steps was required to solve this puzzle was an exercise in frustration. Hack 'n' Slash lets you manipulate a wide breadth of elements that typically remain behind the scenes, yet the solution for each of these later puzzles is esoteric. I possess basic hobbyist programming knowledge--I know my way around a for loop and a switch statement--but it's not enough to fully understand the idiosyncrasies of Hack 'n' Slash's self-awareness. It's difficult to determine whether you're even on the right track when attempting these puzzles, because the information conveyed in the game's developer mode is completely abstract; even the text is rendered in nonsensical glyphs. You eventually find a Rosetta Stone-like item to convert those glyphs into English, which makes these advanced puzzles slightly easier to follow. However, entirely new kinds of puzzles are then introduced which construct visual representations of the mathematical flow of code and allow you to manipulate its numerical values. My brain is simply not tuned to tackle purely mathematical problems, and the visual manifestations of them aren't clear enough to provide people like me a more familiar starting point. I felt like I was taking a maths exam that I hadn't studied for. In the process of attempting to solve these puzzles, it's actually possible to break the game, from within the game--which is why one of the first items you receive is an orb that resets and reloads the current room. Once you have actually solved these puzzles, it becomes apparent how fiendishly clever Hack 'n' Slash actually is. The game derives a self-referential humour not through dialogue alone, but by gradually pulling back the curtain on the way games actually function. There's a fierce intelligence behind the way in takes the well-trodden Zelda formula and framing the puzzles as cheeky explorations of pure game logic. But the game assumes so much knowledge that, if you're not familiar with making games yourself, you may find each joke is lost on you whilst solving its associated puzzle, and is only funny in retrospect after its completion. Hack 'n' Slash, then, is a game made by game developers, for game developers, featuring humour that only game developers are likely to fully appreciate.  "
1935,Dead Rising 3,7.0,2,"   The way it moves you briskly from one challenge to the next is one of Super Arcade Dead Rising 3's strengths, as each individual task doesn't stand tall on its own. While the basic act of killing zombies (whether with weapons or in vehicles) in Dead Rising 3 is as fun as it ever was, the game is great about giving you different goals to accomplish, usually in rapid-fire succession. You may be asked to kill 100 zombies, yes, but then you are immediately sent to destroy specific items around town before you need to escape the area altogether--all as a timer ticks down, encouraging you to hurry. With skill, you can finish a list of tasks within a few minutes before moving onto the next round of challenges.  Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix's main draw isn't the slaughter of the undead; it's the zaniness surrounding it. The second you jump into the DLC, accessible from Dead Rising 3's main menu, its arcade influence is front and center. You're greeted with an old-school memory check screen, a joke about those old ""Winners Don't Use Drugs"" PSAs (fitting in with Dead Rising 3's canon, this one reads ""Winners Get Chipped""), and then Capcom's classic logo jingle, right before a remix of the old Street Fighter II menu music starts up. It's clear that Capcom aims to tug at the nostalgic heartstrings of its old fans, and frankly, it works. At just about every point possible, the developer shoves something in your face and says, ""Hey, remember this old game we made? What about this one?"" These references are old enough that they don't feel like advertising (there are no references to the likes of Dragon's Dogma or Monster Hunter) and instead evoke the feeling you might get when flipping through an old video game magazine and looking back at the biggest hits of the 90s. Whether it's Frank West dressed up as Mike Haggar or a billboard for Mega Man X4, you see signs of Capcom's history everywhere. Rival Schools or Power Stone, or when you turn into Tofu (a particularly obscure Resident Evil 2 reference), it all seems to come from a place of genuine appreciation. Dino Crisis, it feels more like you're playing as Regina herself, especially when her special move involves a pterodactyl that swoops in to attack the enemies in front of her. The result of all of this is an homage to classic Capcom. When developers cash in on its audience's nostalgia, they often do so through half-measures such as classic costumes and other trinkets that have little to no bearing on actual gameplay. Instead of taking that route, the developers of Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix have created something unique and heartfelt, and ultimately much more entertaining. The entertainment has its limits, though. Nostalgia can take you only so far, after all. The game is obviously intended for co-op players and is most enjoyable when played with friends or even strangers, and you can blaze through the game's four districts in no time at all, whether you're playing alone or not. The replay value comes in unlocking all of the game's 20 characters, which requires replaying levels many times over with different characters, as well as hunting down arcade cabinets hidden throughout each district. If you don't have allies to do this with, you might find the experience a slog, and whether it was due to technological inferiority or the DLC's unpopularity, I often had difficulty finding strangers to play with. Darkstalkers is exciting to you, then Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix is a blast."
2995,Bleach: Soul Resurreccion,6.0,1,"  Who is Ichigo Kurosaki? Why is Rukia Kuchiki doomed to die? Is Hueco Mundo a person, place, or thing? If you can answer these questions, then you have a good chance of following the action in Bleach: Soul Resurreccion. The disjointed Story mode in this licensed beat-'em-up makes no effort to welcome newcomers, and even dedicated fans might be surprised at the episodes this game picks and chooses from the popular manga and anime property. The cast list is big, and the visuals are crisp and colorful, making for some satisfyingly flashy moments. Yet these moments are the exception to the rule, as the bulk of Soul Resurreccion consists of simplistic and repetitive combat against uninteresting foes. The game quickly settles into a rut that it never emerges from, squandering the worthy source material with its dull action.         Regardless of how nasty they look, most enemies can be beaten with repeated combo attacks that you can execute by tapping the square button. Pressure attacks (the triangle and circle buttons) drain some of your spiritual pressure gauge but pack a big punch and can be very helpful for cutting down groups of enemies at once. They look flashy too, but the biggest visual treat in your arsenal (and also the most powerful attack) is your ignition attack. This bad boy can be unleashed only when you've filled the ignition gauge and powered yourself up by tapping L2, but it does serious damage against minions and bosses alike. This modest repertoire changes from character to character, and it is interesting to see what kind of damage each one can do.         Leveled-up characters come in handy in Mission mode, where you can choose any unlocked character and tackle stand-alone episodes. These missions are generally more difficult than those in Story mode, but aside from the occasional restriction (for example, no jumping) or time limit, Mission mode features the same bland environments and stylish-yet-stupid minions. Once you beat 11 of the 28 missions, you unlock Soul Attack mode. Here you play familiar levels and fight familiar foes, only this time your soul point total is posted to online leaderboards where you can check out the competition.      "
3501,N.O.V.A. - Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance,9.0,2,"           Better still, N.O.V.A.'s excellent multiplayer solves all of Modern Combat's issues. Matches are easy to enter and load stably and reliably. The game has five multiplayer maps that come in all shapes and sizes. There's a good variety of terrain between them, and each one requires a different strategy for success. N.O.V.A.'s multiplayer is limited to free-for-all Deathmatch for up to four players (with no team modes), but it still offers a great experience. Each map has health packs, weapons, and various power-ups that appear in various places. Although some of the weapons (like the plasma rifle and the sniper rifle) may take a bit of getting used to, there's a good variety of different guns. Annoyingly, each time a multiplayer match ends, you're booted out of the Gameloft Live service. To keep playing, you have to sign in again and find a new match. In addition, there's no real persistency to your multiplayer profile (you don't have a character that advances in levels of skills, like in other games), but even so, N.O.V.A.'s multiplayer is still a lot of fun.

2993,"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team",6.0,1,"         You play as one of four classes, each of which has its own special move. The librarian has an area-of-effect psychic shockwave, for instance, while the techmarine places a turret that helps gun down enemies for a short time. Some classes, like the huge-gun-wielding sternguard veteran, are better equipped for ranged combat, while others, like the vanguard veteran, carry a smaller gun and a melee weapon. But this variety doesn't add much to the game since the melee combat is as simple as the gunplay; you just tap X to attack. As you play, you unlock new weapons for each class (like a fearsome-looking lightning claw for the vanguard veteran), as well as perks that can be applied to any class, such as increased health, greater melee damage, or longer-lasting power-up benefits. These unlocks are a nice reward for your progress, and they come at a rapid pace, so you never have far to go to unlock the next one. But they don't make the gameplay any more interesting, and once you're tired of mowing down Orks, the prospect of increasing your health perk from +10 percent to +15 percent isn't a compelling enough reason to slog through another mission.       Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Fans of the grim Warhammer 40K universe looking to get in some Ork killing in advance of Space Marine's release, or those who remember the good-old days of arcade dual-stick shooters and are longing for some Smash TV-style fun, may be able to overlook Kill Team's shortcomings and get some enjoyment out of it. But there's no shortage of dual-stick shooters on PlayStation Network, and plenty of them are better than this one.   "
3199,Pokemon Black/White Version,8.0,2,"     Not messing with tradition, Pokemon White begins with you being summoned to the lab of a local Pokemon professor, who this time is named Juniper. She asks you and your two friends--Cheran and Bianca--to help with her research by becoming Pokemon trainers and cataloguing the many species of Pokemon for listing in the Pokedex. She also gives you one of three Pokemon to take on your journey: Snivy the grass snake, Tepig the fire pig, or Oshawott the sea otter. Pokemon in hand, you're free to explore the Unova region, interacting with the eccentric inhabitants of its towns and cities, as well as members of Team Plasma, whose cartoonish villainy forms the basis of the story. Deviating from the cozy stories of previous installments, the narrative takes a slightly darker turn, touching on the morality of keeping Pokemon. Should they be incarcerated in Pokeballs? Is it right to battle them? Should they be freed? Sadly, these elements aren't deeply explored, with many of the questions simply glossed over--a missed opportunity to give the game a more mature edge.            "
4053,18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker,5.0,1,"Since recently obtaining the publishing rights to several of Sega's first-party Dreamcast titles, Acclaim has made a little cottage industry out of quickly porting games such as Crazy Taxi and Ecco the Dolphin to more modern consoles such as the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube. Without exception, these ports have been without any bells or whistles, providing an experience that is on par with, if not slightly less engaging than, the original Dreamcast games. The GameCube version of 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker is no exception to this trend. Now, a game that was less than impressive on the Dreamcast is even less so when presented on the technically superior GameCube. With its roots firmly planted in its arcade origin, the gameplay modes in 18 Wheeler are all incredibly straightforward. In the arcade mode, you'll carry your payload from one city to another, all the while contending with an ornery rival trucker named Al and a limited amount of time, which you can extend by ramming specific vehicles off the road. You can also gain extra speed by using other trucks as a windbreak and slipstreaming behind them. This mode requires some precision driving, as even the most minor of driving mistakes can keep you from making it to the next checkpoint before time runs out. The driving abilities of the rival trucker are pretty suspect, as he will constantly speed up and slow down to maintain a similar pace to your own. The parking mode is exactly what it sounds like: You take your truck through a series of tight turns before parking your truck in a designated area--and before time runs out. Score attack challenges you to run three laps around a circular track to score points, which is done by plowing through designated ""bonus"" cars, beating your rival trucker to the finish line, and keeping other vehicles from running into your cargo. Finally, the versus mode pits players against each other in a straightforward race, albeit with trucks. These different gameplay modes are only moderately entertaining, but they're brought down by 18 Wheeler's predictably slow, plodding pace. The feeling of actually driving a big rig is conveyed reasonably well--the problem is that big rigs are generally slow and hard to handle, which doesn't translate into a very fun experience at all. 18 Wheeler on the GameCube doesn't look any better than the PlayStation 2 version, which is to say it looks only slightly better than the Dreamcast version. The environments are sparsely populated with vegetation, the occasional truck stop, and very simple-looking vehicles. There's no slowdown to speak of, though the game's draw-in distance is distractingly close. The soundtrack consists of a vague, forgettable mix of country-western music and rock 'n' roll, though this is overpowered by the almost constant shouting of your dispatcher and your rival trucker. They like to talk a lot, but they don't have much to say, which means you'll likely hear the same grainy exclamations shouted several times in any given level. Considering the price tag of the average GameCube game and the limited play value of 18 Wheeler, it's impossible to recommend to anyone but the most die-hard big rig enthusiasts. Even if starting convoys and talking on a CB radio are your idea of good fun, you should definitely approach this one with caution."
3341,Shaun White Skateboarding,6.0,1,"     The tyrannical organization called The Ministry has removed all the color and soul from your beloved city. Ministry propaganda is everywhere, and the citizens wander about like mindless drones. Even worse? Shaun White is one of the few skilled enough to stand up to this regime, but he's been taken prisoner in one of the most elaborate constructs ever to house a menace to society. It's up to you and your helpers to free the minds of the populace and set Shaun loose. Is the plot kooky? Oh yes. Is it entertaining? Sometimes. There is some charm in the ridiculousness, mostly in the form of characters that guide you through the story mode. A squealing lady's man with long tresses and a gift for melodrama may come across as a caricature, but he's comical at least, as is an excitable skater who drops a few choice bits of profanity. (A few lines of dialogue may have you wondering how this game managed to skate by with a T rating.) The biggest problem with the story is that it doesn't go far enough. Sometimes it comes across as tongue-in-cheek camp; other times, it strikes a serious tone, as if trying to sell you on this ridiculous setup. Thus, it settles on a slightly uncomfortable middle ground that isn't realistic enough to inspire a connection to the world--or to Shaun, who functions only as an abstract plot device--or outrageous enough to wholeheartedly commit to its subject matter or visual style as fully as Jet Grind Radio, a game that did much more with a similar premise.     That middle-ground approach permeates all of Shaun White Skateboarding. To return color to this muted world, you do tricks to earn ""flow."" If you earn a proper amount of flow, your landings cause a wave of color to erupt from the ground below you. Ramps burst forth where there were none before, and that which was dull and gray takes on color. The brainwashed citizens snap out of their trance, riding skateboards of their own and crying out such inane lines as ""You're making a difference!"" and ""Shake it like a picture!"" (""You've got a nice long one!"" is a memorable if still not particularly good one of these."") That isn't to say the world becomes vibrant, exactly. The color-restoration effect is neat for a while, and there's joy to be had when you feel like your tricks are having a tangible effect on your surroundings. You might now vert skate where you couldn't before, and cool sculptures may even rise from the ground. But the colors aren't strong and the art isn't exaggerated, so increasing your influence is more like spreading a mild tint than splashing the city with vivid hues. Again, the game doesn't go far enough, failing to fully embrace its style and seeming halfhearted as a result.       The game's other signature facet is shaping. You can extend green-hued rails and shape them as you skate, allowing you to reach higher areas or other points of interest. Skating onto a transparent vert ramp causes it to spring to life, and wide ribbons turn into impromptu streets. As you progress, these features evolve. Eventually, you can raise platforms upward or pull them down to reveal tunnels and even create rails out of thin air. Shaping edges and platforms is pretty neat in the first half of the game. It takes a bit of time to get used to the controls when shaping; the left analog stick, normally used for navigation, controls the direction of the rail once you've begun shaping, so you have to make a mental adjustment, lest you veer off in a direction that you didn't intend. Once you get used to this quirk, shaping is a pleasant addendum to the skating, helping you to reach high areas for completing objectives and finding icons that unlock new clothing choices, as well as other odds and ends.    Tony Hawk games or as focused on authenticity as the Skate series. But it feels fine when it gives you the freedom to make your own fun, having you flick the analog sticks to perform your various skills, more of which can be purchased via the in-game skate shop. Vert skating is particularly enjoyable, and there are multiple deep crevasses that give you ample opportunity to catch air. Some areas are a joy to navigate, such as an amusement park featuring a derelict roller coaster and a downtown area featuring theaters and towering billboards. These regions are packed with benches to grind and ramps to exploit. Later portions send you to less-interesting places with fewer chances to get your groove on, like large control rooms and confining rooftops.        This change in scenery comes with a change in attitude. About halfway through, Shaun White Skateboarding stops being a skating game and becomes a tedious platformer. You must complete objectives (take out these flow-zapping pylons, destroy these cameras) by using shaping rails and platforms in very specific ways. Suddenly, the pace grinds to a halt, and you spend more time figuring out how to get to your destination and manipulating ramps than you do performing tricks or transforming the world. More problematic is that it isn't that fun to figure out which rails need to be shaped in what ways to complete an objective. The more specific an objective is, the less cooperative the controls are; rails pull you on to them even if you don't want to grind them, and long grinds make constantly having to adjust your balance an annoyance. (Falling from on high during a timed mission is one of the game's most frustrating occurrences.) For several hours, you spend precious little time doing the fun stuff (tricking and verting) and far too much time figuring out how to get from point A to point B. You also spend way too much time performing a hacking minigame, which involves moving a marble past various obstacles until you reach the destination, a la Marble Madness. Not only does the hacking feel out of place, but the controls are too slippery for it to be all that agreeable.      You may have had hopes that multiplayer would bail out the disappointing single-player experience, but it doesn't significantly improve Shaun White Skateboarding's value. The modes are solid and lag-free, having players compete for points by accumulating flow and shaping objects, either online or in split-screen. Unfortunately, it's incredibly difficult to find just one other person online, let alone seven others for full team battles. What's left is a mildly enjoyable skateboarding game and a monotonous puzzle platformer, an uncomfortable mixture of game philosophies delivered in a package unwilling to commit to the features that might have helped it excel.     "
3983,The Hustle: Detroit Streets,5.0,1,"  Last October, Activision Value released The Hustle: Detroit Streets for the PlayStation Portable. As the first pool game available for the system, the game's moderate level of success was not because of its tight gameplay mechanics, great production values, or gritty storyline, but simply because it was the only pool game available for the system. Now, for some reason unbeknownst to the logical-minded consumer, The Hustle is now available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in relatively unaltered form. A few minor fixes here and there make the pacing of the game less irritating than it was on the PSP, but when you consider the number of glaring things the developers didn't fix when making the transition, and the fact that The Hustle is far from the only pool title available on either console, The Hustle starts looking a lot less appealing than it did just six months ago.          When you first boot up The Hustle, you quickly toss together a basic profile and character to represent yourself. There's some backstory here about your character's rise and fall from grace, but it's all meaningless filler. It's just an excuse to put you on track to play a lot of pool against a lot of seedy characters. You don't have to work especially hard to make that happen. Just plop yourself down in the first available pool hall and start challenging and accepting challenges from the roustabouts that occupy the building. You start out with only a few available challengers, and as you win more money and earn more respect (which is actually measured via a numbered percentage), more opportunities will open up.     It'll take a long time for that to happen, however. While you do eventually move on and periodically go up against some boss opponents, it's likely that most people will get a distinct sense of going nowhere fast for the first hour or two of play. You'll challenge the same guys over and over and over again, play a lot of the same pool games to boot, and you'll wonder where the hell this is all going. A more obvious way of measuring your progress would have been greatly helpful to counteract this feeling. It's also of note that The Hustle is a tough game to just pick up and play. There isn't really a quick-play option to speak of. You can jump into the story mode and play friendly matches against some opponents for no cash, but even there the number of games you can actually play is limited. There are a ton of different pool games and trick shots buried within the game, but it takes a painfully long time to actually be able to play any of them whenever you like.     The saving grace here is the pool itself, which is handled reasonably well. At first glance, the control scheme seems woefully awkward, but after a few plays, it becomes second nature. Instead of doing the standard console pool mechanic of making the analog stick directly emulate the movement of the stick for a shot (you can do that here, but the analog stick shot sensitivity, despite not being as awful as it was on the PSP, still feels mighty off), all you have to do is angle your shot with the left analog stick, then pull backward on the right analog stick to get a sense of how much power you want for the shot. Once you do, a meter will pop up on the screen. In it, an arrow icon will move up and down, and in the middle of the meter sits a white zone that represents an accurate shot. You want to try to stop the arrow in the white zone, which shrinks in size depending on how hard the shot is. It's tricky, but it works. If you do it right, the game will cut to a quick scene of your character lining up his or her shot, and then taking it. Despite it taking the action out of your hands, you still feel like you pulled it off yourself.     At times, The Hustle is too easy of a game. There is a constant aim guide available that shows the track of the ball you're aiming for, as well as the track the cue ball will inevitably follow. The readings aren't always precise, but most times they give you a very accurate understanding of where the balls are going to go. Inherently that's OK, but it makes a lot of the other options, like putting English on the ball and setting cue elevation, mostly unnecessary. Occasionally a shot will pop up that requires one of these things, but most times all you need to do is find the right angle and knock it in. The simplicity isn't necessarily a terrible thing, but if you're looking for a fully accurate and challenging pool simulation, this isn't it.        On the PSP, the cutscenes that played between shots were a big headache, mainly because the load times were simply atrocious and entirely too frequent. The load times are basically gone in the console versions, although some new issues present themselves. For one, it's pretty apparent that the game's visual assets were never intended to go to this high a resolution. The character models for the main pool players are merely blocky and ugly (and frequently clip right through one another while taking shots), but the crowd graphics are quite possibly the most hysterically awful crowd visuals ever. They're just 2D character cutouts that have one point of articulation--a detached torso that swings back and forth like it's on some kind of horrible pendulum. On the PSP's smaller screen, details like this just weren't obvious. Here, they're in your face and impossible to ignore. It's amazing, but The Hustle has gone from a good-looking handheld game to a poor-looking console game in practically no time at all. There's still some atmospheric quality to the game, mind you. It does a decent job of presenting a seedy, grimy pool hall, and some of the background chatter (such as the guy who just yells, ""This is bull****!"" at frequent intervals) is hilarious. There's also plenty of cheesy bar-band music to go around. But while all these things lend themselves toward the game's chosen style, it doesn't necessarily make them good.     The one thing The Hustle: Detroit Streets offers on consoles that it did not on the PSP is online play. You and an opponent can go online on either system and duke it out with the usual assortment of pool games--at least, in theory you can. The hard part isn't getting the game online, but actually finding someone to play against. We spent multiple days looking for opponents, and never found anyone on either system. That probably doesn't bode well for the long-term multiplayer experience.     While The Hustle was already kind of a tough sell on the PSP, given its multiple caveats, it's near impossible to recommend the game as it appears on the PS2 and Xbox. This isn't some slickly written, The Color of Money-esque tale of stylish pool hustling, nor is it a particularly detailed or compelling game of pool. It was more compelling on the PSP since no one else had even made an attempt to represent the game on the system up to that point, but with dozens of different pool games available for consoles at a near-universal budget price, many of which are vastly superior in terms of gameplay quality, The Hustle: Detroit Streets becomes thoroughly unnecessary.    "
4194,Disney Bolt,4.0,0,"  Bolt is the ideal canine companion: He's loyal, intelligent, obedient, and can shoot lasers from his eyes. Unfortunately, this superdog doesn't get the superstar treatment that he deserves on the Nintendo DS. The shallow plot makes it hard to care about the story's outcome and the repetitive gameplay sucks all the substance out of the action. It's a shame that Bolt doesn't use his talents more, because this pound puppy is incredibly cute. However, not even his laser beam vision can solder these crummy parts into something worth playing.        It's probably for the best that Bolt on the DS doesn't follow the movie's storyline. In the movie, Bolt doesn't actually have superpowers; he's merely an actor on a television show. Instead, the DS game is one of the action-packed episodes in which Penny, Bolt's owner, must save her father from the sinister, green-eyed Calico. You'll travel to five exotic locations, taking out along the way what seems like an army of cloned henchmen, until your final showdown with Calico. The story is told with still images and minimal dialogue, none of which is voice acted. These sequences feel more like a PowerPoint presentation whose sole purpose is to break up the monotonous gameplay.     Through the game's 30 missions, you'll rotate between playing as Penny and Bolt, neither of whom is particularly exciting. Penny swings her wheel bar, a device that also lets her scale walls and use a zip line, and Bolt bashes enemies with his forehead. Using the X and Y buttons, you can attack and do various combos, but you'll never need to know more than one combo. Energy atoms can be collected by breaking crates and by fighting the limited assortment of bad guys. Atoms are so plentiful, you'll max out your four-legged friend's abilities well before the ending credits. The ability to customize and enhance your characters is a great feature, except once you're capped out, you have no reason to fight or explore anymore.     Though the majority of the gameplay is button-mashing, you do spend time with some brief minigames. The brave young Penny has the ability to hack computers, represented by a quick but mildly entertaining minigame in which you draw lines to connect symbols to match the pattern in the top screen. Unfortunately, this is the most exciting action Penny has in her repertoire. She's a clever girl, but walking from one end of the map to the other, clobbering enemies, and jumping over gaps gets old really fast. Bolt, on the other hand, is able to use his laser vision when the situation calls for it. An arrow pops up on the touch screen for you to trace. These are scripted moments, which is disappointing because it would have been nice to use this ability at your leisure to mow down an entire row of Calico's followers.      The biggest problem with Bolt is the camera, which zooms in much too close at the most inconvenient angle, making it difficult to see what's around you. It's not even worth using the L and R buttons to rotate the camera, because it not only doesn't pan far enough, it abruptly pauses the action as well. In light of the awkward camera, you'll often find that if you don't line up Bolt and Penny carefully, your attacks will miss their target completely. Bolt fares a bit better because he jumps in the air, which sometimes lets the camera back off enough for you to get a better view. The top screen can be switched to an overhead map on which you can view the enemy's location. This makes battles slightly less frustrating, but you have to hit select to switch to this screen several times in a level because the game automatically goes back to the mission display every time a brief cutscene occurs. It's annoying having to hit select to keep the map visible, given that it's the best way to scout enemies before they're on top of you. Even with these issues, you'll never find yourself in danger of losing. The game is so incredibly easy that you have to go out of your way to fail a mission.     The storyboards that detail Penny and Bolt's adventure are well drawn and able to convey some of the story's emotions. Other than the nicely drawn still art, Bolt's visuals in some areas are very bland, and the level designs aren't that creative, either. Whether you're in Russia or China, the environments may look different, but because you're doing the same thing over and over again, they all feel the same. The music will alter slightly, and it does a decent job of setting the mood, but there aren't any memorable melodies. There are no distinct sounds when you hit the generic enemies, which makes it difficult to know whether or not you've made contact.         As you progress through the game, you unlock a number of items (mainly outfits) that can be accessed via DGamer, Disney's social-networking service for its DS games. This may be worth it for those who play Disney DS games and want to expand their online wardrobe. There are a couple of multiplayer features, which include the hacking game that can be played against a friend, and you can also go through a small handful of missions together in the Battle Arena mode. Banding together as Bolt and Penny to take on Calico's henchmen is a good idea, but you can complete the levels within 15 minutes and there's no reason to want to do it again. Not to be forgotten is Rhino the hamster, who gets his share of the spotlight as the star of his own side game. With a setup similar to Super Monkey Ball, you tilt the level to roll the encapsulated Rhino to the finish line. But due to stiff controls and repetitious level design, this side game--like the main dish--feels like a missed opportunity.     Clumsy controls, lackluster story, and a bad camera make Bolt difficult to recommend. The game is limited in every aspect, which doesn't make it fun for very long; young gamers can find much better alternatives. The sweet, adorable, snow-white German shepherd is a great new addition to Disney's animated cast, but his talents are much better suited on the silver screen.  "
3025,Dead Block,4.0,0,"       The neat satisfaction of such skilled play, however, is doused by boredom. When things are going well, you are running a few feet at a time and then tapping the B button to destroy a piece of furniture (a barely animated visual disappointment) or alternately pulling the triggers to search an object (always the same lame junk-flinging slideshow). These repetitive actions take up the majority of your time, and you interrupt them only to reset a trap or reinforce a barricade. Both of these tasks occur automatically once you initiate them, but you can accelerate them by either holding a button or tapping a button when a sliding indicator reaches the target zone (or more accurately, slightly before it reaches the zone to compensate for input delay). You spend almost all your time in Dead Block smashing, searching, and setting traps, and all of these actions are boring. Even attempts to liven things up go awry, as illustrated by the poorly calibrated end-of-level minigame that plays like an insult to the memory of Guitar Hero.       If your plan gets fouled up, you soon find yourself beset by more zombies than your relatively weak melee attack (and constitution) can handle. You can attack zombies by tapping the right shoulder button, but you have to run in, hit one a few times, and then duck out before you get smacked, or else you won't survive long. It's all the excitement of smashing furniture with the extra fun of clumsily running back and forth in a cramped space! Using environmental hazards like jukeboxes (most nearby zombies dance themselves to death) and televisions (all nearby zombies are enthralled and stand motionless) can help you handle the hordes better, as can each character's smart bomb ability. These abilities stun or kill a certain number of zombies, and they can be upgraded by searching objects. There is an inherent satisfaction in clearing out a group of zombies with your abilities, but it also means you have more time to get the dull smash-search-set grind back on track.      The 10 levels of the campaign can also be played cooperatively with up to three local players, and having other humans on your team makes you much more efficient (the AI allies who intermittently join you on single-player levels only help out in limited ways). Unfortunately, the more efficient your team is, the clearer it becomes that Dead Block is shallow and repetitive to the core. The campy B-movie vibe and cartoon aesthetic aren't good enough to add much appeal, and the few clever ideas get lost in a sea of relentless button tapping. In an actual zombie apocalypse, Dead Block's simple zombie-clearing tactics and industrious fortification construction would be desirable, but in this video game zombie apocalypse, they're just dull.  "
4681,The Secrets of Atlantis,3.0,0,"  Few have ever gone broke ripping off classic movies and literature for adventure games, so it would seem like the developers at Atlantis Interactive Entertainment made a smart decision when they decided to clone Indiana Jones. The Secrets of Atlantis thoroughly mimics the exploits of the intrepid archaeologist, right down to the hero's choice of hats and a globe-spanning mystery that involves everyone's favorite sunken continent. Unfortunately, once you get beyond the window dressing, you're left with a pale imitation (really, really pale--think of Harrison Ford replaced by the kid who used to play Screech) that is burdened by clueless puzzles, as well as grade-Z pictures and sound.        About all this game has going for it is its period atmosphere. Just as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg patterned the Indiana Jones franchise on movie serials from the 1930s and '40s, Atlantis Interactive sets its adventure in 1937. Protagonist Howard Brooks may be an aeronautical engineer instead of an whip-wielding archaeologist, but he comes complete with a fedora and a mysterious medallion that just might unlock an ancient mystery. Sound familiar? The story that he finds himself entangled in cribs liberally from all three Indiana Jones movies. Brooks travels aboard the Hindenburg to exotic ports of call, such as Macao and Baghdad. He gets involved with a feisty dame and finds out that his father once searched for Atlantis as well. Even the travel sequences between levels are illustrated by lines snaking across maps. All the game needs to complete its thievery is a cameo appearance by Short Round or Sallah.     Despite this stunning display of unoriginality, enough is stolen from Doctor Jones to lay the groundwork for an exciting game. But everything here is awful, aside from the borrowed bare bones of the plot. The look and sound seem as old as the ancient civilization that you're seeking. Gameplay is based on stutter-step Myst mechanics where you click to move and then swivel around looking at your surroundings, so you know that this isn't going to be a cutting-edge production.      Still, you've got to go back a while to find an adventure with such terrible visuals and sound. Settings are blurry and devoid of visual flourishes beyond period touches, such as posters of old magazine covers in New York or a surreal city in the clouds in India. Characters move as stiffly as zombies; they're as pale and unreal looking as zombies too. All actions are shown in tiny Bink video boxes, and audio is an utter mess. Pounding car-chase tunes illustrate all the Empire State Building sequences even when you're just strolling down an office corridor, and Macao is given music that typically accompanies General Tso's chicken. Voice acting is the aural equivalent of being poked with a stick, especially when accents are used. Sound is also buggy, with lots of snap, crackle, and pop that gets particularly bad during dialogue.     Puzzles blend the familiar with the idiotic. Most of the item-oriented challenges aren't set up properly through dialogue or clues. Generally, you get a reasonable idea of what's going on from a conversation or two but no direction on how to accomplish goals. So you're stuck patrolling rooms and hallways, looking for finicky hot spots. Items are also tough to spot. They're tiny and blended in so well with inaccessible backdrop scenery that it's impossible to figure out what you can pick up without rolling the cursor over the entire screen. There often isn't any rhyme or reason to object placement either. For example, a knife that you need in India is dropped apropos of nothing in the Hindenburg's engine room. You have no reason to suspect that the knife is there, no reason to think that you even need such an implement nor any reason to go anywhere near the engine room, but you've got to have it or you'll get stuck in under 10 minutes.         Set-piece puzzles are handled a little better. In addition to the old-school item hunts, Secrets of Atlantis includes a number of brainteasers involving interesting gadgets. Most are just elaborate combination locks that can be opened by plugging in the codes discovered on scraps of paper and the like, although there are also some logic puzzles. You slide panels to complete a Chinese mosaic, place jewels to direct laser beams, cut and paint stones to restore an ancient Babylonian fresco, and even play Sudoku on the inside lid of a sarcophagus. All of these contests provide some much-needed atmosphere, although they don't compensate for the item-collecting busywork. Nor do they compensate for the horror-show graphics and sound.     If Indy had encountered nonsense like this during one of his escapades, he'd have let the Nazis win. Secrets of Atlantis is best left in a watery grave.  "
4372,March of the Penguins,4.0,0,"  Just as the title suggests, the video game rendition of March of the Penguins is based on the award-winning film documentary about emperor penguins. In the game, you help the tuxedo-colored birds migrate inland, forage for food, and care for their young by solving puzzles and navigating mazes set in the harsh Antarctic wasteland. It may seem silly that a company would make a video game out of a documentary, but the puzzles and subject matter actually mesh together fine. However, what isn't fine is that although the game is clearly aimed at younger players, the majority of puzzles require an adult-sized intellect to solve. Anyone that's still in elementary school will probably shut the game off in frustration long before finishing the first chapter. Conversely, anybody with two digits in their age should be able to work through each of the game's 12 puzzles, but they'll likely find no joy in doing so, because the graphics, audio, and overall presentation are geared toward simpler tastes and fall way behind the curve compared to most of the other games that are available for Nintendo's handheld systems.        Half of the game's dozen chapters are reminiscent of the classic puzzle game Lemmings. The penguins, as they are prone to do, have decided to march from one end of the level to the other. It's your job to plant objects along their path that will help the cute birds navigate the various hills and make it to the end without falling into the chilly waters below. Steps let them climb, tents let them bounce really high, snowballs cushion their fall, and so forth. In all, there are eight different objects that you can drag and drop onto the penguins' path. You must have solid spatial-reasoning skills to figure out the right sequence of objects, as well as be able to make decisions quickly, since the penguins are constantly waddling toward their perceived goal. Because this is an E-rated game, they don't die if they fall into the water. They simply reappear at the beginning of the level. However, the trade-off is that you only have a limited amount of time to finish the level. If you have a mishap near the end of the level, there usually won't be enough time left over for any stragglers to rejoin the main group. Factoring in trial and error, it can easily take 30 minutes or more to figure out each Lemmings-style chapter.     The other six chapters are simpler maze-navigation tasks based on key scenes from the film. In one, you have to guide a male penguin through a gauntlet of other penguins while keeping hold of a slippery egg. In another, you have to dive into the water and catch fish while avoiding predators. Compared to the Lemmings-style puzzles, these maze chapters are ridiculously easy.     Some might enjoy the challenge posed by the Lemmings chapters, if only there were any payoff for doing so. Six puzzles is nowhere near enough, considering the typical puzzle game has dozens upon dozens of puzzles. Furthermore, the presentation is much too simple to captivate anyone that has other games at their disposal. The backgrounds are stark and lack color or animation. The penguins are cute and have a smooth waddle, but they're tiny and don't do much except flap and shuffle. It doesn't help that the accompanying audio consists of a few instrumental tunes that loop constantly, along with some basic sound effects that are meant to be footsteps and penguin squawks. Between levels, beautiful photographic stills from the film are shown, along with factoids about the emperor-penguin migration.        The game is available for both the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS. Both versions have the same levels, graphics, and audio. The DS version is easier to play, however, because you can use the stylus to instantly drag and drop objects. The map that's always visible on the upper screen also comes in handy, as does the automatic save feature. By contrast, the GBA game doesn't have a map and makes players write down passwords to maintain progress. Of course, the GBA game does cost a few dollars less.     Not that many people will or should consider buying either version of March of the Penguins. The Lemmings-style puzzles are much too difficult for younger players, while older players will be turned off by how bland and short-lived the overall product is. The silly thing isn't that they made a video game out of a documentary film. The silly thing is that they made it too difficult for one audience and too insubstantial for the other.    "
2180,WRC 4: FIA World Rally Championship,6.0,1,"   Dirt, but it's still accessible thanks to the typical suite of optional assists, such as braking. Dirt, but it's still accessible thanks to the typical suite of optional assists, such as braking. The biggest control differences from last year are noticeable only if you have a steering wheel. WRC 4's wheel support is a significant improvement over wheel support in the previous installments, with full support for 900-degree wheels and H-pattern shifters, offering a much more authentic experience if you're equipped to take advantage of it. If you're a steering wheel user, this is a game that you absolutely should check out. Other areas of the driving experience have not been updated in any meaningful way. The co-driver voice is exactly the same monotonous one that has been featured throughout the series, and the cars still don't feel noticeably different in snow or rain. There's definitely a little more oversteer in adverse weather conditions, but it's nowhere near as much of a challenge as in some other racing games. Most of Milestone's efforts have gone into improving the stages that host the rallies. All of the countries and special stages have undergone an extensive graphical overhaul. Every single object and surface has been retextured and altered to bring the series' graphics up to date. There are more fans and trackside objects, creating a much better atmosphere and sense of place. The presentation still doesn't match up to the high standards of other racing games, but it's not quite as dated as before. In particular, the lighting has improved dramatically, with different times of day looking significantly different, creating a variety of visibility challenges. The game also features cutscenes that use footage of the real WRC, while some spectacularly over-the-top orchestral music gives each event the feeling of a big occasion and does a surprisingly good job of pumping you up before the start of a stage. As well as completely reworking the graphics for returning stages, Milestone has thrown out some of the less enjoyable road layouts from previous WRC games and replaced them with completely new configurations. These new routes are much narrower than before, creating a more authentic feeling of the danger faced by real rally drivers and the bravery and skill needed to overcome it. They are also much more challenging than before, but most of the new rallies are constantly winding one way and then the other, giving you very little opportunity to enjoy these powerful cars at high speed. There are plenty of routes where you never need to go above fourth gear in your six-speed gearbox. Thankfully, Rally Finland and other courses with a reputation for speed in real life are not quite so slow, so there is some respite to be had from the constant hairpins that dominate the rest of the game. When you're done competing against the clock in single-player (WRC 4 still doesn't have AI cars on the stages at the same time as you), you can take your off-road antics online. WRC's multiplayer offering has always been basic, and that continues here, with a simple lobby system for ranked and unranked matches, which can be single stages, a full rally, or a longer championship. Players race on the same stage, at the same time, without staggered starts, so you see ghosts on the course rather than having the opportunity to catch and pass cars which left the gate a few moments before you. The offline multiplayer is similarly basic and only features the returning hot-seat gameplay where you take it in turns to set times on a stage. WRC 4 continues Milestone's trend of satisfying but unremarkable rally games. Some key areas have clearly been worked on, but the core experience still lags behind Dirt when it comes to capturing the pure excitement of off-road racing, and Career mode is nothing that we haven't seen dozens of times in other racing games. There simply isn't enough originality. If you own a steering wheel, the handling has enough depth to provide some great entertainment, but the tweaked courses aren't enough of a step forward for the franchise."
576,SuperMash,3.0,0,"It's easy to think of how some of your favorite video game genres might fit together. In the space of just pure imagination, it’s possible to completely deconstruct familiar tropes and wildly throw them against a wall to see what sticks, challenging established norms without consequence. It’s this sort of unhinged creativity that makes Supermash initially hard to ignore. By making it easy to choose two genres and mash them together with randomly determined results, Supermash seems to promise a near endless supply of retro concoctions. But instead of delicately blended results, the games that Supermash does spit out lack any identity, while feeling too similar to one another when they do work and downright frustrating when borderline broken.The core conceit of Supermash is the ability to create new games from templates of genres. The genres on offer are varied, ranging from a classic NES action adventure in the vein of The Legend of Zelda to the sneaky steps of a Metal Gear-inspired stealth game. Each genre template plucks a core idea from its inspirations and uses that as the core mechanic for your eventual combinations. For example, a JRPG will lend turn-based combat to any game it’s matched with, while a shoot-'em-up will introduce vertically scrolling terrains to whatever other genre you choose to pair with it.Supermash is incredibly easy to get going--pick two genres, decide on a desired game length and difficulty, and use mostly single-use collectible cards to make small cosmetic and gameplay changes to the initial result. The rest is handled by Supermash’s procedural generation, which doesn’t always do the best job of masking the limited templates it's clearly working with. Within an hour, I was recognizing the same layouts in both stealth and action adventure mashes, and even routinely seeing the same visual palates used to dress them up in. Seeing the strings behind the puppetry would’ve been disappointing but forgivable, though, if the games themselves were any fun to play.Most of the creations lack any substantial differences between them. Whether you’re playing a shrunken-down Zelda-like dungeon or jumping through a Mario-inspired platformer, you’re generally doing one of three things: finding a specific character, retrieving a specific item, or killing a certain number of a specific enemy, all within a short timeframe. These don’t change with the genres you’re putting together, which often makes genres meant to be less linear pointless. Genres like JRPGs or metroidvanias are much more than just their styles of combat or collectible upgrades, but Supermash never gives you levels or goals that reflect this. And even when the objectives do coalesce with the main genre influence, they’re just unsatisfying to play. Platforming feels floaty and imprecise, dungeon crawling becomes nothing more than a repetitive checklist, and shoot-'em-ups never capture the exhilaration of their inspirations.Randomly assigned modifiers called ""glitches"" can somewhat differentiate one mash from the next, but more often than not, they result in more game-breaking issues. A glitch can, for example, spawn a new enemy every time you attack, or conversely heal you every time you take damage. These serve to either eliminate any challenge or increase it to frustrating levels, regardless of the difficulty setting you assign prior to making the game. Others are more frustrating, though. I had a glitch that moved me in a random direction for a few seconds after each attack, which made simple movement a chore. It forced me to just forgo combat entirely while navigating a dungeon, further restricting the already limited actions I had. There’s no way to turn these randomly assigned glitches off either, so when you’re dealt a bad hand, you just have to restart and hope for a better result next time.That isn’t to say there aren’t some combinations that aren’t at least amusing. Playing a 2D stealth game with the turn-based combat of classic Final Fantasy games doesn’t work mechanically (having to go into an action menu to perform a stealth kill is ridiculous), but it does remind you of how good each of the individual parts are in other games. But Supermash’s multitude of little games never come close to reaching the entertaining heights of the genres they attempt to recreate, which makes it difficult to want to test the abilities of its random generation further after your initial attempts.Encompassing all of this experimentation is a thin story about three friends trying to keep their video game retail store open, with the crew hoping to package and sell some of these new creations to spark some interest. Story objectives set some parameters for your next mashup, indicating what genres and modifiers to use, without really steering you towards any great outcomes. There’s an additional journal to work through with objectives tied to each genre you have at your disposal, each connecting small but throwaway stories within them.Progressing this journal is incredibly frustrating, though, since the items required for completion are populated into your generated levels at random. You’re forced to repeatedly mash together the same genres in the hopes of finally getting one that has what you need, which only serves to expose the repetitive nature of them even faster. Each chapter culminates with a boss fight specific to the genre you’re completing, and despite being some of the only handcrafted bits of retro action in Supermash, they fail to be any more exciting than the random contraptions you put together. Most are one-note and devoid of challenge, only requiring repetitive attacks and simple movements to overcome. They’re not worth the time you need to invest to unlock them.It’ll be rare for you to want to save any of the creations Supermash lets you construct, which is indicative of how shallow and unsatisfying they all are at their core. In a bid to try and do so many things right, Supermash forgets the fundamentals of all the genres it tries to encompass, while also overreaching by trying to make them all work in some way together. None of Supermash’s creations feel close to replicating the joy of their inspirations, and instead serve as reminders that there are far more focused and polished attempts at each individual one that will reward your time better. There’s no doubting the imaginative idea at Supermash’s core, but it ends up choking on its ambition."
1372,Ashes of the Singularity,4.0,0,"It plays like many of its peers: you build out a base, collect resources, and engage in combat. It's a basic framework that underpins everything from Starcraft to Rise of Nations. The core problem is there is little to appreciate beyond how busy Ashes of the Singularity's battles become. When it comes to forming a strategy, there are few opportunities to develop nuanced tactics.You have three main resources to manage--metal, radiactives, and turinium. The first two are for constructing ships, but if you collect enough turinium you win the game. Because turinium is necessary for victory, Ashes of the Singularity encourages hapless and aggressive rushing. Your starting area will only have a couple resource nodes, and you can't stockpile resources as you can in most other strategy games. So, playing cautiously isn't an option. You have to expand--and fast.This exacerbates some of Ashes of the Singularity's other problems. As I churned out endless streams of robotic warriors, I noticed that they all looked similar, especially when I pulled the camera all the way out and the battlefield melted together in the mélange of war machines. Pressing to gain more and more ground kept me from developing any familiarity with my units, which is unfortunate given you only have about a dozen unique types to work with. Each frigate looks indistinguishable from the last, making it hard to keep track of which units you have and which ones you still need.With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use.Maps are consistently dry and lack character. With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use. There are no towering mountains to hide your forces during an ambush, no rare or unique resources to exploit, nor any obstacles to slow down foes. Every unit and building works the same regardless of placement on the map, and as you build out a network of resource nodes, you'll see the same desolate brown textures again and again.You have the ability to organize your legions into ""armies,"" which are supposed to be super-charged control groups. And this works, but only to a point. Forming armies reduced the need to constantly micromanage units, allowing me to focus on the larger plan: pinching off enemy supplies, flanking with the brutality of my dreadnoughts, and dropping strategic weapons of mass destruction. But Ashes of the Singularity still left me with scant few options to conduct my campaign.It's hard not to draw comparisons to earlier massive-scope strategy games, namely Supreme Commander. The parallels between the two run deep and cover everything from their approach to resource collection to their emphasis on massive battles. But, despite being a decade old, Supreme Commander still wears the crown. Rather than rest on the spectacle of massive battles alone, it crucially wove finer pieces into its formula to make those bouts interesting.There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, Ashes of the singularity is ultimately shallow.Ashes of the Singularity doesn't have these flourishes; what you see is what you get. There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, is ultimately shallow. It's a wonder to see in action, but tedious to play. Scale should be a canvas for battles, not a replacement for a deep set of tools. Instead of providing an intricate network of systems to work with, Ashes of the Singularity cuts itself down, leaving only the most basic elements of the genre intact. You have a handful of units, three resources, and a basic goal. At no point can you leverage anything beyond those basic pieces in a meaningful way. Without more resources, nuanced mechanics, or a charming aesthetic to help carry the experience, Ashes of the Singularity struggles to hold your attention.As it stands, Ashes of the Singularity feels like little more than a tech demo of Stardock's new Oxide engine. At best, it demonstrates the power of multicore optimization and DirectX 12, being the latest game to push the limits of computing to render a massive number of moving parts in a burgeoning war machine. Even so, the game comes off as half-finished. There is a decent foundation, but Ashes fails to build on it in a satisfying way."
3043,Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony,8.0,2,"    charging a large energy ball. Its secondary fire releases this ball, which slowly moves forward and deals high damage. Bomb is an odd ship. It fires a lone string of bullets forward, which can be detonated with the secondary fire to create a small chain of explosions. No matter which ship you choose, you have three ways to play: keyboard, gamepad, and mouse. The first two work well, though the mouse takes some getting used to because you're not in direct control of your ship.      In lieu of having bombs or other special weapons, every ship in Jamestown has a vaunt gauge. You fill this gauge by collecting the golden nuts and bolts that spill out of defeated enemies. Once full, you can activate your vaunt, which has a variety of effects. The most obvious effect is that it projects a circular shield around your ship that absorbs all incoming fire and convents it into bonus points. Activating vaunt also starts a point multiplier that continues to build as you get kills while in this mode. Finally, it increases the damage output of your weapons, letting you plow through foes with impunity. The effects of the vaunt gauge are limited; once activated, the gauge begins to deplete. You can refill it by collecting additional nuts and bolts or choose to end it early. Ending it early creates a smaller shield around your ship for a brief time and cash in all of the points you've collected.        The vaunt is a wonderfully diverse tool that can be used offensively or defensively. It's a panic button for when you're under fire as well as your one-way ticket to the top of the leaderboards. But even with the power of the vaunt gauge, chances are you will get stuck in Jamestown now and again. At times like these, it's best to hit up ye olde shoppe and cash in some of the currency you've acquired at the end of each level. This currency unlocks new ships, challenge stages, and more. The different types of challenge stages--while tough--are another way in which the game teaches you new tricks. Survival stages, for instance, pit you against an overwhelming number of enemies and force you to nimbly manage your vaunt wisely if you want to survive. Together, all these challenge types serve as a form of high-intensity training. If you pass a few of them, suddenly the part you were stuck on won't seem so bad.     The true genius of Jamestown lies in how it manages difficulty. Instead of throwing you into the deep end, the game gradually builds you up through five difficulty levels. Four of these are available from the beginning, so if you want to jump straight to the penultimate difficulty, you can. Otherwise, normal mode is a great place to start. It provides plenty of challenge without burying you with bullets (that comes later). Even so, you still have to act quickly because your ship explodes after one hit. Thankfully, the game doesn't kick you straight to the game over screen. Jamestown grants you a few credits in case you need to limp your way across the finish line.     At certain intervals during the game's five-mission campaign, you're required to complete the previous stages on a specific difficulty before advancing. This tough love builds up your skills as a player, which you'll need by the end. With each successive level of difficulty, the game layers on additional bullets and enemies. When you finally reach the last stage, it's a beast. All of the skills you've learned thus far are tested, while a few new tricks are thrown in as well. Once you (finally) finish the campaign and return to that first stage on normal difficulty, it's satisfying to see just how far you've come. There are plenty of ways to increase the challenge even further, but by catering to both ends of the spectrum, Jamestown opens itself up to players who may feel intimidated by the genre.       All of the destruction and chaos in Jamestown is presented with great pixel art. Each stage is immaculately detailed, right down to the sashes on the red coats' jackets and tentacles on the Martian forces. And with the numerous explosions ripping through each stage, you might mistake this for a top-down version of Metal Slug. Somber orchestral tracks are juxtaposed throughout against the ridiculous storyline and grow bombastic in the game itself. Filled with style and substance, Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony is a great top-down shooter.  "
4578,ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,4.0,0,"PC sports gamers have been largely ignored for a long time now. Aside from EA Sports, nearly every other major publisher of sports games has moved its efforts to the current generation of console systems. So while Xbox, PS2, and GameCube owners get to enjoy three or four different games representing each of the four big North American professional sports, computer owners have to make do with one baseball game, one football game, and so on. Such a lack of choice has caused a lot of die-hard computer-sports-game buffs to feel neglected. A cure for that feeling can be found in FarSight Studios and Konami of America's ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002. Unfortunately, being stuck with only the Madden series depicting football on the PC doesn't seem so terrible after a bout with this game, which is every bit as awful as its release date more than a month after the Super Bowl might suggest. If having a choice means that you have to endure poorly designed, ugly, bug-ridden shovelware like this, better then to have no choice at all.   Actually, NFL PrimeTime 2002 isn't a choice for many of its prospective victims. Bugs have been widely reported, and our test system--more than a match for the recommended system requirements and equipped with a GeForce3 Ti 500--experienced frequent crashes. Playing games in 32-bit color at video resolutions above the default 640x480 was impossible, as every attempt resulted in an immediate crash that not only shut the game down, but also rebooted our machine. Switching to 16-bit color enabled us to play above 640x480, though random drops to the desktop continued to be a problem. In all, the game probably crashed at least twice for every game that we successfully completed.   Even when you can get the game to run, playing just isn't worthwhile. While the list of available options is solid--with the inclusion of a thorough franchise play mode offsetting the absence of an Internet multiplayer option--the gameplay is a pastiche of everything that people complained about in computer football games a few years ago. The computer is far from astute as a coach, no matter which of the four difficulty settings you're using. Play-calling choices are often straight from the Bizarro World's Pop Warner league, complete with running the ball repeatedly in long-yardage situations and throwing repeatedly when stuck in a situation where running out the clock is advisable. Get the computer club back on its heels inside its own five-yard line, and it will do nothing but throw long, no matter how much time is left on the clock, no matter what the score. We've come back to win more than one game because the computer chose to go for an unnecessary first down instead of just letting the clock expire.   The game also does a subpar job of general clock management. Computer plays are called instantly, leaving a minimum of 25 seconds on the play clock, meaning that you'll be able to get off many more plays than would be possible in a real NFL game. This makes it hard to keep scores close to their real-world equivalents, even when you're playing with five-minute quarters. Playing with full 15-minute quarters is impossible, unless you want to see scores in arena football territory.   The play mechanics are equally disappointing. Compensating for the second-rate artificial intelligence is the computer's uncanny ability to pull off long bombs and make interceptions at opportune times. Because of this, scores typically remain close when they shouldn't, and you begin to feel like the game is cheating. Control issues also make you feel like some cheating is going on. Players glide across the turf as if they were skating, making it hard to make precise moves and cuts. Animations appear to skip frames. Tackles happen with all the suddenness of a bolt of lightning--one moment the defensive player is three yards away, the next he's got the ballcarrier on the ground. Additionally, there is no gray area with tackling. If an opposing player gets close, the ballcarrier is going down, no matter how well he uses the speed burst, juke, spin, stiff-arm, or other specialty moves. This works both ways, of course, though it still seems like the game is compensating for unsatisfactory AI with these magic tackles. After all, if players weren't taken down so easily, the game would be even more of a wide-open scorefest than it is already.   The visual quality is at the same low level as everything else here. The player models are rough, with blocky faces and knees and elbows so sharp that every tackle should result in a dozen stitches for everyone involved. The models also seem incomplete. Close-ups shown between plays often let you look through players' helmets to the sky above or peer through their shoulders at the sidelines. Players also frequently shudder during play, causing a strobe-light effect that makes it difficult to keep your eyes on the screen, and they sometimes flicker when standing on the sidelines. The weather effects exacerbate the latter problem, with snowflakes and players often flashing as much as a broken neon sign. But NFL PrimeTime 2002 isn't all bad visually. The stadium art is pretty good, particularly the animated crowds and textures used for the grass and turf. Team-specific banners are used to further customize each club's home field. Also, the player models get dirty as games go on. Mud and grass stains show up on their uniforms and helmets when playing on natural turf, a subtle touch that reinforces the ""down in the trenches"" feeling that football is all about.   The audio quality is also spotty, though it is better overall than the game's visual components. Much of this edge is due to the ESPN signature voices of Chris Berman and Tom Jackson, who provide all the play-by-play and color commentary. Berman's contributions are particularly welcome, as they do a good job of describing the on-field action with a minimum of hyperbole and a good sprinkling of players' names among accounts of what's happening. Jackson isn't quite so useful. Most of his lines consist of catchphrases like, ""The offensive coordinator didn't have that in mind when he drew up that play."" The only saving grace is the sheer number of these bland comments. In-game effects include the standard thumps and smacks, though a number of expected effects are missing. It's odd that penalties aren't announced and that audibles are called without a peep.   Which is in some ways fitting, because ""without a peep"" is exactly how ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002 should disappear. Feeble gameplay makes the game unappealing, and the number of serious bugs that have come along for the ride make it completely unacceptable. The idea of having an alternative to EA Sports' award-winning Madden series is apparently superior to the reality, at least if this is the only choice available. "
2499,Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz,5.0,1,"    too hard, but there's always a way to make it through each level and towards the goal at the end, even if the solution isn't immediately obvious. That's so long as you stick to the analogue stick controls, though. Trying to complete anything but the easiest of levels with the motion controls is a painful experience--they simply aren't accurate enough, not to mention that it's difficult to see the screen when you're tilting it away from your face to slow your monkey ball down. That lack of precision also makes collecting bananas all the more difficult, which you need to do to earn high scores, or extra lives and continues should you fall off the edge of a platform one to many times.     You can relive those glorious moments of failure by saving replays of them to one of 16 slots, and you can share them--along with replays of your successes--with other Banana Blitz players. It's nowhere near as useful as sharing full-track playthroughs, but there are some amusing bailouts to be found online. Speaking of online, Banana Blitz features a full multiplayer mode via online and ad hoc connections, as well as simple pass-the-handheld play. Unfortunately, the multiplayer modes don't make use of the franchise's classic gameplay and instead focus on a series of minigames.      And those minigames are something of a mess. Things start off promisingly enough with Monkey Target, where you launch your monkey ball off a ramp and float it through the air, pass through checkpoints, and attempt to land on a platform at the end. There are three variations of the mode that change up the layout of the final landing platform--including a neat pinball-inspired layout--but all variants quickly become repetitive. So too does Monkey Bowling and its touch-screen controls that make it far too easy to score a strike each and every time, even on levels where there are warped lanes or gaps.       Those are the best of the bunch, though. Take Monkey Rodeo, an infuriating game where you have to collect bananas by bouncing ball-riding monkeys around with the rear touch pad. It's nigh on impossible to control your monkey and earn points, and the overly aggressive AI relentlessly smashes into you. There's the sluggish Battle Billiards too, which, despite the injection of monkeys in balls, fails to make playing billiards at all exciting. But the very worst of the lot is Pixie Hunt. Here, you're asked to use the Vita's camera to take photos of objects that match the colour of the reticle and…that's it. That's the whole game. The fact that someone, somewhere, at some stage in this game's development thought that was entertaining is maddening.      Similarly maddening is the promisingly titled Edit mode, which isn't actually a way to create your own wacky Monkey Ball courses using the touch screen. Instead, it's a simple random course generator that lets you snap a picture using the Vita's camera and use it as a background. That's incredibly disappointing. Fun (if not wholly original) as the classic Monkey Ball mode may be, it's not enough to prop up the rest of this confused mishmash of mundane minigames.    "
4691,NCAA Final Four 2004,3.0,0," It's entirely appropriate that Nick Collison is the cover athlete for 989 Sports' NCAA Final Four 2004. Currently missing the entire 2003-2004 NBA season after undergoing surgery on both of his shoulders, Collison accurately represents the state of Final Four 2004--broken and in need of some serious rehabilitation. The game is hopelessly primitive in almost every conceivable way.   The problems start with the graphics. Player models look decent, but their animations look stiff and somewhat robotic. The crowds have a laughable lack of detail, and the arenas are very generic. Additionally, the floor is strangely vacant. While the team benches are included, there are huge spaces on the floor that are empty in those places where you'd normally expect to see fans in the expensive sideline seats. Don't anticipate seeing any cameramen, fans, or cheerleaders along the empty-looking baselines either.      The biggest problem is that the game seems to lack any sort of transitional animations. Going from a running dribble to a shooting or passing motion often results in the player ""popping"" oddly from one motion to the other. You'll also see players sliding over the court as if they're ice-skating. This is particularly noticeable when you get your players set in a defensive stance.   The sound is nothing to write home about either. While the basic sounds of the game, like dribbling and dunking, are passable, the crowd doesn't seem to be a factor. The game's announcing is particularly terrible. Handled by Eddie Doucet and Billy Packer, the duo seems to have graduated from the three-word school of broadcasting. They hardly say anything aside from short, nondescript phrases, like ""Takes the pass,"" ""Snares the board,"" and ""Not so fast.""   As far as gameplay goes, Final Four 2004 seems to have an odd sense of pacing when it comes to how fast the players can move. The default run/walk speed seems normal, but if you use the turbo button, your players all seem to run faster than a track sprinter. Controlling a guard while on defense, we were able to literally run circles around the opposing point guard as he walked the ball into the frontcourt. Players going up for a dunk seem to go into slow motion as they crouch down and gather themselves for the leap. Then, all of a sudden, the game seems to speed up unnaturally as they jump up and down with blinding speed. It's as if the animators used a taut spring as their model for players who are leaping up for a dunk. It all adds up to a game that feels entirely herky-jerky and lacks a sense of grace or fluidity.   Perhaps the worst problem--in a game that seems to have no shortage of them--is that the controls are totally unresponsive. For some strange reason, the game will often fail to register button input from the controller. You frequently have to pound on the pass or shoot buttons to make anything happen, and when you do, the results are usually unpredictable. Inbounding the ball after a made basket is a great example. If you press the pass button without pressing any direction on the stick, the passer will often choose to toss a high-risk pass all the way downcourt, instead of just flipping the ball to the point guard who's standing right in front of him.   Players in Final Four 2004 jump up and down so quickly that it's difficult to time your perimeter shots. Why settle for a jumper when you can get a dunk on almost every possession, though? Much like 989's NBA Shootout, you can simply run your player back and forth to try and get your defender caught up in a pile of bodies; after you've accomplished this, you've freed yourself for an open dunk. And why not? Even short point guards seem to have the ability to throw down vicious windmill dunks and two-handed tomahawks in Final Four 2004. If you can't shake your man, simply wiggling the right analog stick will unleash some juke moves that will quickly cause your defender to stumble. Again, even the tallest and clumsiest of centers seem to have the ability to break down defenders off the dribble. Overall, there's not much need to worry about ball movement--as in real college basketball--and the computer doesn't seem to change up its defensive schemes to try and fool you.      Final Four 2004's dynasty mode is the very definition of bare-bones. There is no create-a-school function, and while the game includes a create-a-player feature for single season and tournament modes, no such feature is included for dynasty play. This is a rather big problem because none of this year's freshmen crop seems to be included in the team rosters. Once you pick a school, you can choose to name your coach. After that, however, you have few options. Accurate schedules for the 2003-2004 season are available, but you're not allowed to customize your schedule at all. After the initial season, your slate of nonconference games is chosen at random--and you're stuck with it. There are no slider settings to dictate your team tendencies as you simulate through the season. About the only interesting feature available is that you can set your team's practice schedule and dictate which facets of the game they will work on in practice.   The off-season recruiting is mindless. You can peruse lists of high school players from around the country, view their stats, and see how much interest they have in your school. All you have to do is visit them several times to pique their interests, however, and at the end of the recruiting period, you'll have several players you can choose to sign on as new freshmen. There's absolutely zero strategy involved. You just keep visiting the players you want, and, hopefully, their interest levels rise enough so that you can sign them.   Yes, the game includes an online mode that has an impressive feature set that's similar to 989's pro game, NBA Shootout 2004. You can chat with other players in the lobby, communicate on message boards, and participate in tournaments. But the question begging to be asked is: For a game this bad, does online functionality really matter?   Final Four 2004 is, without a doubt, the worst basketball game released this year, college or pro. It offers a subpar effort--across the board--in graphics, sound, gameplay, and extras (like the simplistic dynasty mode, for example). If you're looking for a basketball game to buy, steer clear of Final Four 2004.  "
245,Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier,7.0,2,"The first time I dropped into a game of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, my main opponent was the clutter on my phone's screen. The game's smattering of touchscreen controls include an analog stick for moving around, a button to shoot, another button for a melee attack, one for jumping and parkouring, and one for crouching and hiding. Get close to a treasure chest and you can open it with another button. There's the inventory menu for swapping between weapons, and the one for using your consumable items to heal. And there's the section of the screen dedicated to Materia, the little orbs you can find that give Final Fantasy VII characters the ability to use magic.Because The First Soldier is a mobile game, all that stuff sits on the screen, occupying the same space you're expected to fight off other players in. It's cumbersome--half the time, my thumbs were in the way of the action. The other half, I couldn't remember which button to hit to call down some lightning bolts in a fight or to dash my way out of danger in a pinch.Plenty of battle royale games, including big-market favorites like Fortnite and PUBG, have mobile versions. And plenty of players enjoy them, even though they reach a similar complexity to The First Soldier. But Square Enix's Final Fantasy take on the genre throws even more systems into play than those other games with the addition of classes, magic, and mounts. It all feels like too much for my little phone screen to handle. And that's a shame, because The First Soldier is a compelling take on battle royale. A Final Fantasy version of last-player-standing is great fun--provided you can hit the buttons you want to and see the enemies you're fighting.The idea behind The First Soldier is that operatives of Shinra, Final Fantasy VII's energy megacorp with its own private military, are squaring off against each other as part of elite special forces training. SOLDIER, in the game's universe, refers to a division of high-level operatives who are feared on the battlefield. Cloud, FFVII protagonist, is one such SOLDIER, as is Sephiroth, the game's incredibly powerful villain. So this is, to some degree, the story of how those legendary operatives first came to stand above the rank-and-file Shinra military: by fighting on huge battle royale battlefields.In practice, this is pretty much like every BR you've played, if you're familiar with the genre. Players drop into a huge map (in this case, the undercity slums of Midgar, complete with a few recognizable places from Final Fantasy VII Remake) and search for weapons and items to fight against any other competitors they happen to run up against, with the last player or team standing declared the winner. Over time, the playfield shrinks, and anyone caught outside of the ""ring"" defining the new battlefield takes damage. Like games such as PUBG or Fortnite, you can grab vehicles randomly placed around the map to make the journey go a little quicker, although at the cost of making yourself conspicuous to other players. You can also quickly parkour up most vertical surfaces just by running and jumping at them, allowing you to change elevations, set traps for players, and circumvent obstacles.As in other BR games, you'll use firearms to do most of your fighting. The First Soldier is a third-person shooter at heart, and there are guns of various types and rarities that determine their effectiveness. Constantly searching for better guns, or taking them off the corpses of your enemies, is key for surviving long enough to claim victory. On the whole, the guns in The First Soldier feel pretty good, and the differences in the ways they handle--like the heavy recoil but high damage of a submachine gun, compared to the longer range but less crushing assault rifle--make your choices of what to take with you pretty meaningful. Add to that the fact that you can only carry two guns at a time and your weapon decisions have a major effect on the game.However, where The First Soldier sets itself apart is with all the Final Fantasy VII elements it adds to the BR formula. In addition to guns, you can find and carry up to three Materia orbs, each of which represents a different magic spell. You can cast magic using mana you either recover over time or find in destructible boxes, much like in FFVII Remake, and having certain kinds of magic at your disposal can be a massive game-changer. A Thunder spell blasts a whole area with electricity, restricting your enemy's movements, while a Fire spell is akin to hucking a bomb at somebody that sends them flying. With things like Gravity for locking players to a spot, Bio for poisoning anyone unfortunate enough to wander into its noxious cloud, and Cure for healing yourself, magic adds a deep layer of strategy to the usual battle royale gunplay. As in FF7, you can level up your Materia to make it more effective by finding copies of the Materia you already have, giving you another incentive to continually loot the world around you and the players you fight.You also choose a ""class"" for your character at the start of each match, which comes with its own caveats. In addition to the guns you find, each character gets a melee attack, which is determined by your class, plus a special ability. The Knight class gets a melee dash attack that also provides you with a brief shield against attacks, for example; the Mage class can drop an arcane ward on the ground that quickly recharges mana; the Ninja can briefly become invisible to sneak away from opponents or relocate in the midst of battle. There are five classes in total, and the longer you survive with one, the higher your class level reaches, boosting your attacks and your abilities as a reward for staying alive until the end of the match.And finally, there are accessory items you can find for your character, which add special bonuses like damage protection outside of the ring, resistance to certain types of magic, or better luck in finding money on the ground for use in The First Soldier's many vending machines.All those systems bring the RPG ideas of Final Fantasy 7 Remake to The First Soldier, and they really help to freshen up the battle royale formula--even if it means a ton of controls competing for screen space on your phone. The possibilities of things like surprising an opponent with a fireball, unloading on them with a shotgun, and then closing off their retreat with a Thunder spell make for some pulse-pounding, strategic fights. Combat in The First Soldier has its similarities to other BR games on the market, but the addition of magic and class abilities, plus accessories and the in-match level-up systems, means it also gains some of the best elements of FF7 Remake. There's just nothing else really like it.When you're able to execute your attack commands quickly and fluidly, battles against opponents feel great. There's a lot to keep in mind, but once you get the hang of utilizing it all under fire, fights are gripping, intense, and unpredictable. You can also execute really fun strategies, like catching an enemy in a doorway with a fireball to trap them inside or placing a poison field near cover to flush an opponent out of hiding.The trouble is that things get frantic on a touchscreen, especially as you're battling to keep the camera aimed at the action and competing with the controls to see what's going on. The camera in particular is a huge pain, since you have to swipe at your screen to rotate it, which means you can't use other controls with that thumb at the same time. It can take melee off the table altogether, more or less, since the close proximity you need to attack other players means you can whiz past them, putting them behind you and therefore out of sight.Because of the touchscreen issues, The First Soldier improves by a huge leap if you use a Bluetooth controller to play it. When I plugged a controller in, my experience changed dramatically for the better. Suddenly, I could execute every attack I wanted to whenever I wanted to, while keeping the camera aimed where I needed it to be. There are still maybe too many controls to handle elegantly--between shooting, using consumables, and throwing magic, you often have to hold one button while pressing another to have enough commands to get everything done--but using a controller was a huge step forward in making The First Soldier work. The controller feels like a significant advantage over touchscreen controls, even in just being able to reliably manipulate the camera so you can see who you're fighting. Returning to touch controls after using a controller highlights how much the game strains the real estate of a phone screen.Once I could see everything I was doing and reliably execute the attacks I wanted, though, it became clear how well all the ideas of Final Fantasy VII work within the battle royale framework. Magic, guns, and swords go pretty damn well together, and The First Soldier becomes a very fun take on the BR formula that's both familiar and fresh.It's just that it feels like The First Soldier is a game that strains the confines of the mobile medium. Not only is the game overwhelmed by controls, but The First Soldier includes a bunch of additional systems that are fun in theory but in practice make the game a bit unwieldy for a medium meant to be played in short bursts. We haven't even mentioned The First Soldier's entire chocobo-breeding minigame, where you find eggs in special treasure chests in a match, hatch them, and then combine chocobos to get exactly the measure of stats you want. The birds you decide to keep can be marked for deployment in-game, so if you find a chocobo sign while playing a match, you can call your bird in battle to transport you around; you can even attack other players with chocobos, and they can be devastating if you're able to get close to a target. It's a fun system you can choose to engage with or completely ignore that further contributes to making The First Soldier feel like something new and different in the BR space, but it's something else to keep in mind when you're in matches, or to mess around with between runs, when you're probably only signing on for a quick match or two on your phone.I'm enjoying The First Soldier and I'll keep it in my BR rotation, but it already seems like a game I'll struggle to get better at. This is a battle royale title that's good enough, smart enough, and different enough to attract and keep a healthy player base--it's bursting at the smartphone's seams. On PC or console, The First Soldier would take a well-deserved place against other BR powerhouses, but on mobile, it's just too cramped."
2915,RAGE,7.0,2,"                When you're not engaged in firefights or friendly conversation, you spend a lot of time driving around the Wasteland. The various four-wheeled vehicles you come to own are fun to whip around in, and the stunning scenery is a constant source of enjoyment. As you drive from one area to the next, the quality of light changes to create a nice sense of travel. Bandits frequently come after you, and with the application of firepower, expendable items, and some judicious ramming, you assert your vehicular dominance. There are items for field repairs if you take too much damage, and if you find yourself about to explode (or hung up on a rock or guardrail), you can call for a tow and instantly travel back to the nearest town for a reasonable price. You can upgrade your ride or earn a new set of keys by racing on the Wasteland circuit, but your opponents rarely put up enough of a fight to force a photo finish. The car improvements are worth your time, but if you want a tough race, the competitive online multiplayer is the place to go.       Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, but regardless of which platform you play on, it still offers a rich and rewarding adventure.   "
2183,Batman: Arkham City,6.0,1,"Batman: Arkham City, Harley Quinn has it out for Batman in a big way. Harley Quinn's Revenge gives you a decent excuse to return to the immensely satisfying combat of Arkham City, and lets you play as Robin in a narrative context (as opposed to challenge rooms) for the first time. But unfortunately, this downloadable content feels restrictive in comparison to the original game, and it ends with a weak final confrontation that makes this a disappointing note on which to bring the Arkham City story to a close.       Like the original game, Harley Quinn's Revenge jumps between characters, but it adds a new narrative twist by jumping back and forth in time. You begin as Robin, who has ventured into a shipyard that has been taken over by Harley Quinn and her thugs. Chatter between Robin and Oracle establishes that in the two weeks that have passed since the events of Arkham City, Bruce Wayne has seemed depressed and unwilling to talk about the lives that were lost. The concept of Batman coming a bit unhinged and struggling with his emotions is exciting, but Harley Quinn's Revenge never develops it. It serves no purpose here other than to plant a seed in your brain about what condition Batman might be in when a sequel rolls around; within the context of this DLC, it just resonates with untapped potential.     As Robin, you make your way through Harley's base searching for Batman, who disappeared a few days earlier while trying to rescue some police officers Harley had kidnapped. Robin has a few unique gadgets, like the snap flash, which you can plant on unsuspecting baddies and then detonate to stun them and other nearby enemies, and a bullet shield that lets you withstand assaults from turrets for a limited time. On the other hand, he can't pull off all of the techniques that Batman can; he lacks the ability to do an inverted takedown, for instance.        But for the most part, playing as Robin feels just like playing as Batman. That's not a bad thing, of course. Arkham City's combat hasn't gotten any less hard-hitting and rewarding in the months since the game was released, and Robin's animations have him making graceful and brutal use of his metallic bo staff to hit and knock out enemies. But there's little freedom here; you use your shield when you need to and you fight enemies when you need to, as you're ushered down the narrow hallways and through the larger but still confined rooms of the shipyard.      Soon, the game flashes back to two days prior and puts you in control of Batman, revealing the circumstances that led up to his disappearance. Here, gameplay opens up a bit. Though you're restricted to the area around the steel mill where Harley Quinn is apparently holding the police officers she's kidnapped, you get to enjoy the freedom of Batman's glide and the satisfaction of diving into enemies from high above. The air around the mill is thick with the piercing lasers of sniper rifles, and the ground is crawling with thugs, so you have incentive to employ the full range of Batman's abilities as you work your way into the facility. It doesn't introduce any hazards you haven't already dealt with if you've played through Arkham City, but it's nonetheless a tense scenario that makes stepping back into the batsuit exciting.       The steel mill is a familiar location, having served as Joker's base during Arkham City. But it's worth revisiting; once you're inside, you see that Harley Quinn has made it her own, and a few of her decorative touches offer a disturbing glimpse into the state of her psyche. This DLC moves along at a snappy pace from this point on, jumping back and forth between its two playable characters and including challenging brawls against huge, varied groups of enemies, stealthy standoffs against patrolling guards, sections in which Batman must follow blood trails and interrogate thugs, and a race against the clock to find and defuse bombs.     This is all reliably engaging; if you enjoyed doing these things in Arkham City, you will find them no less enjoyable here. But the final confrontation these activities build up to is incredibly basic, and the cursory ending leaves the story's most fascinating elements unexplored. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of this DLC takes place indoors; you rarely get a chance to spread your batwings and experience the openness that helped make Arkham City so extraordinary. Once the credits roll on this roughly two-hour adventure, it's over; there's no option to continue exploring its locations, and the 30 balloons you can hunt down and pop aren't a compelling reason to return to Harley Quinn HQ. Fighting evil in Gotham still feels heroic, but this isn't the conclusion Arkham City deserves.   "
1804,Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,8.0,2,"   Metro Redux shooters; that would likely kill the game's 60 frames-per-second smoothness, which would be sacrilegious to the series. Call of Duty games typically provide the chance to snuff out enemies from afar in their campaigns, but surprisingly, there is only one such sequence in Advanced Warfare. To be fair, though, enemy weapon drops are plentiful in scoped firearms, often with the same see-through-walls technology as one of the tech grenades. Sledgehammer’s future vision of weapon tech is positively practical with heads-up displays that are as clean as they are informative. The game varies the action in other ways, such as with a riveting sequence involving a jet ski with diving capabilities. (The campaign's other brief vehicular sections are unremarkable.) Certainly, I would have preferred more of these breaks from standard combat over the arduous occasions when you're asked to push objects. It is hardly a pleasure to shove an overturned van while having to endure the intentionally abrasive metal-on-pavement noise that accompanies it. Advanced Warfare’s ties to the past are few. The only time you feel the weight of history is during the introductory chapter in Seoul: in a battle in which North Korea was invading South Korea in the mid-2050s, the 100th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement is not lost in the chaos. Instead of looking back, Sledgehammer Games delivers a future-facing story laden with disappointing predictability and villain posturing befitting a Roger Moore-era James Bond film. Advanced Warfare serves so many classic bad guy one-liners that by the final act my eye-rolling gave way to resignation. I was left hoping that this Call of Duty had a point to its uncharacteristically cartoon-like dramatics, but it instead leaves you with an unsatisfying conclusion driven by a tonally inconsistent script. When the credits roll, you may be disappointed the villain didn't round off his checklist of cliches by uttering, “We're not so different, you and I.” Call of Duty 4, as does having a hardened British field mentor at your side for many of the chapters. Even if an obligatory bridge chapter reinforces the campaign's shortage of originality, at least these instances do not take away from the consistent entertainment of the overall playthrough. It follows the typical rhythm of a Call of Duty campaign, in which consecutive ground combat sections are broken up with a chase, a cutscene, or a quick time event. Even though Advanced Warfare is set in the future, I’m glad Sledgehammer wasn’t compelled to show off nuclear-level devastation on the scale of Call of Duty: Ghosts' gratuitous opening. Nevertheless, Advanced Warfare stumbles when evocation gives way to shock with minimal exposition. This happens during a scene that's meant to echo World War II atrocities, depicting disturbing incidents of human experimentation. Without explanation or context, this scene only provokes for the sake of it, making any themes it raises tough subjects for meaningful discussion. Crysis games. Those games excel by minimizing the frustration of death, where getting killed gives you the opportunity to try a new path or strategy with each respawn. Many of Advanced Warfare’s sections are spacious enough to experiment with new routes, and provide optional opportunities to use the exosuit. Yet therein lies one of the campaign's shortcomings: a lack of incentives to frequently use the exosuit. In the campaign, using these movement abilities is seldom mandatory, but always optional, and many environments allow plenty of room in which to play around. Nevertheless, the plethora of cover points will easily keep you alive, so why take a chance of being exposed, considering enemies aren’t especially aggressive? The boost dashes and double jumps are immensely useful to evade enemies; not so much if you want to take the fight to them. The ability to hover in single player is only useful for the few times you need to stick a landing from a multistory drop. The thoroughness of the mobility-focused tutorial in the first chapter may lead you to think that the rest of the single-player mode would be rich in moments that encourage verticality, dodging, and temporary flight. Such events are only sprinkled through the game's 15 chapters, as there are too few sections in which using an exo ability is mandatory. The campaign is an entertaining ride as a whole, but being able to progress through most of it with a classic Call of Duty approach is wholly unfortunate, as it contradicts the expectations set by the futuristic motifs of the initial chapter in Seoul and that fantastical giant drone snake. His tours offer a smattering of memorable missions, including a fast-paced intra-city manhunt through Santorini and several pulse-quickening escape sequences. You can trust that bloodthirsty friends and strangers in multiplayer will make sure you know every movement ability, lest you desire a humbling kill/death ratio. You never forget your first death at the hands of an online opponent who outmaneuvered you with a midair strafe-double jump combo. The moment you witness such a move is the moment you want to learn it. The tired adage of ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" does not apply here; rather, it's “Moderately tough to learn, even tougher to master.” It's one thing to instantly see the benefits of a power slide or a double jump; it's another to apply these abilities in useful and practical ways. The lessons of First-Person Shooter Survival 101 and the economies of movement apply here: Just because you don't want to be killed while standing still doesn't mean you should be moving at all times. The maps aren’t quite like the Call of Duty maps you’ve played before: the upward mobility provided by the exosuit calls for more vertical structures. Advance Warfare does a fine job in addressing issues with first-person platforming, letting you catch the edges of rooftops if your double jump wasn’t as long as you expected. That’s not to say that the maps completely cater to every new ability. As fun as it is to evade a hunter by sliding under a pickup truck, these multiplayer maps aren’t packed with such escape points. This kind of scarcity only makes wise use of the slide move all the more meaningful. Map memorization is thus all the more crucial, especially given how the maps in Advanced Warfare are understandably larger than typical Call of Duty maps. Call of Duty: Black Ops II has expanded to 13 picks. This level of flexibility is tied to the one-size-fits-all-modes design philosophy of the 13 maps. Sledgehammer does not reconfigure arenas to suit a given game type; you are expected to adapt to each mode by having a custom loadout at the ready. A self-tailored speed-based loadout is crucial for the new point-based Uplink mode. This mode takes much of its inspiration from end-to-end goal-scoring sports like basketball and soccer, asking you to throw or dunk a device into an endpoint. Uplink is still primarily concerned with the shooting action, however, and thus defies categorization as a mere novelty mode. It’s also terribly absorbing. For all the futuristic weapons technology at your disposal, there's comfort in having these firearms in multiplayer sorted into familiar categories. Like donning a new pair of shoes with zero break-in time, creating a comfortable loadout of fictional weapons suited for Team Deathmatch takes little brainwork. If you’re a Call of Duty veteran, don't be surprised if your initial loadout yields a satisfying kill/death ratio after your very first match. The only thing better than slotting a high damage IMR assault rifle in your loadout is seeing immediate results through your bodycount. Progressing and obtaining rewards in Advanced Warfare's multiplayer is a layered experience, and Sledgehammer has erred on the side of excess. Beyond the straightforward rewards of actively participating in matches, the studio also recognizes the appeal of the blind box though its Supply Drop system. Considering that it would take tens upon tens of hours to unlock every possible Supply Drop item, it's a relief there's no risk of unlocking duplicate items. The one exception is if you convert an unwanted Supply Drop reward into experience, which is a practical option for some, but it opens up the possibility of unlocking that item again. Call of Duty: Black Ops, makes a much welcome return since it serves as Advanced Warfare's King of the Hill mode. Due to their fundamental similarities, Uplink could have easily replaced Capture the Flag as the only delivery-style match. Instead, both are offered, as if Sledgehammer is saying, “Let's give the fans almost every mode imaginable and let them decide what will be the popular modes in six months’ time.” The finishing touch on this rich inventory of content is an acknowledgement to the Call of Duty purists: four classic modes (Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy) that are played without exo movement. This works both as a throwback to familiar locomotion and as an experiment on how traditional matches would play out in maps larger than prior Call of Duty multiplayer maps. You won’t find anything as tiny as the ‘Hijacked’ yacht from Black Ops 2; some maps in Advanced Warfare can fit a boat three times that size. Call of Duty: Ghosts, Advanced Warfare's multiplayer shows restraint in dynamic map events. A tsunami warning in the San Francisco map will compel many first timers to hurriedly search for higher ground, only to realize the ensuing flood is a laughably minor and temporary one. Sledgehammer should also be commended for designing original multiplayer maps without borrowing heavily from the single-player locales. Equally impressive are the settings not featured in the campaign, including a volcano in Hawaii and a space elevator platform in the Gulf of Mexico. These maps are generally roomy, but hardly bereft of confining spaces and narrow hallways. In sector-control modes like Momentum and Hardpoint, the hallways in maps like Bio Lab and Greenband make for brutally crowded gunfights ripe for increasing both your kill and death counts. These battles would be frustrating were the chaos in the moment not so fun and hilarious. Advanced Warfare foregoes the novelty of ghosts and zombies in its wave-based cooperative mode, dubbed Exo-Survival. It's just as well; when you have drones, double-jumping soldiers, and hulking armored suits swarming towards your foursome, are supernatural armed forces necessary? As if to boast the versatility of the 13 multiplayer maps, none of the locales have been altered to suit any specific needs for human-versus-bot combat. The maps are divided into four difficulty tiers, partly based on how the terrain of each setting helps or hurts your team. For example, the three points of entry in the hotel lobby of the Terrace map make this reception area an ideal home base. The challenge arrives when you must leave the comforts of the lobby during non-defensive missions. When you only have 90 seconds to collect 20 dog tags and a map that is as tall as it is wide, a team that splits up without pairing up is most likely a dead one. The map called Riot, on the other hand, has little to no spots in which to safely huddle for a defensive posture, so it's no surprise that it's the only Tier 4 map. If you're looking for a first-person recreation of the nerve-wracking “elevated position” scene from the film < The Rock, play the Riot map in Exo-Survival. Level complexity is a factor, and is one of the reasons why the modest two-story Bio-Lab map is classified as Tier 1. With many obvious bot entry points, Bio-Lab is a fitting starter map for Exo-Survival newcomers. Surviving a round yields currency to spend on upgrades, and it's not unusual to max out armor or weapon stats by the 30th round. The likelihood of passing 40 rounds on a first or second attempt brings about two classic yet unexpected opponents: complacency and overconfidence. You seldom see this issue in wave-based survival modes, where the progression of difficulty is often much steeper. Even in a Tier 1 map, ending a session should be the result of your team dying, not of your team getting bored and wanting to try try a harder tier. I would have preferred the option of elevating to a higher tier after clearing 40 or so rounds so my teammates could maintain their momentum without having to back out into the lobby. The last time Call of Duty had “Warfare” in its subtitle, it led to a well-received trilogy that deftly transitioned the series away from a well-trodden global conflict to modern-day combat. If the settings of today have run their course just as World War II did years ago, Advanced Warfare makes for a convincing foundation of futuristic yet relatable combat that is worth exploring and expanding further. The huge change in player mobility is less of a paradigm shift and more of an overdue retooling for an 11-year-old FPS franchise, especially in a year of mobility-focused shooters. Yet for all its predictability, Advanced Warfare is a deluge of action-film bravado, and it's difficult to not be carried away by its tidal forces.  "
166,We Are OFK,7.0,2,"We Are OFK follows pianist Itsumi Saitō, singer/songwriter Luca Le Fae, audiovisual artist Carter Flores, and producer Jey Zhang, and depicts how their lives come to intersect. The point A to point B throughline of the story culminates in Itsumi, Luca, Carter, and Jey forming a band. You know going in that this is the outcome you'll see. But on the way to that destination, the story takes regular detours into Itsumi's love life, Luca's writer's block, Carter's existential crisis, and Jey's familial pressures. It's in these other storylines that We Are OFK adopts a more slice-of-life style of storytelling, concluding with most of these issues left partially unresolved.If anything, that only makes the conclusion to We Are OFK all the more satisfyingly believable and wonderful to reach. There are no typical bad guys here for the group to overcome and get their happily-ever-after ending. This is a story of what it means to grow, both as a person and as a group, and how that can come in many different forms and also occur at a different pace person-to-person. Carter's arc is notably exceptional in its execution and probably my favorite storyline of the four. The arc sees them grappling with grief and coming to terms with what it means to leave a mark on the world while working within an industry where your work can be quickly forgotten. Itsumi has a similarly strong narrative path from the first episode to the last, which largely digs into her feelings of inadequacy and fear of being alone. Both characters resonated with me in a way that Luca and Jey did not--both do have strong storylines, but they don't feel as compelling as Itsumi or Carter.You don't get to control Itsumi, Luca, Carter, and Jey's actions or thoughts on their respective journeys--Itsumi's life will always be adrift following a break-up and she will always experience a loss of passion for the piano, for example, and you can't prevent Luca from reaching out to an emotional support tipline after his job leaves him feeling isolated and creatively parched, but We Are OFK allows you to guide how the four express themselves in their conversations with one another.Dialogue choices represent a bandwidth of how a character can express themselves in a given moment. For instance, when Itsumi is being hit on by a creepy guy at a bar, she thinks about different ways she can say, ""Go away,"" to get out of the conversation. This does allow you to color We Are OFK's story with your own brush, but it's not very rewarding, as the game simply provides you with different shades of the same color. Regardless of whether you try to ignore the guy or change the subject, it all boils down to Itsumi trying to leave the conversation without making too much of a scene. There's not much meaning behind the choices you pick as a result, as you're more or less just getting different flavors of the same response. In the case of this example, Jey ultimately always has to step in because the guy isn't taking a hint.A few times, We Are OFK does include a fun callback to a previous moment in its story and makes reference to a dialogue choice you made. These moments are few and far between, however, and only occur within the same episode--your choices in Episodes 1 and 2 have no effect on what occurs in Episodes 3, 4, and 5. There are jokes, references, and callbacks that span multiple episodes, such as Itsumi and Carter changing one another's names in their phone contacts list in Episode 5 to reflect a heart-to-heart conversation they had in Episode 4, but these narrative payoffs are in reference to scripted moments you have no control over. They're fun to notice and add an extra bit of authenticity to the character development of the core cast--I know at least a dozen people who list their closest friends on their phone by dumb nicknames or pun-inspired titles, so seeing Itsumi and Carter do it made me laugh--but they're a reminder that you don't have much sway on this story. You're more a passive observer than an active part of the group.It's odd--We Are OFK features more opportunities for player input than what I largely expect of a visual novel, but that increase in interactivity does not then translate into the potential to make a meaningful difference in the story. The game feels at odds with whether it wants the player to participate or just watch.Between the two, We Are OFK feels like it's most leaning towards the latter, as its episodic format more closely resembles a TV show than a video game. Each episode is about an hour long (the longest is closer to an hour and a half), features an intro sequence and credits, and--after the simultaneous release of Episodes 1 and 2--will release on a weekly schedule. Each episode concludes with an intriguing setup for whatever is next, working as a good draw to entice folks to tune in the following week. However, Episodes 2 and 3 are noticeably weaker than the rest of the game, as they, respectively, focus on Luca and Jey's less interesting narrative arcs. Having all five episodes available at once allowed me to easily push through these rougher patches, but some players might not be motivated to return if they're forced to wait a couple of weeks to get to Episode 4.The most interactive elements of We Are OFK occur near the end of each episode when you play through a music video. Each video features one of the singles included in OFK's first EP. There's no way to fail these segments; instead, they allow you to inject a bit of creativity into the construction of the video. For example, near the end of Episode 1, you control Itsumi as she completes various tasks, chases her phone, and pushes people away from her during OFK's debut song, Follow/Unfollow. The song sees Luca singing about moments of self-sabotage following an especially heartbreaking end to a relationship, and, up to that point, Episode 1 largely focuses on Itsumi as she struggles with those very feelings. So as her internal conflict reaches a climax, you can interpret how she'd react to the words Luca is singing. Maybe you think she'd do everything at a frantic pace, or perhaps she'd carefully move through the scene, or even keep messing up at the task at hand and get nothing done.I really like these moments, especially the ones when the interactive elements are mechanically minimalist and allow you to better react to the music and exist within the flow of the song. Episode 4's music video suffers in this regard, as it sees you playing as Carter and needing to skateboard through virtual reality, steering and jumping to collect tokens. There's also a building segment interspersed between the skateboarding parts, where you can place hills, trees, rocks, and other decorations onto a spinning environment to create your own custom island. It's a lot, which makes it trickier to also pay attention to the song itself.You can replay each episode or music video after completing them once, so you can easily go back and redo any segments of the story or songs that you missed the first time, but the initial amazement of that first time is lost on subsequent playthroughs. A great deal of the enjoyment that comes with the music videos is related to being thrust into a new chorus or verse and being handed new mechanics, encouraging you to adapt and exist within the tone of the song and the narrative themes that lead up to it. There's less surprise and, consequently, less enjoyment on repeated runs.That said, I did still replay certain music video segments a few times if only to listen to specific songs again. OFK's first EP is a banger from start to finish. The band's first five songs all fall into alternative indie, but tonally cover a wider spectrum of emotions, ranging from celebratory and high-energy to more melancholy and dream-like. The songs that play near the end of Episodes 2 and 5 are notable stand-outs--the former has been stuck in my head all week, while the latter is a great get-up-and-dance-right-now track.The game's visuals complement the music style, dressing the characters and environments in vibrant colors. Though this style most comes alive during the music video segments to visually illustrate each song with flashing color, it's used to great effect throughout the entire visual novel. We Are OFK's Los Angeles is detailed with all the sun and glamour of possibility that the city is often idealized as having, especially in the early chapters. It almost seems like a dream, with how colorful and exciting everything is. And that's exactly what that preconception is: a figment of the imagination. The real LA is alive with possibility, but--as the cast of young creators quickly learns--there's a harsh reality of bills to pay, expectations to meet, and heartbreak to work through that's hidden beneath that glittering glam. And in those moments, when the facade of LA falls away, the color of the game shifts from bright pinks, yellows, purples, and blues to more somber shades of brown, red, orange, and black. It's great for setting the tone of a scene.All in all, I enjoyed my time with We Are OFK. Even for a visual novel, the storyline can feel a bit too on the rails at times, but Itsumi, Carter, Luca, and Jey's journey is poignant in its relatability and powerful in its narrative exploration through music. This is best expressed in the interactive music video segments, especially when they allow you to fully lose yourself in the song and respond to the vocals, rhythm, or accompanying visuals in your own way. It's a good opening track for OFK's career, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the virtual group."
3470,ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead,8.0,2,"Arma II set a high standard for the all-purpose military simulator, its buggy single-player campaign held it back from achieving its full potential. In contrast, Arma II: Operation Arrowhead, its stand-alone expansion, boasts all the beauty, realism, and action of the original and none of the game-breaking bugs. Improving upon its predecessor in almost every way, Arrowhead introduces a new setting, new weapons, and new adventures to a great military sandbox.        Much like its predecessor, the primary selling point of Operation Arrowhead is its setting, which swaps the thick forests of Chernarus in favor of the vast mountain ranges, boundless steppes, and parched deserts of the fictitious Central Asian country of Takistan. Both the natural landscapes and the various human settlements, including the teeming capital city of Zargabad that notably boasts a gorgeous Persian-style mosque decorated with mosaic tiles, are characterized by meticulous attention to detail that reveals the story of the place. For instance, the mountains are filled with quaint, well-worn trails, while outside the prayer room of the mosque, you'll find the shoes of the worshippers within. However, the tranquil beauty of Takistan hides a nation in turmoil. The Saddam Hussein-esque Colonel Aziz (who has a penchant for gaudy artwork and carries a golden gun) and his military junta have launched an invasion of their oil-rich neighbors in Karzeghistan. Not amused by Aziz's tomfoolery, the United States has vowed to overthrow the adventurous junta and has sent in the military to do the job. You take on the role of several different US soldiers during the course of the campaign, whose combined efforts will ultimately lead you to victory. Along the way, you'll encounter Takistani military forces operating T-34 tanks and other aging Russian military hardware; hostile, pro-government militias; UN peacekeepers; and antigovernment rebels who will join your cause.     While Arrowhead's campaign can't match the play time, freedom, and decision-making possibilities in Arma II, it surpasses the original by providing a refined, bug-free experience. And, although it loses a bit of the historical backstory of Arma II, Arrowhead makes up for it by leaving out the boring exposition and dropping you straight into the action. Right from the beginning, you'll be occupied with a diverse array of missions and objectives. For example, in one mission, you get to capture a mine with the aid of a friendly militia, search for missing hostages, find and disarm a bomb (using a code with exotic Takistani numerals), transfer control of the mine to the United Nations, and, finally, man a dilapidated Soviet antiaircraft battery to stop enemy MiGs from bombing a rebel village. Other missions range from classic, brutally difficult Arma infantry combat to sequences where you command infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, tanks, and helicopters.        In contrast to the punishing realism of even the easiest difficulty levels in Arma II, Arrowhead offers a more approachable point of entry for new players, with its easier ""regular"" difficulty (veteran and expert difficulties are as hard as ever) and thorough tutorials. However, if you're a newbie, the coddling ends quickly because unlike in Arma II, where you spend several missions as a grunt, Arrowhead puts you in command of a mechanized squad in the second mission. Even after playing the tutorials, it can be hard to remember all the controls, and nothing is more frustrating than accidentally ordering your platoon to exit its vehicles in the midst of a tank battle. Thankfully, with time and practice, you'll improve your leadership skills, but even great tutorials and diligent attempts to practice will turn only a select few players into master helicopter pilots. It's difficult to stay airborne for more than a limited time before crashing unceremoniously into a minaret. Mercifully, you don't have to complete the campaign's helicopter mission to continue. Even after failing, in the next mission, you get the option to rescue the pilot, who apparently survived a 200mph collision with an unfortunate mountain goat or whatever gruesome end you inevitably caused him to suffer.     You'll find an abundance of novel weapons, vehicles, and equipment throughout the game, which provide exciting new ways to liberate (or terrorize) Takistan. These include World War II-era relics, such as Soviet T-34 tanks and British Lee Enfield bolt-action rifles, as well as modern, cutting-edge toys like unmanned aerial vehicles and thermal weapon sights. These are particularly awesome because they use infrared radiation to help you identify potential threats, such as vehicles, human beings, and rabbits. Since pro-US militiamen give off the same amount of heat as Takistani soldiers, it is ill advised to shoot at every human-shaped target you stumble across using this tool.          If you don't get your fill of gadgets and guns in the campaign, every weapon, vehicle, item, and character is available in both the editor and the armory. And, if you have Arma II as well, its content is also available. In the editor, your opportunities for mayhem are infinite, ranging from detailed scenarios with objectives and triggers for the experts to simple skirmishes that are quickly concocted by laymen. Meanwhile, Arrowhead's armory offers up challenges to test your skill with the new equipment, vehicles, and characters. Although putting Eurowoman1 through an obstacle course or trying to set speed records in a T-34 can be mildly amusing, these diversions don't have the editor's lasting appeal.        Stand-alone single-player missions are another highlight in Arrowhead. One of the most exhilarating missions puts you in command of a sniper team charged with eliminating a high-ranking Takistani officer while he visits a military base. With only 10 minutes before his arrival by helicopter, you have to cover a kilometer's distance, sneak past enemy patrols, identify the target (hint: the man everyone salutes) using only thermal sights as a guide, ""neutralize"" him, and escape. With several varied operations to choose from, these missions even further extend the single-player experience.     Although Arrowhead inherits a few annoyances from the original, even those are much improved. Most notably, the artificial intelligence still has some driving issues and can cause traffic jams and bizarre wrecks, but AI drivers are now much more conscientious about flattening friendlies. This is a major improvement over Arma II, in which it wasn't uncommon to be run over by an allied tank that would brake for a clutch of chickens but not for you. Arma's characteristic arrested, monotone chatter returns in Arrowhead, but it sounds a bit more natural this time. Anyway, how can you be angry at your stuttering ally for warning you about that ""tank…T72…at…3 o'clock…50 meters?""     Multiplayer in Arrowhead can be great fun, but little has changed here from Arma II. Whether you are playing a cooperative scenario, engaging in conventional deathmatches, or playing the real-time-strategy-reminiscent warfare mode, hopping into a random Internet game is like being plunged into an unpredictable maelstrom. Some servers feature crazy original scenarios with unclear objectives, some are role-playing servers where you are apparently just supposed to explore the level and will be kicked if you kill someone, and some still are cooperative matches populated by uncooperative people too busy scurrying about the map without any discernable purpose to bother communicating with you. However, when you actually get a group together that halfway knows what it's doing and coordinates via voice chat, then you are in for an exceptional experience. Thus, as with its predecessor, Arrowhead's multiplayer is perfect for clans, organized matches, and LAN parties.        Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an excellent expansion. It provides an abundance of new content, including at least 15 hours of gameplay before you even touch the editor or enter a multiplayer match, a beautiful new Central Asian setting, and a respectable number of new factions and armaments. Additionally, it fixes some significant flaws from the previous game, most importantly by avoiding the infuriating bugs that marred Arma II's single-player campaign. In short, it achieves almost everything that an expansion should and marks a new high point in a steadily improving franchise.     "
252,Pokemon Legends: Arceus,8.0,2,"In 1996, Pokemon was daring. The oddball RPG was both mechanically simpler and more ambitious than its contemporaries, consisting of an approachable battle system and a huge roster of 150 adorable mascot characters. Since then, the core Pokemon games have mostly stuck to the pattern established by those first games, developing a sense of familiarity with steady, light iteration. Pokemon Legends: Arceus breaks that iterative pattern, attempting to establish a new foundation while borrowing bits and pieces from the main Pokemon games to create something new. The result is sometimes messy and doesn't always work, but its distinct qualities set it apart from the core series and ultimately elevate it.Though it's a spin-off, Pokemon Legends: Arceus isn't lending the Pokemon trappings to an entirely different set of mechanics like the Mystery Dungeon or Stadium series. Instead, this game reimagines Pokemon's core mechanics--finding and catching Pokemon and battling with them--within the new context of exploring vast 3D open spaces.Legends: Arceus takes place long before the modern games, at a time when Pokemon haven't become integrated into daily life as pets and pack animals. There is a sense that the wilderness here is dangerous and the villagers treat Pokemon like fearsome, wild beasts. The exception to this is the Survey Corps, a small band of burgeoning scientists working underneath the local security forces. When you drop into the world, the Survey Corps almost immediately recognizes your knack for its style of research and puts you to work.An ever-present rift in the sky appears to be driving Pokemon berserk, including larger-than-life sacred Pokemon that are given special reverence and protection by the local Diamond and Pearl tribes. As a stranger in a strange land with no other options, you join up with the Survey Corps in hopes of solving the mystery of the rift.The Survey Corps' day-to-day work is building the first Pokedex, a paperbound notebook that compiles all of the region's accumulated Pokemon knowledge. The Corps even has some basic knowledge of how to catch Pokemon, including how to build a rudimentary PokeBall out of found materials. Completing your Pokedex is always the goal of Pokemon games, but it's usually an incidental secondary goal to collecting new Pokemon in order to train them for battles. In Arceus, completing the Pokedex is front-and-center, reintroducing it as a pivotal goal that connects everything you do, including how you progress through the game.Though the process of completing the Pokedex involves similar mechanics to what's found in the mainline Pokemon games, Legends: Arceus makes it a bit more involved. You can see the Pokemon wandering free around the open environments, as in Sword and Shield's Wild area. But you don't necessarily need to do battle to engage them. You can quietly sneak up on them, approaching slowly while their back is turned or hiding in some tall grass, and toss a PokeBall at them. That's often enough to catch them, so you go through PokeBalls quickly--dozens in a single trip--building out your collection. You can also bait them using their favorite foods to distract them as you're creeping up behind them. If they do notice you, they might attack you--if need be, you can dodge-roll out of the way or just run from the area, but the only real defensive tools you have are the Pokemon you've already caught. In a pinch, you can toss them into the fray to initiate a battle.Altogether this central gameplay loop takes the ideas that were previously left to the imagination and obscured behind RPG mechanics in the mainline Pokemon games, and recontextualizes them to be more active and personal. It's possible that all those times you got into a random encounter in previous Pokemon games, the monster first targeted you, and you tossed out a PokeBall to protect yourself in battle, and the battle system approximated that idea by presenting it as a random encounter. But here, it's very literal. You're at risk of getting hurt by a wild creature and your little pocket monsters are the only reliable answer at your disposal. It's satisfying to finally actually feel the tension of a wild beast attacking you, and to unleash your own trained monster to protect you.The controls behind this binary approach--stealth vs. an outright attack, capturing vs. initiating a Pokemon battle--can be disorienting. The trigger button is used to toss whatever you have at the ready, and you toggle between a menu of PokeBalls and other objects like bait and a separate menu of caught Pokemon using the X button. It's fairly intuitive most of the time, cycling through your arsenal and then aiming a shot, but in the heat of the moment it's easy to waste a PokeBall when you meant to start a battle--or worse, to start a battle when you were trying to be sneaky.In a mainline Pokemon game, simply catching a Pokemon would fill out its Pokedex entry but that's not the case here. Since you're building the first Pokedex, and since the stealth-catch mechanic lends itself to quicker finds, completing a Pokedex entry involves completing a series of tasks. A Pokedex sheet will outline tasks--often with multiple tiers--like catching a certain number of a Pokemon, defeating a certain number, catching a number without being noticed, seeing it use a certain move, feeding them a number of times, and so on. Once you've completed a number of these tasks, you can turn in your findings and the Pokedex entry is considered complete.It's a remarkably flexible system that lets you play Pokemon your own way. If you love to do Pokemon battles, you can make almost all of your progress just fighting wild monsters. (I'll be exploring battles in more detail shortly). If you'd rather focus on stealth and barely engage with battles at all, that option is available too. At first, I found myself obsessively checking my Pokedex tasks and steering myself toward min-maxing completion, flipping through Pokedex pages looking for the ones I needed. But after a while, I found it was much more enjoyable to just wander the world stealth-catching and battling as I felt like it, and then letting the chips fall where they may for Pokedex completion.This also leads to a much different sense of party dynamics than a typical Pokemon game. Since you're catching Pokemon by the barrel-full and evolving Pokemon isn't necessarily needed to complete their Pokedex entries, there's less incentive to keep a core team of favorites on-hand and passively level them up throughout the game. I was hot-swapping my team in the field constantly by checking in at base camps, substituting any Pokemon that had been outclassed by a newer catch. But that means some of my old favorites, including my starter, have been sitting in cold storage for hours. I found myself missing that feeling of forming a special bond with my starter Rowlet and keeping him with me throughout the game.Sating these beasts is the most exciting the series has been in years.Unfortunately, campaign progress gating is also tied to completing Pokedex survey results. The Survey Corps awards star rankings that level up as you gain research points for completing tasks and filling out Pokedex entries. New environments open up as you progress through the story, but between each major story point, you need to rank up to the next star level. That meant that for the first few star ranks, I was stuck needing to go over areas I had already explored extensively, grinding to progress enough to proceed. Later in the game, once I gained access to a larger selection of environments--and had access to mounts that made new areas reachable--it was much easier to progress without feeling like I had to go back over a previous area with a fine-toothed comb.The battle system is possibly the most recognizable aspect from previous Pokemon games, with each Pokemon in Legends: Arceus only being able to equip a total of four moves at a time and all the usual rock-paper-scissors elemental match-ups intact. But needing to know the finer nuances to type matchups is deemphasized in Arceus, to the point where moves are just listed as Effective, Super Effective, Not Very Effective, and No Effect from the start. More recent Pokemon games have included this feature, and I appreciate the help as someone who does not have the brain-space to keep track of every move match-up, but it has previously kept those hints gated behind having completed a Pokedex entry. In Pokemon Legends: Arceus that rough edge is sanded down to be even smoother, since you'll see them listed right away, even the first time you ever encounter a new Pokemon.You can also get into an encounter against multiple Pokemon, sometimes just through sheer luck by starting a battle in the middle of a crowd of wild creatures. These moments can feel appropriately harrowing, since you can still only have one monster out at a time. And sometimes you'll simply run into Pokemon far above your level, including red-eyed ""Alpha"" Pokemon that are larger and more powerful than the average for their species. If you can catch them, they're essentially the apex predators of their type with the requisite stat bump.Adding a small but sometimes-vital wrinkle to the battle system is the option to make any of your attacks ""Agile"" or ""Strong"" style. An Agile attack sacrifices some strength for speed, which sometimes lets you attack twice before your opponent can respond. Conversely, a Strong attack will pack some extra punch, but it might slow you down enough that your opponent can act twice. An optional battle timeline shows when turns will occur, so you can see how swapping between Agile and Strong moves will affect the turn order. This adds an extra layer of creativity and strategy, especially once you start supplementing less effective attacks with Strong style because you want to inflict a status effect, or using Agile style on a Super Effective attack to finish an opponent off quickly. Your opponents can make their attacks Agile or Strong too, so it cuts both ways, increasing the number of variables you have to consider in the midst of a fight and making it that much more fulfilling when your strategy pays off with a victory.A series of boss battles called Frenzy battles are also a significant change from the Pokemon norm. These large-scale conflicts tie into the story, as you work with each Pokemon's caretaker ""Warden"" to learn what kinds of foods they like so you can make special Balms. You then go into a distinct arena where you have to dodge the rampaging Pokemon's attacks and hit it with Balms, only occasionally sending out your own Pokemon to stun it long enough that you can rapid-fire Balms at it. Sating these beasts by juggling the priorities of active dodging, looking for open opportunities to throw, and then mixing in traditional Pokemon battles is the most exciting the series has been in years.The Wardens and the leaders of their clans are standout personalities in Legends: Arceus, introducing a totally new cast of characters but keeping the focus relatively small. Pokemon games often have a fairly sprawling cast of friends, professors, gym leaders, Elite Four members, and the Champion, and we rarely get to know any of them particularly well. In Legends: Arceus, there are less than a dozen main characters, and we spend much more time with them, getting to know their personalities and how they clash with each other. There's not a massive amount of depth to the story and characters, but I still got attached to these cute anime kids.The world is presented similar to Breath of the Wild, but Legends: Arceus' distinctly separate zones don't quite match the sprawling openness of that Zelda game. They're still rather large, and it captures that same sense of wonder, but it's not the same level of an impressive technical feat. Pokemon Legends Arceus also seems to be straining against the technical limitations of the Nintendo Switch at times (I played on a Nintendo Switch OLED), even among these smaller environments. Pieces of world geometry pop in and out somewhat regularly, and bodies of water and the sky show telltale texture repetition that's hard not to notice. It's a testament to the quality of the game that those issues only slightly detracted from my enjoyment.Some of the new ideas in Arceus have rough edges, and it's slow to start before you get access to many environments and mounts. This is an awkward first step, and it was a big adjustment for me, a longtime fan of the series, to make. Once Pokemon Legends: Arceus finds its stride, though, it's the most daring and inventive the series has been in years, breaking apart the staid core and creating something new and exciting from its pieces."
77,The Last of Us,8.0,2," The Last of Us Part I's PS5 version was reviewed by Jake Dekker, while its PC port was reviewed by Alessandro Barbosa.too similar to the PS3 and PS4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5.But The Last of Us Part I is more than the sum of its parts. It's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago.The most obvious way The Last of Us Part I does this is with its visuals. The overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make The Last of Us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. I can feel the repressed pain in Joel, sense the pervasive hope in Marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in Ellie.These details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. Admittedly, these are also details that I've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. But the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. The writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas.What does recontextualize the characters is the existence of The Last of Us Part II. Joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and Ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in Part I all the more tragic. Even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in Part II, it makes the final moments of The Last of Us Part I tougher to swallow.What's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, I rarely questioned Joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. It's a testament to Naughty Dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what Joel's actions entailed--I wanted to protect Ellie at all costs. All those complicated feelings The Last of Us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when I wrapped up Part I.The gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. Aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and Joel is a bit easier to maneuver. He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history.The improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. Every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. The unpredictable AI makes for some harrowing firefights. Success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill.What really makes the AI so effective is its tenacity. Enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. They feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart.It helps that companion AI is much better, too. In the original, Ellie, Tess, and Bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. They couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see Ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic.Where The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. It was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. Naughty Dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. They are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn’t need them.The combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. This lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. It's a shame because Joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use.It's even harder to overlook given how impressive Part II's level design was. The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this ""remake"" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games.The biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone. It may have seemed like a minor mechanic in The Last of Us Part II, but it fundamentally changed the way I approached combat. Obviously, Part I was not designed with a crawling Joel in mind. There is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between Part I and Part II.However, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes The Last of Us Part I's achievements. The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. The environments are rich with details that add flavor to Joel and Ellie's journey.The most welcome addition to The Last of Us Part I is its impressive suite of accessibility features. Like The Last of Us Part II, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. You can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one.Additionally, The Last of Us Part I adds a ton of new unlockables in the Extras menu. Like in previous Naughty Dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. There's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. While none of this fundamentally changes the experience, I spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package.The most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. Naughty Dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of The Last of Us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original Factions mode didn't make the cut.Those looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. The permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of The Last of Us. It's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I.All these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever. Hot off the heels of the successful The Last of Us on HBO, the long-awaited port of the first game in Naughty Dog's acclaimed series has arrived on PC with disappointing results. Those who have waited over a decade since the game's original release on PS3, or anyone looking to replay the first chapter in Joel and Ellie's tale again on PC, will be let down by the game's overall performance, which manages to shine only on the most expensive and least used hardware on the market today.There are two fundamental issues that plague The Last of Us Part I on PC. First is VRAM (video memory found on your GPU) usage, and more specifically how much the game demands. Running at 1440p with Ultra settings, the game's expansive settings menu informed me that the 12GB of VRAM on my RTX 3080 Ti would not be enough, suggesting I drop settings like texture quality and filtering down to compensate. Ignoring the advice led to some consistent stuttering during gameplay, which, for a change, isn't down to shader compilation stutter. After first opening the game, you're subjected to a 45-minute-long shader compilation (which you'll have to do again after a graphics driver update or reinstallation), negatively impacting performance if you decide to play while this happens. But once that's complete, it meant that any stutters I did encounter were exclusively due to settings pushing past the recommended VRAM limits.That means, for a relatively powerful GPU like the RTX 3080 Ti, Ultra settings even at 1440p were off the table, which doesn't bode well for cards lower down the chain. The RTX 3070, a popular choice amongst PC gamers, only comes with 8GB of VRAM, which prevents you from playing The Last of Us Part I with anything higher than Medium texture settings, irrespective of resolution. I verified this using an RTX 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM, which doesn't perform equally to the RTX 3070 but has the exact same memory limitations. What's problematic about that is just how drastically different the game looks at these settings, with texture resolution and clarity taking a significant hit between High and Medium presets. It's so degraded that it's at a point where you're playing a far less visually impressive game when compared to its PlayStation 5 version, despite having more capable hardware.The second issue is CPU performance. The Last of Us Part I makes surprisingly great use of all the cores of your CPU, which isn't the norm in a sea of titles that are still so reliant on powerful single cores. What is baffling, and detrimental to performance, is just how much the game is using your CPU all the time, and how hard it is frequently each core in the least demanding scenarios. Near the opening hour of the game, I was standing in an empty alleyway with only two other NPCs in sight and zero interactions taking place. At this moment, The Last of Us Part I was hammering all 12 threads of my AMD Ryzen 5600X, with each one reporting over 80% usage. While moving around and engaging in combat, each thread was routinely hovering around 90-95% usage, touching 100% from time to time and limiting my overall frame rate as a result. Marvel's Spider-Man on PC is another CPU-heavy game, but in that situation it makes more sense, as you're moving fast through a large open world with loads more happening as you zip past traffic and pedestrians. And even then, I never saw CPU usage at half of what The Last of Us Part I was demanding during my time with Spider-Man. The Last of Us Part I's CPU usage is currently out of control, and you'll probably find yourself CPU-limited in numerous scenarios even if you have the latest GPU to push past its other issues.It's a shame that playing The Last of Us Part I right now on anything but a GPU with at least (and preferably more than) 12GB of VRAM is a severely limited experience--especially when compared to its stellar performance on Sony's own hardware--because this remake routinely establishes itself as one of the most visually captivating ports of a Sony title yet on PC. It's difficult to reconcile that this was once a game on two-generations-old console hardware, but if you have the graphical horsepower to show it off at its best, it's a marvel of gorgeous lighting, highly-detailed environments, and stunnings character modeling that is accentuated with additional PC settings that show the game off in a new, stunning light.The settings menu itself is extensive, with helpful previews that show how your changes are affecting the image and useful descriptions informing you of what parts of your PC you're helping by turning things down. The VRAM usage meter is helpful in reigning in settings that would otherwise cause irritating stutter, but it's also the facet of this menu that's most confusing. It features a section that suggests a portion of your VRAM is being locked up by other applications and your operating system, but the figure it reports doesn't correlate to actual usage. Even more confusing is that this figure scales according to how much VRAM you have in total, with 2.4GB being used on my 12GB RTX 3080 Ti and 1.5GB on my RTX 3050. There is no real way to bring it down, either, which may (or may not) be affecting overall VRAM usage by the game itself.This is something that should hopefully be addressed by future patches, along with a host of other performance improvements and optimizations to bring this port to a level of quality we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. It's disappointing after the relatively good work done on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection that The Last of Us Part I seems a long way away from being a smooth experience for most players. So if you've been waiting all these years to finally experience Joel and Ellie's story for the first time, it's probably best if you wait at least a little longer."
3543,Confidential Mission,5.0,1,"Hitmaker, the internal Sega development studio that brought you Crazy Taxi and Virtual On, has ported another of its arcade games to the Dreamcast. Confidential Mission is a light-gun game in the spirit of the Virtua Cop series, and you play as a debonair superagent who must stop an evil mastermind from using a hijacked satellite for the purposes of world domination. Unfortunately, Hitmaker's quirky sense of style and revising of existing formulas are all but absent from Confidential Mission, though it's doubtful these things could've saved the game from its well-worn premise. Confidential Mission is Virtua Cop with secret agents. Or, if that definition doesn't suit your fancy, you could describe it as House of the Dead 2 with secret agents. Either way, you already know how Confidential Mission is going to play out. With your camera on rails, you roll around levels, shooting evil henchmen as they pop out of doorways, slide across hallway floors, and jump up from behind crates. You will also encounter an occasional boss fight and a few midlevel minigames. Confidential Mission boasts branching level design, but this gimmick has little impact on how the game actually plays. It goes like this: A few times each level you are faced with a minigame-style challenge, such as shooting out the coupling pin between two train cars or clogging up exhaust ports spewing poisonous gas. Regardless of your success in these missions, you still have to shoot your way through a horde of thugs, though if you complete the minigame challenge, the scenery through the rest of the level will change slightly. The game's ultrasimple arcade control should, in theory, allow for a fast-paced, streamlined gaming experience, but there are some factors that hinder the gameplay. Designed as a light-gun game, Confidential Mission can still be played with a standard Dreamcast controller, but historically, a light-gun game without the light gun is the antithesis of fun, and this game is no different. Sega has neglected to release its first-party light gun in the US, and the Japanese Dreamcast light gun is incompatible with US games, so you're stuck with third-party light guns, whose quality and accuracy can be hit and miss. This is less the direct fault of the game than it is part of Sega's legacy of bad hardware decisions, but it undoubtedly has an impact on how much fun you can have with this game. As far as Dreamcast games go, Confidential Mission is graphically proficient. Most enemy models and environments are fairly simple in design, evoking the distinct polygonal look in other Sega NAOMI-based arcade games. The main characters are given more definition during real-time cutscenes, and there is never even a hint of slowdown through the length of the game.  The game's score is evocative of the James Bond theme as well as the Peter Gunn theme, though it borrows directly from neither. The game's music and sound effects are passable and generally uninteresting, but the crown jewel in Confidential Mission's aural presentation is the magnificently laughable voice acting. Much as in House of the Dead 2, long, dramatic pauses followed by a stilted ""oh no!"" or ""let's go through this door"" are the rule, not the exception. Some will appreciate the hammy, campy nature of the bad voice acting; others will reach for the mute button. If Sega's previous arcade light-gun games still hold appeal for you, this game may be right up your alley. However, those who have grown weary of rail-based light-gun action games will find little of value in Confidential Mission."
2977,Xenoblade Chronicles,9.0,2,"               punishes you for failing (even allowing you to avoid rewatching cutscenes should you die on a boss). It encourages experimentation, risk taking, and, most importantly, having fun.      A massive level of care and attention to detail is prevalent throughout the game, from the beautifully crafted environments to the excellent soundtrack. Even the inventory is filled with depth. There are numerous collectibles to find, which can be registered in the Collectopaedia (which leads to rewards), and each has its own unique description. There are hundreds of different types of armour, and your character's outfit changes based on what you have equipped. There are some repeated designs, but given the vast number available, it's barely noticeable. They differ based on the character they're equipped on too, so one armour type looks entirely different on Shulk than on someone else. You might spend hours managing your inventory, not because the game forces you to, but because it's enjoyable. Many pieces of equipment have gem slots, and gems can be found or crafted. These provide buffs for a multitude of stats, boosting attack or defence, or giving an increase to a more passive statistic. It's possible to tinker with character builds for hours, but again, the game never forces this upon you; it's just there if you really want to delve in as deep as possible.        Finding fault with Xenoblade Chronicles is not an easy task, but it's not without the occasional downside. Despite the intricately modelled outfits, character faces are bland and have a tendency to look a bit false, with Shulk's face in particular having the appearance of makeup painted on an egg. Occasionally, finding where to go can be a bit of a headache. The map is uncovered as you go, and the quest marker arrow points directly to your objective, but it does so without taking the layout of the land into account, so an objective may require you to circle around a cliff, for instance, when the arrow gives the impression that you can head in another direction. In a game where exploration is so rewarding, though, it's a minor issue, and even if you intend to power through the story and ignore all the optional extras, it's a problem that crops up only a few times. All of these flaws are minor compared to the relative excellence of the rest of the game. The action controls better with the Classic Controller, but the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo is perfectly serviceable, although the lack of a second analogue stick means the camera can be a slight nuisance occasionally.    Chrono Trigger and the other Xeno titles--it's a hugely surprising, versatile game. It has everything that seasoned JRPG veterans are looking for, but it also manages to lift the barrier for entry for those new to the genre. It retains the traditions it wants to and modernises the aspects it needs to. It's not only one of the best JRPGs in years; it's also one of the best RPGs regardless of subgenre. Xenoblade Chronicles is a captivating, magical game which deserves to be hailed as the revolution it is.    "
78,MLB The Show 23,8.0,2,"Jackie Robinson is many things: a hall of fame baseball player; a Rookie of the Year, MVP, and World Series winner; and, most notably, the first Black man to break baseball's color line and compete in the Major Leagues. The legendary number 42 made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut in 1947 and lit up the diamond with his electric playstyle, all while facing intolerance and hatred from fans, opposing players, and teammates alike. Jackie Robinson's alluring talent was one of the reasons he was chosen to be the first Negro League player to integrate into the previously segregated Major Leagues, but it was his outstanding intangibles--such as his ability to handle racist abuse with grace--that sealed the deal. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, will tell you that Jackie Robinson wasn't the greatest player to ply his trade in the Negro Leagues. That's not to disparage one of the greatest players of all time, but to provide context for just how good some of the league's other players were.MLB The Show 23 shines a spotlight on these unknown and forgotten heroes of the Negro Leagues. A new Storylines mode explores the league's rich history, telling a captivating story of extraordinary people triumphing in the face of abhorrent prejudice and hate. It's a landmark moment for sports games--and video games in general--meshing The Show's consistently excellent gameplay with educational and inspiring video packages narrated by the extremely knowledgeable Kendrick himself. The rest of the game iterates on its predecessors and shakes up the Diamond Dynasty formula with some major changes, but it's Storylines: The Negro Leagues that stands out above all else and elevates the entire experience.Eight players are featured in this interactive learning tool: Leroy ""Satchel"" Page, Hilton Smith, Andrew ""Rube"" Foster, Hank Thompson, John Jordan ""Buck"" O'Neil, Jackie Robinson, John Donaldson, and Martin Dihigo. You may have only heard of one or two of these players, but every legendary figure has a whole series dedicated to their life and career, with each one spanning between eight and nine episodes.A single episode consists of a video package combining archival footage with eye-catching art that brings each player to life, and one or two gameplay scenarios that highlight what made them so special. These are similar to the Moments found in Diamond Dynasty, tasking you with completing different objectives such as striking out two batters or hitting a home run. They're usually fairly short, but the commentary adds additional trinkets about the players and the circumstances surrounding each moment, and the attention to detail in each one is fantastic. All of the authentic team uniforms and stadiums are featured, right down to the baggy pants and era-appropriate vehicles sitting in the parking lot. Even the crowds are dolled up, with men sporting ties and women wearing their finest dresses. The best teams often played each other on Sunday afternoons, so the capacity crowds would show up after church dressed in their Sunday best. These weren't just ballgames, but social occasions, and a venue for African-Americans to express themselves. It's great that this is reflected in the game.However, the moments that stand out the most are those that implement details learned from Kendrick's fascinating narration. In your first game pitching with Satchel Page, for instance, his repertoire consists of the usual fastballs and sliders. Yet this changes after you find out he had unique names for every pitch type he threw. In subsequent games, you choose to pitch from a selection including a bee, dipsy, and creep. It's a small detail, but one of the ways Storylines showcases Satchel's enormous personality. The best of these is when he makes a point of striking out the side after a white opposing player insults him with a racial epithet. The kicker is that he does so after instructing the entire defense to huddle around the mound; such was his confidence that the hitters wouldn't be able to make contact with his electrifying stuff.Baseball is a sport full of history and mythology, and you can see how Kendrick relishes in recounting the myths surrounding these players while also delving into the facts. His stories are as much about baseball as they are about civil rights, and the way he tells them is both captivating and highly illuminating. This might be the first time you'll hear about Negro League teams having to take grueling 24-hour bus rides to away games, not knowing if they'd be able to find a place to eat or a hotel to stay in because of their skin color. In the modern game, Shohei Ohtani is rightfully lauded for being an All-Star at the plate and on the mound, with many proclaiming that such a feat hasn't occurred since Babe Ruth graced the diamond, yet the Negro Leagues were full of exceptional two-way stars--including Martin Dihigo, who was not only a pitcher but also played every single position on the field.Storylines: The Negro Leagues draws attention to players who were lionized by their communities because of their ability to excel and overcome the limits imposed on them by systemic racism. These eight Black baseball pioneers are some of the best the sport has ever known, yet knowing who they are is a rarity for so many. The Show 23 is hopefully a marker for change, because the Negro Leagues are an integral part of both baseball and American history, and the people involved deserve to have their stories told.You can even match them up against modern stars, as completing each player's series unlocks a 90-rated version of them for use in Diamond Dynasty. The long-running card-collecting mode remains one of the best iterations of its type. Microtransactions are still present, but Sony San Diego continues to move further away from this gross practice cementing itself at Diamond Dynasty's core. There are dozens of ways to collect and build a team of your favorite players just by playing the game, whether they're legends from the past or current superstars--from mini-seasons and showdowns to conquest maps and online ranked matches.The big change this year is a shift to seasonal teams, which breaks the traditional power curve by introducing 99-rated cards right out of the gate. Throughout the year, seasons will cycle out cards to ensure that squads are kept fresh. For instance, you can currently earn World Baseball Classic-themed cards, but once Season 3 starts on July 7, these players won't be available to use in modes like Conquest and ranked matches. Instead, there will be new cards to unlock and use, ensuring that you won't end up facing the same two pitchers throughout the game's lifespan, as was the case last year. It's a divisive change, but one that will make for more diverse teams while also letting you earn powerful cards much earlier than before.The addition of team captains also makes it viable to build theme teams, as new Captain cards will boost particular players. If you set someone like newly added legend Derek Jeter as captain and put him on a team with other Captain Series hitters, they'll all receive boosts to various attributes. Currently, this ties into mini-seasons, where you can compete with theme teams to earn specific rewards. One requires you to build a squad like the one mentioned above, while the other challenges you to construct a team comprised of nothing but lefties. This incentivizes you to use players you might not otherwise consider and should keep mini-seasons feeling fresh throughout the year.Once you step up to the plate or settle in on the mound, The Show 23 still plays a fantastic game of baseball. Tweaks to the Button Accuracy throwing meter create a greater disparity between good and great fielders, while also factoring in the difficulty of each throw. Previously, the meter was consistent, with the accurate green zone always appearing in the middle. This made it easy to hurl pinpoint throws each time, but now the green zone will dynamically move and shrink to account for tough infield plays and long outfield throws. Fielding is more engaging as a result, and this adds to the game's authenticity as you'll definitely see more throwing errors this time around. The outfield also feels somewhat bigger. This is taken from a small sample size, but so far, doubles are much more prevalent than home runs in The Show 23. The long ball was perhaps too frequent last year, but now the pendulum seems to have swung the opposite way. This isn't a bad thing, although Moments that task you with hitting bombs can drag when fly balls continuously die at the warning track.Franchise mode is much the same as before, aside from the addition of an overhauled scouting system. Each week before the draft, you're able to assign three scouts to scout a specific prospect, a single position, or unearth players who aren't even on your draft board yet. Prospect generation is much improved this year. Previously, draft classes included far too many older players, but each draft now contains players in the range of 18 to 23 years old, with most of them erring on the younger side. Scouting a player gives you a rough estimate of their attributes and potential, but you won't know a player's true rating until after you draft and sign them.This mimics reality to some degree since very few prospects are a sure thing. You could draft the next great superstar or end up with a player who never even steps foot in the majors. The MLB draft slot and signing bonus system have also been added to the game, so even after you've drafted a player you still need to sign them to a deal before the deadline passes, forcing you to consider their interest level and potential signing bonus amount before drafting them. All of this makes the draft a much more exciting proposition, although the same can't be said for Road to the Show, which adds little more than a few new presentational flourishes.After feeling like the series was treading water for the past couple of years, MLB The Show 23 sees Sony San Diego introduce some significant additions to its baseball sim. Road to the Show has still been neglected, but incremental gameplay improvements slightly enhance the on-field action, and Franchise has received a long-overdue shot in the arm with its expanded scouting system. The new seasonal structure to Diamond Dynasty should also make for a more interesting mode throughout the course of the year, and Storylines: The Negro Leagues is worth the price of admission alone. It may not move the needle in every area, but MLB The Show 23 is another deep sports title that will keep you busy long into October and beyond."
4789,Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero,3.0,0," If Globalstar Software's PC platform-action game Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero had been released three to five years ago, it would've been easy to compare it unfavorably with better games that had come out around then, like Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and Abuse. But it's been three years since Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and five since Abuse--to say nothing of Sega's excellent Sonic Adventure games for the Sega Genesis console and Nintendo's outstanding Super Mario World for the SNES console--and the recently released Akimbo is vastly inferior to any of these other games. So it's not just a bad game; it's also thoroughly outdated, which makes Akimbo's 2001 release for the PC--on which platform-action games have never been popular--all the more baffling. In fact, calling Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero a lousy platform-action game would be an insult to lousy platform-action games everywhere.   If you happen to see Akimbo on the shelves at your local computer game store, you might be intrigued by the distinctive Japanese anime look of the game's box. But once you install the game, the closest thing you'll find to authentic anime graphics are the game's crudely drawn loading screens. The game itself is a 2D side-scrolling platformer that stars the titular hero, Akimbo. Akimbo is represented by a fairly well-animated prerendered sprite, as are some of the enemies Akimbo finds, such as goggle-eyed clams, goggle-eyed spiders, and goggle-eyed mosquitoes. However, the worlds that Akimbo explores are simplistic hand-drawn 2D backdrops that look like nothing more than grainy scanned-in drawings made with colored-ink markers.   Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero sounds no better than it looks. The game's music is upbeat, but it's so simplistic and repetitive that it becomes annoying quickly--thankfully, you can turn it off. Akimbo's other sound effects are apparently intended to be ""cute."" In addition to running, Akimbo himself can jump and perform a few martial-arts attacks to fight his enemies. When he does either, he emits a nasal, high-pitched shout or grunt. And when Akimbo dies (and he tends to quite often), he either cries out in pain or, if he's fallen into a pit, emits a high-pitched squeal. Most of his enemies also make similarly ""cute"" noises, too.   Unfortunately, Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero's poor graphics and sound are the best things about it, because the game itself plays horribly. The game's controls are only partially responsive: You can jump small gaps rather easily, as Akimbo responds quickly to jump input and ""floats"" slightly with each jump. But he runs and turns sluggishly, and he may run into an enemy or fall into a pit because he didn't stop running in time. In fact, it's a little too easy to die in Akimbo: Kung-Fu Hero. A single touch from an enemy or a drop into a pit kills Akimbo, and the game's inconsistent control, bad level design, and poor hit detection (enemies that seem a safe distance away will sometimes kill Akimbo anyway) ensure that you do in fact die, and quite often. What's more, even though the game doesn't have an actual time limit in which you must solve a level, it has something that's perhaps even more frustrating: a ""food meter."" Akimbo must continually collect food items to survive, and though food is often plentiful in most levels, every so often you'll come across a poorly designed puzzle that requires multiple tries to solve, and before you can finish it, you'll run out of food and fall over dead. You start each game with four lives, and when you lose them all, you may continue, but only after you get booted back to the game's main menu and reselect the level you were playing. It's an annoying process that takes entirely too long, and it happens far too often.   Though there are quite a lot of them, Akimbo's levels just aren't enjoyable to play through. You'll find that most of the game's levels have parts that are alternately far too easy or maddeningly difficult. And whatever difficulty you find won't be from interesting and enjoyable challenges, it'll be from trying to reach a ledge that's just beyond your jumping range or from a pit that must be traversed using a specific item that you'll need to spend extra time trying to acquire.   It's possible that Akimbo's bright colors and cute characters might prove to be enough of a distraction for very, very, very young players who don't know enough about games to expect responsive controls, decent level design, or good gameplay, especially if they don't mind dying and restarting repeatedly. However, if you're over the age of 10, you'll probably find Akimbo to be both too simplistic and too frustrating to play--especially if you've played other, better platform-action games like Abuse, Jazz Jackrabbit, or any of Sega's Sonic Adventure games or Nintendo's Super Mario games.    	  "
3762,Monster Garage,5.0,1," Those who regularly watch the Discovery Channel will undoubtedly know the name Monster Garage. It's the show where motorcycle guru Jesse James and his team transform a vehicle into a functional machine with a purpose. It's no surprise that the fun, dynamic show would make its way onto video games. Unfortunately, the PC version released earlier this year was a travesty, due to its lack of strategic gameplay, poor design, and stability issues. Ten months later, an overhauled Monster Garage has turned up on the Xbox. The Xbox version yields mixed results: It makes numerous improvements but it also takes away some of the freedom offered in the PC version.      The Monster Garage TV show works like this: Jesse James and a group of specialists are given a task. For example, they may have to convert an RV into a mobile skate ramp or a Porsche into a golf ball retriever. It's not that easy, though. The team has to complete the project in seven days and they are only given a budget of $3,000. Fortunately, the team is able to sell unused parts stripped from the vehicle to earn extra cash. Unlike the PC version, the Xbox version gives you seven brand-new challenges (plus a bonus challenge) with the same rules, except now you have $5,000 to spend. The challenges, such as the flying car or the tank, aren't something that you're likely to ever see in real-life Monster Garage, so they're actually quite fun to see in the game.   Each challenge in the game is split into four phases: design, construction, decoration, and trial. Day one is solely devoted to reviewing the design. You can only use one design in the Xbox version, whereas you had multiple choices in the PC version. The removal of choices really hurts the game because there is no incentive to rebuild any of the monsters once you finish each one. Days two through six are spent chopping up the vehicle, ordering materials, creating custom parts, and attaching parts to the monster. You click on a team member and you will get a list of tasks he or she can perform. Each task will take a certain amount of time, and adding or subtracting parts from the vehicle also eats up the time. On day seven, you are allowed to customize your monster with paint jobs and decals. When you're finished, you'll actually get to drive your monster.      And that's all Monster Garage has to offer. It truly is as straightforward as it sounds. That's because each challenge has a paint-by-the-numbers approach. There is only one way to build the monster. You can't cut any corners. You can't construct something cool on your own. Nope, Jesse is going to build a roll cage the same way every time. If you get stumped, you can review the part-by-part blueprint video on how to build the monster so there's no mystery about what you need. In the PC version, you could install parts in any order, so sometimes you would make an error if you weren't paying attention. In the Xbox version, you can't install a part out of order. It makes the game less tricky because you won't incur time penalties from reinstalling parts in the correct order. The Xbox version also has no mystery about what parts you'll need to fabricate. You can click on any team member immediately to find out what you'll need to make, so you can jot down all the raw materials you need and then order them immediately. Again, this removes any guesswork from the game by holding your hand throughout the entire process.   The biggest improvement in the Xbox version is with the team members. You'll be randomly assigned three team members for each challenge (Jesse James is always on the team). The team members all have varying statistics, so one person may be better at welding than the others. There still isn't any direct interaction from team members--you'll never see any person-to-person conversation, or see anyone walking around in the shop. But there are some random events that occur. For instance, we had team members who didn't show up for work one morning, and some guys said that they had gotten into an argument with Jesse and left for a few hours. These added touches are nice, but they hardly affect the gameplay. The varying times for job completion between team members don't make a difference in the long run because you can complete jobs well before the deadline in all the challenges. We also never had anyone leave the garage if they were working on a job. The result is that we never had any time pressure to get the job done, and as such, we never had to restart a challenge due to running out of time.    Another improvement in the game is with attaching or removing parts. You now have the option to manually or automatically remove parts. Manual removal brings up a close-up view of the part, where you must either weld along a line or fasten a few bolts to attach the piece (or cut a line or loosen a few bolts to remove it). Eventually, doing these tasks over and over gets repetitive. Fortunately, you can now automatically remove parts instead, although you'll sacrifice time to do so. A manual removal may take five minutes of in-game time, while automatic removal will take 20 minutes. The manual removal times appear to be more realistic, as opposed to automatic removal times, which are exaggerated. The solution between the two options is that you may want to juggle between the two to manage your time. But as mentioned, you'll never be pressed for time so the extra time of automatic removal won't hurt you. Even so, the automatic removal is a nice addition because it makes the game less monotonous.       Once you've built your monster, you'll get to test it in a driving simulation. In the Xbox version, all seven of your driving portions take place in the same arena. The trick is that some parts of the arena are closed off by obstacles at the start. Later challenges will allow you to build machines that can destroy these obstacles, opening up the arena as you progress. It's a nice idea and it works pretty well within the game. The machines are also fun to use. You'll be able to fling bowling balls with the slingshot machine and break glass panes with the glider. The actual driving is functional, but not great. It can take a while to get used to the controls, especially because the camera is difficult to handle in some challenges. You can also spend a lot of time finding where you need to go next because you don't have a map.   Monster Garage is Xbox Live-enabled, but you won't be directly challenging your buddies online. Instead, there is an online scoreboard that tracks your time spent in the garage and on the challenge field. There are two categories: all-time and monthly scoreboards. It almost seems pointless to have build-time scoreboards because there is an obvious critical path in building the monster. You may have finished fabricating all your parts, yet you will be waiting for one part to arrive before you can complete the monster. Therefore, scoreboards will fill up with people who complete the build in the set amount of time. The challenge scoreboards are a different story, because it takes some skill to drive and do the tasks. The Xbox Live scoreboards may cause some people to challenge the best times of others, but ultimately it won't have enough long-lasting appeal to cause players to come back to the game.      Monster Garage on the Xbox looks better than the PC version, but that's not saying much. The menus and inventory screens are set up nicely, but the game still looks bland graphically, both inside and outside the shop. There is very little detail, and the driving area has low-resolution textures. Your vehicles take no damage when driving around the course, making you wonder why you had to install driver protections. The audio is equally disappointing. Team members get excited when you give them a task (""This is going to be so cool!""), and then sound like it was the worst thing in the world when they finish it (""That took forever. Next time give me something easy to do.""). The music tracks are limited as well. The shop sounds, like torches and power tools, are appropriate, at least.   There really isn't much to keep you playing Monster Garage for long, since the game will take you three to four hours to complete. The challenges are all easy to build and drive. That's unfortunate because some of the challenges in the PC version were difficult despite its shortcomings. Even though it's bad that the game doesn't offer any alternative designs, you can't fault the linear approach it takes to building the monster. Obviously you need to install parts in a given order in construction, but the game can still be at fault for being so inflexible with the parts themselves. Why does the Xbox version practically tell you the order of the parts to be installed? Why can't I build a roll cage with fewer crossbeams in order to save money? If the in-game engine included damage modeling, you could have considered the consequences of this trade-off. Was saving a few bucks really worth the risk of damaging the vehicle in the trial? You should ask yourself that same question in regards to the game. Is saving a few bucks worth it to avoid a simple game with no replayability? We think so.  "
1205,Space Hulk: Deathwing,4.0,0,"Of all the issues, tedium is the biggest offender. All nine levels of the campaign are slogs where you trudge down one corridor after another, pausing only to incinerate predictable waves of enemies. Beyond a few minor variations, enemy Genestealers come in two forms: ones that rush at you gnashing teeth and slashing claws, and hybrids that shoot at you from a distance with guns, rocket launchers, and psychic blasts. Bigger and tougher baddies are introduced during the campaign--including some bosses capable of shredding squads with ease--but by and large, the tactics you employ at the start of the game will carry you to the end.On a positive note, battles are often as brutal as you'd expect from a Space Hulk game. There’s real weight to the thud of your weaponry and power armor as you stomp through dark corridors and chambers. Even the thump-thump-thump of the (relatively) lightweight storm bolter, the whir of an assault cannon, and the whoosh of a flamer are exhilarating because you feel like you’re doing real physical damage. Pounding on enemies with melee weapons is even more ferocious, if a bit chaotic and hard to follow, with the medieval-styled swords and hammers that send flurries of blood and flesh into the air.Deathwing thankfully nails the look and atmosphere of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It's loaded with visual fan service like massive cathedrals, dissected bodies in laboratories, and humans wired into power systems. Everything is just as baroque and bloody as it ought to be, making for one of the most authentic video game interpretations of Warhammer 40,000's striking aesthetic."
303,Sable,9.0,2,"The titular Sable is part of a nomadic tribe known as the Ibexii. Like every child who comes of age on the planet of Midden, Sable must leave her clan behind and embark on a rite of passage called The Gliding. This involves venturing out into the wider world on a pilgrimage to learn more about themselves, the land they inhabit, and the people that populate Midden's sun-scorched sand dunes. Like those before her, Sable is bestowed a hoverbike and a Gliding Stone before leaving, the latter of which allows her to float through the air using an energy bubble born from ancient technology. With this, the stage is set for an open-world adventure that's equal parts relaxing and engrossing.At its core, Sable is a game about exploration, with its mechanics and overall design all feeding into this central philosophy. Upon departing the Ibexii camp for the first time, you're free to straddle your hoverbike and venture off towards any of the four corners of Sable's vast but manageably-sized map. There are quests to complete along the way that maintain some semblance of order, but this is a freeform open-world game that disregards the genre's traditional objective structure. Generally, your compass will point you in the vague direction of your current quest, while at other times you'll be given directions that encourage you to discover locations for yourself. You can set your own waypoints by using the map or by finding a vantage point and using the Navigator to mark potential points of interest, and all of these are displayed on the compass that encircles your hoverbike. Crucially, you never have to stare at a mini-map or a big objective marker as you skim inches above the sand, and this keeps your eyes planted firmly on what's in front of you.If you're heading towards a particular location with your eyes on the horizon, you're likely to spot other distractions along the way, whether it's a plume of smoke billowing into the sky and hinting at signs of life or the battered husk of a crashed spaceship. This kind of organic discovery is often found lacking in open-world games that rely on pre-existing points of interest and maps scattered with markers, and it sets Sable apart as you chart the world yourself by venturing towards whatever catches your eye. Midden is a fascinating world to uncover, too, with small pockets of civilization nestled in between the serene desolation of its sprawling desert. There are dilapidated temples engulfed by sand, a graveyard full of gargantuan animal bones, and an eerie forest shrouded in perpetual darkness--to name just a few of the sights you'll come across throughout your travels.Sable's striking and distinctive visual design is a significant contributor to this wondrous sense of discovery, painting the landscape with clean black lines that accentuate details where they matter, letting those that don't fade into the background as the linework loosens up. Its cel-shaded art style is inspired by the late French artist Jean Giraud, and each frame looks like it could've been lifted from one of the science-fiction comic books he illustrated under the Moebius pseudonym. There's a day/night cycle that substantially alters the mood, as the vibrant and warm colors of a sweltering afternoon are gradually drained out and replaced by the muted blues and oranges of midnight. You only need to glance at a couple of screenshots to see how gorgeous it looks, and it's even better in motion. Sable's stop motion-esque animation is evocative of both animated movies and one of those old flipbooks, capturing the spirit of childhood adventure.Breath of the Wild is another inspiration that permeates throughout Sable, from its focus on exploration to the way you traverse the world. Almost every surface is scalable; the only thing regulating how far you can climb is a stylized stamina meter that floats around your head. This freedom liberates you to explore until your body isn't physically able to, with Sable's primary challenge revolving around finding the most efficient route to scale each obstacle. With the Gliding Stone in tow, you're also able to soar across chasms and weave past jagged outcroppings and ancient structures. Platforming can be a tad finicky at times--whether it's because the camera is blocked or because it takes Sable more than a few attempts to attach to a specific surface--but for the most part, this free-climbing adds an engaging and satisfying challenge to a game without any combat or fail states.There's also some light puzzle-solving involved that'll have you rerouting power to create platforms and rotating enormous relics to access locked tombs. None of this is particularly taxing, and some of the puzzles are rather bland, but they're generally quite short and do offer worthwhile rewards. You can always ignore these detours completely, of course, since Sable's quest design adheres to the same ethos as its traversal, giving you the flexibility to approach it however you want. There's a loose end goal to aim for, but how and when you reach that point is entirely up to you.Part of The Gliding and its coming-of-age journey is all about discovering who you want to be when you finally return to your tribe. Masks are a part of everyday life in Midden, with each one representing a different profession that comes with its own cultural meanings and source of pride. By completing various quests, impressing people, or helping them out of sticky situations, you'll gradually earn badges relating to these vocations. Playing hide and seek with a group of kids, for example, will earn you an entertainer badge, while trading with merchants will net you a merchant badge. Once you own three of one particular type of badge, you can visit one of the mysterious Mask Casters and they'll craft them into a mask. The game ends once you've returned to the Ibexii tribe with one or more of these masks, whether you've crafted a single one or the entire collection.Some of the quests adopt the rote ""collect x amount of y"" template, but at least gathering these materials is more interesting than usual since the game leans on its strong sense of exploration. Other quests are more elaborate, yet the strength of Sable's quests lies in their cohesion and propensity to flow into one another. You might be asked to deliver three bugs to a town in the north, only to become entangled in an investigation to find out who stole the town's power generator once you get there. From there, your quest log is likely to expand, and since there's no binary distinction between ""primary"" quests and ""side"" quests, it all feels important.The writing is a strong point, too, namely because it's relatively understated. These characters are just regular people going about their lives, and this is reflected in their personable dialogue. Conversations are warm and oftentimes funny, while Sable's inner voice sees the world through a kind and descriptive lens that breathes life into the perpetually masked. The presence of dialogue choices also gives you an opportunity to tailor her personality in small but poignant ways. This might take the form of reassuring one of the Ibexii children, who's scared of losing you to the wider world, or proclaiming that you've never felt freer when meeting a fellow adventurer.Unfortunately, Sable isn't without its faults. These are mostly technical or related to the UI, such as the fact that it's impossible to keep track of merchants. There is a fast travel system, so you can at least dart between different settlements at the click of a finger, but finding the right vendor feels like an unnecessary chore at times. When it comes to technical issues, performance is the main culprit. On the PC version, slowdown and stuttering are frequent nuisances throughout, especially when cruising the open world on your hoverbike. Developer Shedworks says it's working on a patch that should be available in a few weeks, so there is at least a silver lining.Bounding over sand dunes on the hoverbike is a joyous experience despite these distractions. Getting back on it after dismounting can be needlessly time-consuming, however. You can recall the bike as though it were a horse, but rather than teleport wherever you're not looking, it has to physically make its way towards you. Sometimes it simply doesn't show up, while other times you'll find it snagged on a piece of geometry. It's easy enough to find using the compass, but having to fetch the bike yourself presents a hassle where there shouldn't be one.Sable is a little rough around the edges, then, yet these shortcomings are far outweighed by its numerous strengths. This is a relaxing adventure that's both familiar and quite unlike anything else. It gives you the freedom to approach things at your own pace--in your own way--while managing to dispel any notions of aimlessness. Even if you don't have a particular objective in mind, you're guaranteed to discover new sights and sounds by hopping on your hoverbike and simply exploring. It's the antithesis to most open-world design, where the onus is on getting you to the next point of interest as soon as possible, and so it stands out even if you remove its beautiful art style from the equation. Sable is methodical, introspective, comforting, and fully deserving of your time."
105,Forspoken,5.0,1,"In Forspoken, protagonist Frey finds herself trapped in the magic-filled world of Athia after stumbling through a portal. There, she bonds with a sentient brace she nicknames Cuff and then encounters a group of survivors living in the last city that's free from the effects of a dangerous miasma. This blight, which Frey calls the Break, covers the land and transforms living creatures into mutated monsters. Frey is the only exception, making her an ideal candidate for exploring the Break, finding its source, and destroying it. The whole situation is an intriguing narrative setup but boring or unlikable characters let it down. It's difficult to like the standoffish and stubborn Frey, the incessantly sarcastic Cuff (who regularly quips in Frey's ear like a discount JARVIS), or any of the survivors who are all too eager to completely rely on Frey's protection from the Break while also asking her to complete boring optional tasks like going on a tour of a lifeless hub or petting a bunch of sheep.Forspoken's story is one about belonging--finding a place you want to stay and a people you wish to protect. Like any isekai protagonist worth their salt, Frey is initially resistant to her new surroundings before discovering that she's actually ideally suited to the world she's found herself trapped in. However, it's not a world that the game is able to adequately convince the player of wanting to stay in and protect. The emotional connection Forspoken tries to establish to incentivize the player to take action--to help the people that need Frey's help--is deeply uninteresting and oftentimes head-scratching and odd. The characters don't take the threat of Athia's imminent destruction very seriously and any tension that comes from their perilous existence is repeatedly undermined by meaningless busywork they want you to do. The characters themselves are also incredibly plain with two-dimensional personalities. They have no real convictions or anything interesting to say.The facial expressions of the people in Athia are stilted and uncomfortable, which already creates a bit of a disconnect with the emotional core of Forspoken's story. But the issue is exacerbated by how these people are characterized and used to inspire Frey. We see Frey contemplate murderous vengeance over the death of a survivor she'd only just met, and feel guilty over belittling someone she has the slimmest of connections to. These people aren't fleshed out in Forspoken's story, and so the way they emotionally manipulate Frey isn’t all that believable or fulfilling to watch. My playthrough was filled with me constantly asking, ""Yes, but why should Frey care?"" and Forspoken never delivered a satisfying answer to the question.With not much keeping you within the last bastion of human life in Athia, you're encouraged to go out and explore the wider world, sprinting over fields with Frey's parkour abilities and blasting enemies away with explosive magic. Frey zips through the environment with stylish flips and jumps, moving so quickly that she skids to a halt. This does create an enjoyable fluidity to movement and it's exhilarating to feel the world speed past you. Still, the lack of precision makes platforming or levels within enclosed spaces frustratingly difficult. More than a few times, I found myself accidentally jetting past an item I wanted to pick up, or unintentionally racing up the wall of a building. Technically, you can instantly shut off Frey's magical parkour by pressing the button that puts her into a normal sprint--apparently, the two actions cancel each other out because using them both at once causes Frey to come to an abrupt halt. It's an awkward workaround to the problem, however, and not one easy to pull off in the midst of a fight.Whereas Forspoken's movement mechanics encourage a wilder, freeform style of engaging with the world, combat pushes you toward precision. There's a precise timing needed to pull off dodges and parries, and several of Frey's magic spells lend themselves to careful placement and strategic use--that's difficult to do when racing around the environment. As a result, Forspoken feels disjointed as the moments of exploration and navigation come into conflict with combat. Instead of complementing each other, these two parts of the game are actively fighting one another. They never come together into a cohesive whole.Frey can let loose a wide variety of bombastic spells and magical abilities, all of which are visually impressive displays. She can crush enemies with massive boulders, engulf whole groups in a molten eruption, or fry everything around her with brilliant green lightning. It all looks very cool, but there's not much in the way of strategy to it. Cuff can inform Frey what flavor of her magic is most effective against a particular enemy, and then all you have to do is switch to that element and keep tossing out attacks. Early into the game, you encounter enemy types that encourage you to think a bit beyond that--enemies who can block magic from the front or foes who can't be damaged until you destroy their wings, for example--but they only really appear in the first quarter of the story. After that, most enemies are bullet sponges designed to create challenge in how much of a magical beating they can take. It's not hard to switch magic types to mindlessly exploit weaknesses and so combat--though visually impressive--quickly loses all sense of enjoyment.Forspoken's movement is far more fun, especially in the latter half of the game when you start unlocking and chaining new mechanics that increase the variety of ways that Frey can journey across Athia, like slingshotting herself through the air with a flaming whip or manipulating gravity to skate across the water. Even if there's nowhere interesting to go in Forspoken--its open world is dotted with an assortment of run-of-the-mill side quests like time-limited parkour challenges and photo ops--there's fun to be had in the act of simply getting to your next main story mission. The quiet hum of Forspoken's excellent soundtrack worms its way into your ears while you're racing through the empty, yet beautiful, landscapes. I'm absentmindedly humming its main theme even now.Exposition regularly cuts into the experience, however. Frey and Cuff quip a lot, and though Cuff does have a few humorous one-liners and insightful commentary on the world of Athia over the course of the story, Frey...does not. Frey is one of the weakest parts of Forspoken. Her characterization resembles the narrative arc of '90s and early 2000s isekai light novels, manga, and anime, which largely focused on female protagonists becoming trapped in another world. There, they'd discover their innate talents translated into power, which they'd wield in a quest that awarded them personal agency and self-confidence. But Frey deviates from these isekai protagonists. She's inherently unlikable for most of Forspoken's story, with the game forcing her through her transformation from selfish sorcerer to defiant hero over the course of a single chapter of lengthy exposition. I didn't buy into her heroic shift in the final moments of the game--it felt like the storyline was going through the motions without taking the necessary steps to ensure Frey's emotional and mental development made sense.As a character, Frey feels flat. Our introduction to her is seeing her on the wrong side of a criminal court case, and that she views the world around her with jaded exasperation--she pushes people away because she's an abandoned orphan and believes no one wants her. Frey carries that disposition throughout most of the game and it's the primary means by which she views every aspect of Athia, and thus we the player are able to see it. Forspoken doesn't do anything to celebrate Frey as someone who is Black or a woman or anything else about her. The game posits that the only perspective worth noting from Frey is that of an orphan and that restriction not only stunts the character growth she can achieve, it also just gets stale after a few hours.Forspoken is a tricky game to recommend. The lore of its world is interesting but delivered in a stilted expository manner, and the freeing sensation of taking off across the landscape in a magically-propelled sprint is sullied by the knowledge that there's nowhere to go or anything fun to do. Combat is visually impressive but not all that engaging, and the excellent sound design and the catchy musical score are regularly undermined by unfunny quips from an unlikable protagonist. I enjoyed parts of it, but too often my fun was dragged to an unrewarding halt."
2440,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate,7.0,2,"   Lords of Shadow, and then you set out as his grandson, the crimson-clad Simon Belmont. Once Simon arrives at Dracula's throne, the game switches perspectives, putting you in the shoes of the mysterious Alucard, and eventually Trevor Belmont, Simon's father. The start of each act cascades back in time, leading up to the events of the act before it.     Despite its predictability, the story puts an interesting twist on the tale of the fabled Belmont clan. Traditionally, generations of Belmonts have faced off against Dracula in a never-ending battle to save humanity, with very little character development along the way. Mirror of Fate boldly reverses this trend, completely rewriting the Belmonts' history in the process. The notion of telling the story in reverse is as promising as it is unorthodox, but it needs to be handled delicately to work. By revealing big clues early in the game, Mirror of Fate fails to do so. Granted, the details of the plot are interesting, connecting characters in unprecedented ways that upset pre-Lords of Shadow lore, but these surprises, intended for the end of the game, are apparent too early into your adventure.     Every character possesses different skills and secondary items, but they all wield a whip of sorts. With their trusty lashes, they can conquer pretty much anything. Secondary items and magic are somewhat underutilized, and you're only forced to use them on rare occasions. Your primary weapon is often the most effective tool in battle, and like any good battle system, some attacks are better than others for a particular enemy-type. Discovering the right formula for a quick, painless kill is challenging, but the reward of impressive displays of might and speed are worth the time it takes to get it right.       Your weapon is quite useful outside of combat, too, aiding your progress into the castle depths. When grappling across chasms, or rappelling down walls, you need a keen sense of spatial awareness and timing to keep your footing and health in check. Fending off monsters while navigating precarious platforms builds tension, and they are the best moments Mirror of Fate has to offer, but since time is the only element at risk due to an overabundance of checkpoints and a generous revival scheme, the game lacks the invigorating urgency that the threat of death can deliver.     When you aren't confronted with throngs of enemies or tricky platforming sections, you might struggle with some of the environmental puzzles strewn throughout the castle. While it may seem like arranging mirrors to direct a laser around a series of twists and turns isn't the most logical way of powering on a contraption from the middle-ages, it's a mildly challenging diversion and a welcome change of pace. The few puzzles in the game are generally well designed, but they primarily task you with finding the appropriate arrangement for a series of objects. They're enjoyable, if fairly simple in their execution.     Throughout the course of each chapter, you spend a good amount of time developing your character's skill set and learning the particulars of each attack. Developing your grasp of combat mechanics is a fulfilling journey, but the prevalence of quick-time events repeatedly deflates the value of this progress. This is most obvious during boss fights, which demand precision and quick reflexes. The problem is that every boss battle concludes with a multipart quick-time event, and failing to hit the right timing simply resets the cinematic to the last successful input. Performing complex finishing moves with one or two well-timed button presses feels like a cop-out after mastering the tricky techniques and quick reflexes required during the heat of actual, not pseudo-cinematic, combat.       Mirror of Fate is best when it separates interactivity and passive entertainment, so the fact that it hurts itself by blurring the two so frequently is a major disappointment. Worse than that, there are numerous occurrences of a particular door in the later half of the game that can only be open by enduring repetitive, button-mashing quick-time events, and that's after you've acquired the skill that's supposed to enable you to open the door to begin with. Quite annoyingly, any treasure chests you find require the same rapid button presses to open.     With the return to 2D, there's a renewed attention to exploration and discovery. There aren't any fake walls or turkey roasts hidden away in bricks (barrels are a different story), but there are a fair amount of tempting opportunities lying in wait. Most hidden passages are easy to spot, and the handy map-notation tool makes returning to explore suspect locations a mostly simple affair. Unfortunately, the rewards fail to impress, and since there's very little variety to what you discover, the sense of wonder soon fades. You might discover a health or magic upgrade, or perhaps a new entry for your bestiary, but that's about it. It takes time to get used to the game's compartmentalized, as opposed to singular, map, but it's not too hard to navigate when the time comes to backtrack for secrets. The element of exploration is a nice nod to the past, but Mirror of Fate fails to match the joy of discovery found in previous Castlevanias.     All told, Mirror of Fate is a fun and occasionally challenging action game with successful elements and an unfortunate, but small, selection of poor design choices. By taking liberties with the series' lore, it opens the door for an exciting conclusion to the Lords of Shadow timeline. Had some of the inconsistencies in gameplay been ironed out, the experience would have felt much more cohesive, but as it stands, Mirror of Fate is a good, but not great, addition to the historic Castlevania series.  "
1052,SteamWorld Dig 2,9.0,2,"The first SteamWorld Dig was most notable for its unique blend of mining mechanics and Metroid-style exploration, but it ended right as it began to come into its own. Its sequel is twice as long and puts that added runtime to good use, as both the story and mechanics are given room to flourish. The result is a brilliant and varied evolution of the first game that not only expands upon its hybrid formula, but presents it in its best light.SteamWorld Dig 2 takes place in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world where Earth has become a desert wasteland; its remaining inhabitants are small populations of steam-driven robots and irradiated humans. You control a steambot named Dorothy searching for her missing friend, Rusty--the protagonist of the first game. When Dorothy hears that he has been sighted entering the mines of an old trading town, El Machino, she embarks on a journey to find him.The story is more focused than its predecessor. Events unfold at a brisk pace, occasionally hitting you with unexpected twists and tonal shifts that keep the adventure compelling throughout. Also impactful is the way the story contributes to the overarching SteamWorld universe as a whole (it serves as a bridge between Dig 1 and SteamWorld Heist). By its conclusion, past narrative threads that were once disparate and unclear are finally expounded upon, elevating your attachment to the characters and the world.Even if you aren't invested in the series' lore, Dig 2 gives you more than enough to latch onto with its eclectic cast. Dorothy makes for a likable lead and the characters who surround her are humorous and well-written. In particular, Dorothy's Navi-like sidekick, FEN, is one of the game's standout personalities. His sassy, oftentimes snarky, remarks are amusing, but as you progress, he grows into a far more sincere and endearing ally whose presence is irreplaceable.Also worth noting is the presentation; both visuals and music are charming and stylish. From the moodily lit underground caverns you explore to the airy and upbeat hip-hop inspired tracks that permeate the various locales, there's an endearing atmosphere that constantly pulls you in.Like the first game, you spend time exploring various underground mines. With your trusty pickaxe, you smash through blocks of dirt to reveal passageways, while along the way acquiring precious gems and minerals. You also obtain tools and power-ups that help you burrow even deeper. Once your pockets are filled with treasure, you return to town to sell your materials and upgrade your tools, and then you return to the mine anew.While the digging process seems repetitive in nature, it never becomes tedious. Exploration feels like longform puzzle solving. You're always strategizing how to take advantage of a mine's terrain and the enemies within to clear tunnels and acquire more treasure. And with the more varied tools you have access to this time around, the methods you employ grow increasingly complex.One moment you're using your pressure bomb launcher to create a pathway that you can't reach with your pickaxe, the next you're using your grappling hook to strategically detonate a TNT barrel to kill a group of enemies. These instances are when the game is at its most fulfilling, as you have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how to approach a given area. Dig 2 encourages you to be methodical, but unlike the original, it gives you more time to be creative, and rewards your cravings to diligently explore and discover new secrets.New to Dig 2 is the addition of collectables called Cogs, which you can use to enhance your tools with mods. These upgrades are varied and unique, each improving your abilities in different ways. For instance, you can equip a mod that increases your chances of getting two precious materials from one resource block, or you might equip one that occasionally prevents instant death from falling rocks. As you obtain more Cogs, your ability to tailor mods to better suit your playstyle grows, which becomes invaluable when facing difficult obstacles in later areas. And with the varied terrain and hazards you encounter, you always feel an initiative to experiment to better your mining efficiency and chances of survival.When you're not spending time digging, you're exploring caves, which are special rooms scattered across the map containing either platforming challenges or puzzles to solve. These brief, well-crafted trials test your mastery of the game's base mechanics: a spike-covered room demands quick execution of your mobility options; a block-stacking puzzle challenges your knowledge of the pressure launcher's limitations; and a room with collapsing boulders has you timing your sprints in different spurts to avoid being crushed. On top of rewarding you with much-needed Cogs, caves provide satisfying opportunities to exercise your reflexes and intellect. You often look forward to discovering them, as their distinct challenges are also entertaining proving grounds to test your upgrades.Alongside the mechanical improvements, it helps that there's a greater variety in level and objective design. From an ancient temple surrounded by lava to an ethereal jungle, each location you explore goes beyond the standard underground mine you might expect. Not only are levels thematically different, they're also structured in distinct ways from each other. At one point, you're tasked to dig horizontally instead of vertically, only to be led to an area that has you completing a gauntlet of caves in order to open a gate with multiple locks. These changes in design frame the mechanics in captivating ways, challenging you to do more than just strategically carve out tunnels. Dig 2 meticulously uses its assets to great effect, continually changing up the pace from beginning to end.Every advancement Dig 2 makes to its story and mechanics strengthens your initiative to progress. There's an overwhelming sense of momentum that runs through the adventure; as if developer Image &amp; Form sifted the original in a pan, removing its redundancies while expanding upon what made it so fun to persistently play. In your quest to acquire every upgrade and explore every nook and cranny, there's no shortage of hidden collectables to discover. And with post-game content that unlocks after you unearth every secret, the desire to keep digging intensifies. Dig 2 manages to not only be an exceptional successor, but a great adventure in its own right. Where the first game was a diamond in the rough, Dig 2 is a polished jewel."
2030,SimCity 4,8.0,2,"Long before game designer Will Wright created the best-selling computer game of all time, The Sims, he created SimCity, an innovative game with a clear, compelling premise: You're the mayor, and your goal is to plan a city from the ground up (and from a godlike vantage point) and then nurture it, eventually turning what starts as a sleepy little town into a bustling metropolis. SimCity was challenging and plausibly realistic and even had a surprising amount of humor, especially for a game with a seemingly mundane subject. About 15 years have passed since the original SimCity was first released, and while the classic SimCity series is still well known among PC gamers, it has only reached its fourth full installment. And SimCity 4 for the most part isn't a huge departure from its predecessors, either, not that it really needs to be. The game does have a number of new features and a few additional layers of depth on top of the preceding SimCity 3000, and its visuals have been impressively overhauled. However, due to the presence of some stability and performance issues, as well as a few noticeably lacking features, SimCity 4 doesn't seem as polished as it could have been. On the other hand, it's still a complex and detailed strategy game that can entertain you for hours on end and even teach you a thing or two.       As in SimCity 3000, the three zone types each have several different density options, so light-density residential zones are likely to sprout small houses or low-income apartments, while high-density residential zones could turn into tall, fancy condominiums. Denser zones are costlier to put in place but pack in more people, which means more tax dollars. But in SimCity 4, it pays to start slow. The early going can be very challenging at first (and there are no difficulty options available to ameliorate this), as you'll naturally wish to immediately add all the amenities you'd want in a city: running water, schools, hospitals, police stations, or a football field. At any rate, a fledgling town needs only the basics, and a continuously updating news ticker that's part of the interface will keep you informed about whether your sim population needs anything you're not already providing. You'll eventually get a feel for how to get people coming into your town without driving your budget too far into the red. The goal, of course, is to make your newly established city profitable as soon as possible, since that's when you can start expanding in earnest and finally afford that hospital or police station you've always wanted next to your football field.     Having to contend with the constantly shifting demand for the three zone types while continuously adding better services and transportation options for your population and while also keeping an eagle eye on your monthly budget adds up to some involving gameplay. SimCity 4, like its predecessors, succeeds at being an active, hands-on game where there's usually something interesting you can be doing. Even if you're waiting to rake in a certain amount of funds, you can use that time as an opportunity to scrutinize the many different statistics and charts available to you or to correspond with your various advisors on how to proceed. Or you can use the handy query tool to click around your city, gleaning all kinds of information, including a few amusingly pointless statistics. You can even just sit back and observe your city at the closest zoom level. See those crime-scene-style chalk outlines near your football field? Those mean you probably should spring for a new police station thereabouts. All this is not to say SimCity 4 is a fast-paced game, because you can play it at the rate you want. It's possible to pause the action outright and build as much as necessary before starting the clock back up, and you can freely switch between three different game-speed settings.  SimCity 4 has a sleek, attractive interface that's highly reminiscent of the one found in The Sims. Though all the different buttons are unlabeled and not necessarily intuitive, detailed pop-up tooltips appear when you float your mouse cursor over any of the options, and it won't be long before you figure out where everything is. Just as the interface effectively lays out all the information and building options you need to be the best mayor, the game itself now grants you a much finer level of control over some aspects of your city. As in previous SimCity games, you can raise and lower the tax rate to bring in more money or increase demand. However, taxes now are broken down first by the three zone types and then by economic class, meaning you can opt to heavily tax your arrogant high-tech industries while giving your humble farmers a break, and so on. Additionally, as in previous SimCity games, you can adjust the budgets for your police and fire departments and such, but now you're able to do this locally as well as globally. Does that inner-city precinct have a lot more on its hands than that suburban one? Then you can probably afford to cut the latter's budget, but maybe not the former's. To some extent, the game now forces you to micromanage your city in such a fashion, though it isn't strictly necessary.    Neither is the new MySim mode, which lets you import your characters from The Sims into the bigger world of this game. It's true that you can gain a lot of useful information about your city by transplanting one or more sims into homes of your choosing, as they'll frequently provide constructive criticism through the news ticker, but why follow one little person around when you've got 50,000 of them that need taking care of? As such, the MySim mode seems like an afterthought. The game also promises cooperative multiplayer support, but this isn't actually ready yet. Experienced SimCity players might also go in expecting to have numerous prebuilt cities available from the get-go, as well as stand-alone scenario options, but none of this is present in the game. The game does include regions modeled after real-world locations like San Francisco, New York, and Berlin, yet these are almost entirely barren landscapes--you'll need to build the actual cities yourself. Previous SimCity games also included challenging scenarios, such as having to deal with the aftermath of San Francisco's devastating 1906 earthquake. However, SimCity 4 offers only the standard free-form game mode. You'll of course be able to download plenty of player-created cities, but it's somewhat disappointing that the game itself seems rather bare-bones.    "
1880,Madden NFL 15,7.0,2,"Madden 25 didn't feel like the franchise's true next-generation debut. Inconsistent production values, holes in the passing game, and mechanical stagnation made what many had hoped to be a fresh start seem stuck in the mud. Thankfully, Madden 15 corrects the course by taking two big steps in the right direction. Firstly, revamped defensive play gives you a reason to actively participate as you defend a drive; secondly, precise attention to detail creates a more cohesive aesthetic package. Deficiencies in the passing game along with technical hiccups stemming from the game's often-comical physics still exist, but Madden 15's few missteps do little to detract from an otherwise strong outing. Controlling the defense has felt like an afterthought in recent years, since your actions as an active defender rarely made an impact on the progression of the play. But Madden 15 focuses on making it fun to play both sides of the ball. The most immediate change you’ll notice is a camera angle positioned behind whichever defender you control. If you’re on the line, you’re asked to time your attack to the center’s snap and fight your way through traffic to take out the quarterback. Favorable matchups allow you to slink past the offense through timely button presses, and once you’ve broken through, you’re given a handy visual indicator to illustrate your tackling range. The safest route is to use the more reserved tackle that almost guarantees an easy sack, but you can also make use of the less accurate hit stick if you’re feeling lucky. This has a greater chance of popping the ball free or even causing a game-changing injury. If you’re looking to force interceptions, controlling a member of the secondary remains advantageous since you’re more likely to pick off a pass when you’re in the driver’s seat, rather than when trusting the AI. The behind-the-back view that works so well for a pass rusher is disorienting when you swing over to a safety or cornerback, but on-the-fly adjustments allow you to switch to the classic camera angle that’s more advantageous in these circumstances. Still, you’re more equipped to defend passes than ever before as long as long as you stay tight on a receiver, and barreling through a strong offensive line to drag a top quarterback to the ground is supremely satisfying. Systems that previously felt automated now require your undivided attention, giving you more reasons to stay engaged in all four quarters of a game. When it comes to offensive play, the changes are more often seen than felt. The interface for picking plays has been revamped, cleaning up much of the previous clutter and giving you helpful information about suggested calls. Less-seasoned players who prefer to just settle for suggested plays often had little idea why short passes were more effective when the defense was about to blitz, or how one run play was likely to produce more positive yards over another. The logic behind the choices was hidden, but Madden 15 provides an explanation for the more casual football strategist. Coach’s suggestions are coupled with text that might mention how the opposing team is often vulnerable to a particular play during a specific down, while additional plays often used by the community show success rate and average yards gained. Experienced players will likely choose their own formation and offensive maneuvers, but taking the game’s advice is both viable and edifying. Favorable matchups allow you to slink past the offense through timely button presses, and once you’ve broken through, you’re given a handy visual indicator to illustrate your tackling range. The running game made considerable strides last year thanks to the improved interaction between the offensive and defensive lines, and it only feels sharper this time around. Breaking tackles, finding holes, and trucking past defenders looks and feels great, and the different attributes of each player--whether it be their acceleration or physical strength--are felt as soon as the ball is snapped. Pass plays, on the other hand, can lead to some frustrations. You have a great deal of finesse with the ball when taking control of a QB, as you’re able to throw bullet passes, lobs, and lead receivers if the coverage is tight. Receivers even make more creative catches than ever before, as it’s not uncommon to see daring one-handed grabs or long dives for passes just out of reach. But interceptions happen too often, and even the strongest receivers just don’t do enough to battle for the ball. Good defenders frequently prevent great receivers from making plays in single-coverage situations, so battling an adept secondary like Seattle's can feel like a lost cause. The vanilla Play Now and online Head-to-Head modes are there for the exploring, and they’re the best way to go if you just some want to throw on some pads and take to the field. But Connected Franchise is quickly becoming a feature attraction, and it’s been given a bit of a facelift this year. Here, you choose between becoming a player, owner, or coach of your favorite franchise, which gives you the power to either affect the flow of individual games or get deeply involved in the team’s upkeep. The newest additions are a “Game Prep” feature and a statistic for individual player confidence. Game Prep provides different activities during a given week that give you more experience to sharpen your skills, while confidence takes into account the ups and downs even veterans feel from week to week. Both add variety to the routine, providing more to do as a created player before the next big game rolls around. However, some of the Game Prep drills involve nothing more than selecting a player and immediately earning the additional points without even running a play. The interactive options aren’t much better, giving you simple objectives that vary depending on the position you play. A QB might need to complete four passes against a cover 1 defense, while a receiver could be asked to catch a ball in traffic. The confidence is a nice real-world touch, but it doesn't feel particularly impactful during your Super Bowl campaigns. Madden Ultimate Team is where I spent most of my time, but its structure is difficult to swallow. You create your fantasy team by opening booster packs bought with either in-game money or real cash. Solo challenges earn you coins and unlock full games with the possibility of greater monetary rewards, and the streamlined interface makes it easier than ever to slot in your best players to build a better team. However, the pacing of progression is too slow if you’re unwilling to whip out your wallet. Challenges just don’t earn a sufficient number of coins, so you’re left playing game after game with a team barely fit to take the field. Just throwing down a couple of bucks to expedite the process is tempting, turning what could be Madden's best mode into a microtransaction scheme. Interceptions happen too often, and even the strongest receivers just don’t do enough to battle for the ball. Even if you never go beyond the Play Now mode, the mechanical improvements on offense and defense make Madden 15 worth a look--as do the impressive visuals. Muscles bulge and beads of sweat spray across the turf as you drive against the opposition, and unlike in previous games, the athletes are highly distinctive. Individual player quirks, like Johnny Manziel's slippery, sporadic rushing style, are much more pronounced, and the crowds are not nearly as static as in previous years. It’s a technically stunning game, and the increased attention to detail--such as Packers fans bellowing John Kuhn’s last name as he makes big plays--goes a long way toward making this a real NFL experience. Players still awkwardly fall over each other as plays conclude and receivers are too often outmatched by similarly skilled corners, but even so, Madden 15 is the spark that this series needed. Controlling players on defense finally feels both fun and functional, and more informative playcalling gives newer players context for the technical side of the game. The feature set remains fundamentally unchanged, but each of the core modes have increased in breadth and decreased in clutter, making it easy to dig into features that might have seemed too dense from a distance. Madden 15 looks sharper than ever, but its biggest achievement is its dedication to improving core systems that have held the series back in the past."
3785,Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal,5.0,1," Let's get one thing straight, right off the bat, OK? Monster truckin' is totally awesome. Let's break it down into its component parts. Loud motors are cool. Breaking stuff is cool. We can all agree on these two things. When you combine the two into a gigantic, beastlike truck that drives over other cars and smashes them into dust, it's totally insane. A full-on sport has been constructed around the concept of big trucks that race each other and break stuff, and a handful of video games have come out over the years that have attempted to duplicate the county fair-style excitement in digital form. Most of them really aren't very good. In fact, most of them are pretty weak. Ubisoft's latest stab at the genre, Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal, is no exception.      Masters of Metal is broken up into a few different event types. The most standard event is a one-on-one race on a short, stadium track. This mode plays sort of like a 3D version of Excitebike. Your job is to mash the gas, ride the turbo button without overheating your truck, and level out your wheels over jumps to land with all four tires at the same time, thus keeping your speed up. The tracks are painfully short and bland, making this mode pretty dim. Off-road checkpoint-style races are up next. Here, you race against five different trucks in a 15-point race that has you driving all over a large area, often rife with obstacles and other stuff that you can break. This mode also lets you use truck power-ups, like extra turbo boosts, traction enhancers, or shields. It's a bit more exciting than the dopey circuit races, but it still lacks any real pizzazz. You can also enter into stunt exhibitions. Here you'll perform donuts, jump though flaming hoops, and so on. The stunts are a neat idea, but they're poorly executed. A career mode of sorts ties the different race types together as you go from track to track in search of trophies. The career mode also contains some laughably lame cutscenes. The game contains two-player multiplayer, which works just fine, though it doesn't really add much excitement to the mix, either.   Masters of Metal is a low-rent production from start to finish. The trucks themselves look OK, but the environments are really plain. Also, for a game that attempts to duplicate the thrill of smashing up puny cars with a giant-sized truck, you would think that the cars would actually break up or crush when you drive over them. But instead, the roofs of the few cars found on the stadium tracks are reinforced with steel or something, because they don't budge at all. Monster 4x4 contains a handful of real-life trucks, including the ever-popular Grave Digger, but the differences between the trucks, as well as between the game's different drivers, aren't clear. The trucks feel like they drive and handle identically regardless of your selection.   Since so much of monster trucking is about driving through stuff and over stuff, there's really a potential for great physics and damage models in a monster truck game. Masters of Metal has neither. The physics model in the game is acceptable. It's greatly exaggerated, so your truck is incredibly bouncy, and turbo-boosting off a jump practically sends you flying halfway across a level. The damage in the game consists of a few parts of your truck's body flying off, and if you take too much punishment, you'll lose a wheel and have to wait for a few seconds before it rematerializes. Destructible environments consist of fences, hot dog stands, and garage doors to bust through in the off-road races. It would have been nice to see more things like this throughout the game, as the importance of crushing cars can't be overstated. That's one of the basic concepts behind monster trucks, so for the game to go as far as to present cars for you to drive over but then fail to include the math required to crush those car polygons up seems like a pretty glaring oversight.      Generic guitar rock makes up Monster 4x4's soundtrack. The game's sound effects aren't very good, either, but the speech is where the game really sticks out. Each race is preceded by some announcer chatter, and the words are stitched together with all the nuance and quality of a 16-bit sports game. The inflection changes from word to word, and the speech is generally the sort of mess that you don't expect to hear in modern games.   Overall, Monster 4x4 fails to excite on any level. It offers a decent amount of different tracks and courses, but nothing that you do on any of these courses is the least bit interesting. While the GameCube isn't exactly long on off-road racing games, you can certainly find something better than Masters of Metal.  "
4156,Brothers in Arms: Double Time,4.0,0,"  Despite arriving on shelves the same day, Brothers in Arms: Double Time has nothing to do with the new Brothers in Arms game released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. It might have a new name, but the games inside the box--Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 and Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood--are more than three years old. Though they're dated, being able to pick up two excellent last-generation shooters for the price of one should be great, which is why it's a shame that these ports are terrible.         For those unfamiliar with the series, Brothers in Arms is about two things: historically accurate, emotionally compelling storytelling, and tactical gunplay. The stories in both games are similar in that they follow two men and their squads as they learn the cost of war. In the grand scheme of World War II games, the stories aren't unique. What sets them apart is their realistic and mature take on the brutality of war. Like in the Band of Brothers series of movies, well-acted voice-overs and poignant music give way to hellish depictions of battlefields. Overall, it's a serious and gritty presentation of war, or at least it was in 2005 when it was originally released. Now, a number of frustrating technical problems overshadow the somber plot.     Brothers in Arms takes a tactical approach to gunplay, forcing you to think and strategize before taking on a group of enemies. Using the Wii Remote as your cursor, you can order your squads to move around the map, suppress enemies, or charge with an assault. Though it had its missteps, the AI in the original games usually did what you wanted it to do, making you feel as if you were really commanding intelligent troops. In this port, your squadmates are as reliable as a rusty pistol. If they can manage to navigate the environment and join you in battle, you'll be lucky if they survive, considering that they have a knack for standing in the line of enemy fire. Your incapable allies will be a constant point of frustration against the tenacious enemies, who have a tendency to pop up out of nowhere and flank you at every opportunity.     The controls do little to ease the frustration of being stuck with idiots for teammates. The setup works adequately for shooting, with the remote handling aiming and looking, and the Nunchuk handling movement, but in hectic battles with flanking enemies, they aren't responsive enough. You can turn up the sensitivity and turn speed, but it never quite clicks together like a shooter should. You spend a lot of time thinking about and fussing with the controls, and it really pulls you out of the experience. A few motion-controlled gestures have been added, but most of them--such as grenade throwing and melee attacks--are hard to control and can leave you disoriented.      Visually, Brothers in Arms was at the top of its class in 2005, but you wouldn't know it from this port. Nearly every texture has a blurred, muddy look. If it weren't for the big red circles that appear over their heads, you wouldn't be able to tell a Nazi from a bush. The frame rate isn't good, and the game will frequently freeze for two or three seconds to catch its breath, giving you ample time to soak in the blurry countryside. The plodding frame rate and sluggish controls destroy the pace, making you feel like you're playing in slow motion.        The sound fares a bit better, though some of the gunfire is a little underwhelming. The voice acting is appropriately grim and laced with expletives. The music isn't showcased often, given that the game prefers to let the jarring sounds of battle take the forefront, but what is there is orchestral and heroic.     If you're looking for a WWII shooter for your Wii, don't be fooled by this ""deal."" Stripped of their multiplayer modes and loaded with technical issues, these two games aren't even worth the asking price of one.   "
3757,Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth Remix,5.0,1,"  Some titles beg to be remade or rereleased; Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, the PlayStation strategy role-playing game, is not one of them. It's not that Hoshigami Remix is bad, but it's wildly inconsistent and harshly demanding even on normal difficulty. It's also not a very good choice for a gamer on the go: Battles are long and the learning curve is steep, so short sessions are not only unsatisfying, they are often impossible. There are some good ideas at work here, but the game asks a lot of you and doesn't give a lot back, which makes playing it feel more like work than fun.      The main character of Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth Remix is Fazz, a mercenary who receives a surprise request for help from the king of Nightweld. The kingdom is under attack by the Valaimians, and he needs a hand from Fazz and his soldiers for hire. As it turns out, there is more to the invasion than meets the eye, and it's up to you to keep the powers of the ancients from falling into the wrong hands. It's nothing new to the world of RPGs, though Fazz turns out to be a bright and resourceful hero, and he'll stay interesting long after you stop caring about the plot. There are also some branching story paths that will determine which characters can join your party, as well as a number of alternate endings. It isn't the greatest tale, but there's something to be said for keeping things non-linear.        The basic plot outline may not be too complex, but Hoshigami's core gameplay is quite intricate. At first, it will seem simple enough to anyone that's played a turn-based strategy game before. At the onset of battle, you place your mercenaries on the battle grid, and each one takes turns moving to available squares, attacking an enemy, or performing other available actions. From here, the game breaks free from prevailing standards, most noticeably in how turns function. Each character has an RAP gauge, which stands for “read for action points.” Each action you perform drains the gauge, and the turn is over once the mercenary has fully depleted it. In theory, this means you can move, attack, and use an item all in the same turn, though there are benefits to not consuming the entire gauge: The more energy left in it when you end the turn, the sooner the character's next turn will come. The RAP meter is an excellent addition to the standard gameplay, and fully grasping its benefits is a big key to success in battle.      Were it combined with more intuitive gameplay elements, read for action points could have added some nice spice to orthodox conventions. But you'll find other aspects that have been convoluted to the point of unfriendliness. Spells aren't just spells, they are coins called coinfeigms. Each coin is infused with a particular type of magic, such as fire, earth, ice, or lightning, and each type has a number of different spells that can be earned and cast. Mana has an equivalent in the form of coinfeigm points, but the points are applied to the coin, not to the character. As a result, a character's ability to cast the spell depends on how much energy is left in his RAP meter, as well as how many points remain on that particular coin. Coins can also be upgraded by engraving seals on them, and just as there are many different coins available, so too are there a bunch of seals to apply. Seals and coins fit together in dense ways, so where one seal may increase a coin's effectiveness, another may render it almost useless. You can also engrave seals in pairs, which may enhance the coin further than if you applied each separately. How do you know what the effect is going to be? You don't. You will either need a photographic memory, a spreadsheet, or an FAQ to know how seals will affect coins, and to what extent. It isn't as though the game itself clues you in to this or anything else, so you'll be left to your own devices.     Confused yet? Well, there's more. Each character is aligned with one of six deities, which impacts how effective their attacks will be on other characters. If your mercenary follows Amu, he'll be strong against followers of Zeneth but weak against Gote. Furthermore, you'll earn devotion points as well as experience points during battle. Once a character advances a deity level, he can learn skills and gain (and lose) proficiency with certain weapons. You can also switch deities, enabling you to gain abilities from multiple gods.      One of the complexities, however, is a satisfying one: attack sessions. An attack session is a combo attack, and while pulling one off takes a good deal of patience, completing sessions is one of the few rewarding mechanics in Hoshigami. In standard combat, you time a button press with a battle meter to determine how much damage you'll do. In an attack session, you set up your characters in advance and perform a shoot attack, which knocks enemies backwards. If you time everything carefully, you can bounce an enemy from mercenary to mercenary like a pinball, doing a ton of damage and potentially earning an item for your troubles. It's hard to do, but when you do it, it gives you a real sense of accomplishment in a game that's high on work and low on returns.      Complex and detailed game mechanics aren't bad things, nor is it necessarily a problem to aim at a decidedly hardcore audience. But even if you are an experienced strategist and quick to pick up on all of these elaborate contrivances, you're still not likely to enjoy the experience. Keeping track of coinfeigms, deity relationships, and your RAP meter is a lot of work, but you will never feel all that rewarded. You need to periodically stop and level up in towers specifically created for level grinding, because as difficult as Hoshigami is, leveling up your characters and coins is more important than smart battlefield tactics. You will also discover halfway through the game's sixty or so hours that it is incredibly imbalanced. If you make the mistake of putting more effort into standard weaponry, you are in for a rude awakening and likely to throw the game away in disgust: Coins are essentially the only way to finish the game, and about twenty-five hours in, your melee fighters will be useless. Magic is highly overpowered, which means if you concentrated solely on improving coinfeigms, you should be able to eke by without too many issues. If you went with a more balanced party, or worse yet, built it around physical weaponry, you will be easily overpowered and potentially incapable of finishing unless you have a will of steel.         If you played Hoshigami on your PlayStation and for some reason feel obligated to check for differences, you will find a new playable character, a new (and thankfully improved) soundtrack, and other minor changes. As you can imagine, there is also touch-screen support, yet you'll be unlikely to use it, since variations in map terrain sometimes make it tough to choose the square you want. The game doesn't make very good use of the top screen during battle either, relegating it to showing unit statistics and not much else. The chance to add some flash to the plain isometric visuals was there for the taking, but the unique capabilities of the DS were left mostly untapped, which is just another reminder that some titles are better off left as distant memories. Not that it looks or sounds terrible. The character sprites are fine, and you may notice small details, like the way archers scan the horizon while you queue up their attack. But coin effects are simple and unexciting, so battle has very little pizzazz, and the game is missing personality as a result. Some sound effects are OK, while others are just weird, like the banshee wails that female units emit upon defeat.     Needless to say, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth Remix is not a handheld-friendly game, let alone user-friendly. To play it, you need to find a quiet corner, grab your notes, and settle in. Complexity can be a good thing of course, but here, the resulting gameplay is just frustrating without anything to compensate for it. If you're into strategy RPGs, the ideas may interest you, but even the most devout players will decry the unbalanced combat and emphasis on level-grinding over strategy. As a result, this is a game that's not really for anyone.     "
3914,Atlantis Evolution,5.0,1," There are times when playing Atlantis Evolution could make Chinese water torture look like an appealing alternative. The writing and voice acting are so bad they're almost good--you probably won't find more unintentional camp humor in a game. The interface can be cumbersome. The gameplay will have you shaking your head in disbelief and disgust as you encounter one badly designed puzzle, maze, or action sequence after another. Fortunately, if you can bear playing Atlantis Evolution long enough, it starts to get better toward the end, but by then it's scant consolation.       In Atlantis Evolution, you play as Curtis Hewitt, a young photojournalist steaming home to America in 1904 after an expedition to Patagonia. His ship sinks during a fierce storm, leaving him stranded on a lifeboat that spirals down through a whirlpool into a hidden world. Then an alien craft appears overhead and sucks Hewitt up into it. From there, he's transported to the civilization of New Atlantis, which he has to explore and escape from.    That's no easy task, because Hewitt is viewed as a ""deviant,"" an outsider who doesn't bow to the ruthless, all-seeing ""gods"" who rule the Atlanteans with iron fists. Everywhere Hewitt goes, he encounters statues of the angry humanoid gods, statues that are actually observation devices used to intimidate the simple agrarian populace into utter obedience. Hewitt also gets chased by armed guards who zap him at the slightest provocation. When he tries to glean helpful information from cowed, zombielike workers, they only regurgitate whatever they've been taught to say.   The idea of a simple civilization forced to submit to suspicious alien gods will be nothing new to science-fiction fans. It still could have proven interesting if it weren't so horribly implemented in Atlantis Evolution. Between the stilted dialogue, weak voice-overs, lapses in logic, and exaggeration that slams every point home with the subtlety of a Day-Glo jackhammer, the story begins to feel like a big joke.    You start to see this early on, when you encounter an enemy guard who has a litany of ridiculous things to say to you. Imagine a Keanu Reeves impersonator. Now imagine him reading a line like, ""The path you will follow to humility depends on the death of your deviancy."" Whoa! When you try to escape from the guard, he shoots you with some kind of ray gun and warns you, ""And that was nothing, outsider. This weapon can reduce you to dust."" A few dialogue clunkers like that wouldn't be so bad, but they're everywhere, lending the game an unintentional air of parody. Simple peasant farmers casually note, without any hint of irony, how they've been ""purified and freed from independent thought."" They'll assure you that ""[truly they] are blessed to be so downtrodden for [their] own good."" This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material.      You play the game from a first-person view with occasional cutscenes that show Hewitt interacting with people. You proceed from one fixed node to another, though you can pan the camera 360 degrees. You interact with the world using a basic point-and-click interface, but for something ideally so simple, it's surprisingly flawed and counterintuitive. It takes too many mouse clicks to access, use, or store inventory items. It can be hard to move around, thanks to a bug that sometimes prevents your mouse click from registering. (Other bugs can cause the game to crash and sounds to drop out.) When talking to characters, you choose topics by clicking on little icons instead of text. This system works pretty well, but you may as well just click all the icons, since ""conversation"" in this game means sitting back and passively listening to characters.    The biggest deal breaker in Atlantis Evolution is its gameplay. When you're exploring a village early in the game, your first ""puzzle"" is the dramatic task of getting a drink of water. That can turn into an onerous chore. A cutscene can mislead you about the location of the bucket you need to dip into the village well. If you try to leave the village to find it, you're told you need more information first. That leads you to believe you need to talk with the villagers for clues, even though you've probably already done that. Eventually, after a pixel hunt, you find the bucket and grab your precious drink of water.    Now the ""fun"" is only beginning. You leave the village to find yourself pursued by enemy guards. You run away by clicking on the path in front of you, but you discover you're in a forest maze with no clue at all where to go. If you slow down and consider your path, the guards catch you, and you have to restart the segment from scratch. You might finally elude them by finding shelter in a cave, but there you find yourself confronted with a row of marching crab-spider thingies. If you get too close, they leap onto your face and kill you, and you have to start the segment over. Why you can't jump over or climb around them is unclear, but it does become clear that you need another inventory item to pass them. So, it's back out into the forest for another endless series of do-overs whenever the guards catch you while you seek the elusive item. Heck, you don't even know what you're looking for.       The sad irony is that after you solve this segment, you're plopped down in another forest maze and then another one after that. There you engage in more pixel hunts for items like a stick. A stick in a forest--of course! These sorts of annoying, boring, repetitive, or downright dumb challenges fill the game. If you're not wandering through confusingly similar scenery again and again, you're hunting for tiny objects when you don't even know what you're looking for. When it's not a pixel hunt, it's a string of nearly identical Dragon's Lair-style action sequences with sloppy controls and ""gotcha"" deaths. When it's not a cheap death, it's a simplistic minigame that has nothing to do with the main gameplay or story. These minigames lamely ape old classics like Defender or Frogger, so you actually have to win a match of Snake to shut down a big death ray and play a game of Pong to battle the gods.   Despite its lengthy catalog of flaws, Atlantis Evolution isn't all bad. In one segment, you get caught in a tree snare and suddenly find yourself viewing the world upside down as you helplessly dangle there in a net. It's an unexpected and memorable touch. In a dramatic cutscene, a giant water serpent attacks our hero. The puzzles start to get more interesting and original when you finally encounter the humanoid gods. The game also boasts some decent music, replete with unusual ethnic instrumentation. It helps make up for the many weak voice-overs that badly mar the audio. You'll encounter colorful graphics, too, with lavishly appointed private chambers for the gods and forests of huge alien flora. Then again, a lot of the graphics are blurry or numbingly repetitive. In fact, numbed is how you'll likely feel after subjecting yourself to the tedium and torments of Atlantis Evolution. If you can stick it out until the final third or so, you'll find a few rewards, but unfortunately they're too little, too late.  "
3699,Scrabble Blast Deluxe,5.0,1,"  Scrabble Blast Deluxe has very little to do with actual Scrabble, except that the tiles are modeled after those in the classic board game and that points in the game are allotted based on the value of the letters you use. But unlike in traditional Scrabble, instead of playing letters out of your hand onto a board, the objective in Scrabble Blast Deluxe is to create words out of adjacent tiles to make them disappear. As you use letters, additional ones fill in from above, until you've used the given 100 letters. This particular detail isn't true to Scrabble, and it's not unlikely that you'll come across repeats of letters (such as Q) that wouldn't be found in a normal Scrabble bag.     The gameplay is similar to a few other games like Bookworm and Bespelled, but Scrabble Blast Deluxe isn't quite as polished as its PopCap counterparts. The only thing notable about the game is that there's a definite ending. Once you've run out of letters, the game gets more interesting, because your goal is to try to scrounge together words from the few remaining letters on the board. The presentation of the game isn't top-notch, but it's fair enough. You'll probably be happier with the alternatives unless you have a particular predilection toward the Scrabble franchise.  "
3973,Crashday,5.0,1,"  If you were to smoosh together the FlatOut series of demolition racing games and Nadeo's TrackMania stunt-racing franchise, then systematically vacuum out all of the most appealing aspects of both titles, you'd have the basic equivalent of Crashday. It's not that the game is terrible, but so little of it feels genuine or original; it's more of a cheap, hacked-together clone of the aforementioned titles. And what's more, it isn't even a particularly good clone. The game's race modes lack coherency--let alone excitement--and the stunt and combat modes fall flat.         There's supposed to be a premise to Crashday, but it's anyone's guess as to what it is exactly. Booting up the game's career mode simply drops you right into the middle of a backstory that features up-and-coming racers in some cockamamie imaginary racing league. But the text doesn't explain much, and the guy doing the voice acting is practically indecipherable. Imagine, if you will, a game developer tracking down the man with the thickest British accent in the world, plopping him down in front of a series of bad New York mafia movies, handing him a script, and demanding he talk exactly like the gangsters portrayed onscreen. That's how awful the voice acting is in Crashday.      Once you realize the premise is best ignored and actually jump into the game, you'll find gameplay that's just as clumsy as the voice acting. Racing in Crashday is exceedingly frustrating. Cars are a floaty, slippery mess, sliding out and crashing into random objects on a regular basis. This is an arcade racer, so no one's asking for a devout dedication to realism. But arcade or not, these cars are not fun to drive, nor do they handle well. Of course, the trick is that you have to drive especially fast because the other racers have a preternatural ability to use their speed boosts at all the right moments and will always blaze past you if you screw up. So what you end up having to do is memorize every nook and cranny of each race track just so you can figure out where to use your boost and where not to use it. Another weird thing is that the game's sense of speed isn't all that good. You definitely get the sense that your car is about to go flying out of control at any second, but the visceral thrill of high-speed racing is basically absent.     Only the stunt and combat races are slightly better than the sense of speed. Stunt modes include tracks filled with ramps, jumps, and loops, but there's a highly limited scope to the stunt track designs. The game lacks the sort of ""look at how completely insane these tracks are"" vibe that such games as TrackMania have all but perfected. They're not kooky or bizarre; they're just a bunch of ramps and loops. And they're not even laid out well. The bonus is that the game does include a track editor, but even its scope is limited, allowing for a few bizarre twists but not much more.     The combat modes come in a couple of forms. There are straight-up demolition races where the goal is to just slam into opponent cars over and over again until everyone has exploded but you. Then there are weapon-based modes that give you a Gatling gun and a missile launcher so you can go nuts. These are, by far, the most entertaining modes in the game because, in stark contrast to the driving physics, the game's crash physics aren't half bad. Cars break apart pretty nicely, and the weapons aren't hard to aim or use, which makes wanton destruction a fairly painless process. The main issue here is the limited array of tracks and weapons. It would be nice if there were more variety to the destruction at hand. But sadly there isn't, and after a few plays against the computer, the action does get a bit tiresome.     Multiplayer would theoretically remedy that issue, but even the multiplayer isn't without problems. The primary problem is that there's nobody online to play against. Sure, the servers list lots of games being played, but they're all being played across the pond by players in Europe. And the European version of the game isn't compatible with the US version for some reason. So you won't be able to play against any of them until Moonbyte patches one version or the other. We spent a considerable amount of time trying to find a US-based opponent but only found one playable online match during that entire span. To make matters worse, lag practically wrecked the experience. Trying to play a crash race while cars skip and jump all over the track is just about the most obnoxious thing you'll ever experience.        Apart from the awful voice acting, the remainder of Crashday's production value is bit more laudable. As mentioned previously, the crash effects are done quite nicely, and the cars deform and explode about as well as you would hope. The car models aren't exactly impressive, but considering you're just thrashing them over and over again, they don't need to look pristine. The tracks are easily the weakest point of the visuals. The background environments are extremely generic, dressed up with bland-looking towns and set pieces, as well as unattractive textures. They're not hideous, but they're definitely not pleasing to the eye.     Of course, someone could try to justify the plain-Jane gameplay and total lack of originality found in Crashday by simply mentioning that it's only a $20 game. Do you want to know how much a new copy of FlatOut 2 costs on the PC? Yes, that's right, $20. And a copy of TrackMania: Sunrise? It's the same price. Do yourself a favor and go right to the sources of Crashday's inspiration rather than pay for a bargain-basement, bush-league version of the same basic gameplay concepts.  "
1769,Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy,7.0,2,"the game to own for Nintendo's little dual-screen wonder. It was the kind of game no one was making on a system that was meant to do what no one else was doing. That made it special. Fast forward to 2014, four sequels and two spin-offs later, and now we have the first three games--Ace Attorney, Justice For All, and Trials &amp; Tribulations--cleaned up, brushed off, given a simple 3D spitshine, and trotted out to the Nintendo eShop. The gameplay has remained untouched, for better and worse: You're still playing the well-coiffed crusader of justice called in to collect clues from crime scenes, scream objections when you've caught ne'er-do-wells in a lie, and ask all the right questions to make the most weird and wild collection of bad guys and gals since Adam West's Batman all lose their cool on the witness stand. The good news is that, at least conceptually, the original Phoenix Wright trilogy has held up very well over time. The problem is that it's not exactly special anymore. It's actually a great problem to have. Point-and-click adventures and visual novels like Phoenix Wright are in vogue, and games are pushing the envelope several times a year. Even with that being the case, courtroom drama isn't exactly a crowded subgenre, and, as such, the Phoenix Wright games are still a unique snowflake in that regard. Where the Phoenix Wright games still stand out among the lot of them is in sheer charm. The streamlined anime art style, and the games' jovial sense of humor permeate everything. Phoenix Wright's world is a world of over-exaggerated reactions to everything, of eye-rolling yet brilliant puns, of unsubtle but slick pop culture references (personal favorite: The clown-based Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reference in Justice For All), and of fully formed, distinct, and wildly imaginative casts of characters with story arcs stretching over multiple games. Even though we're still dealing with murders--an overwhelming number of murders, but we'll get to that--there's such a lightness and color to the game it's hard to resist spending time with them over and over again as opposed to, say, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter's dour menagerie. The series forgoes any sort of CSI-style deep diving to present the player with problems of logic, and using observation to point out glaring inconsistencies in the stories of liars, cheats, and murderers instead of just rote item collection, where the game is on rails as long as you have the right item in your possession. It's not a perfect system, especially the more complex the case is. There are dozens of instances where the judge asks for a clue to prove the witness is a liar, and the clue that makes sense in real life is not the one the game actually marks as correct, but for the most part, there's a common sense to advancing in all three games. In that regard, it's still old school in the best way: the player's intellect, not their talent for scrounging, is the core of the gameplay here. And yet, there was an opportunity with the Ace Attorney Trilogy. Every year that passes, every time the game gets ported to a new platform, the series' GBA roots become more and more obvious, and its limitations become glaring. Its simplified anime art-style, while functional, can be seen here as consistent, but often repetitive, with the series' recent efforts towards innovation all occurring in the games after Trials and Tribulations released. The cases are almost always murders, with only rare variations to investigate a clue, or get a witness' story straight, and, more often than not, the game shows you who did it before Phoenix is allowed to figure it out. Interrogation methods haven't improved in all three games, though Justice For All's Psyche Lock system, a way of picking at a witness' testimony to get to their deepest secrets, is nice, though an even more cartoony addition than needed. But more than anything, the three games have been ported to multiple systems now, and the only real enhancements have been to the graphics. The 3DS trilogy is, to its credit, the sharpest it has ever looked or sounded. The extra real estate from the top screen has been put to good use, and the 3D is subtle, but the layering effect of all the character art is a nice, effective touch. Meanwhile, the 3DS has seen its own exclusive Phoenix Wright sequel that finally brings all the innovation the fancy new hardware can afford to the table. It would've been a painstaking process, no doubt, but the first Phoenix Wright's final mission brings such welcome changes to the table, using the DS's audio and touchscreen functions, that the other two games, which still haven't gotten a similar treatment, are dimmed by comparison. Instead, the only other real enhancement to this new version is the ability to play the games in their original Japanese forms, which is neat if you understand Japanese, though Jeremy Blaustein's English localization is wonderful enough as it is. There is, of course, the off-chance that the trilogy might be someone's first exposure to the life and times of Phoenix Wright, or at least their first exposure in a great many years, and it's as refined a jumping-off point for that as can be expected. For anyone for whom this is their third, four, or fifth time around, there's nothing new to discover, aside from the convenience of having all three games in one handy digital package. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but knowing what the 3DS and this series is capable of, the games' flaws have never been more glaring, and not nearly enough has been done to overrule the objections players have had for years."
2650,Lone Survivor,8.0,2,"     You play as the nameless title character, seemingly the only human left after a plague has turned most of the population into faceless, shambling zombies. Despite this devastating catastrophe, you encounter other ""people"" with whom you can interact: a white-faced man, a man with a cardboard box on his head, and a few others, but how real these people are (and whether or not they're outright malevolent) is a matter of perspective. See, the main character is in a constant struggle against not only the mutants outside his apartment, not only his own hunger and fatigue, but sanity itself. Choices you make in the game--whether or not to carry on a conversation with a stuffed animal, for example--have real effects on how the main character keeps his marbles together; although to the game's great credit, it's not always clear what will be beneficial and what will be detrimental when you choose.     However you treat your character's mind, though, you face a series of challenges once he inevitably decides to sally forth from his lonely apartment into the world beyond. The halls of his apartment building are home to some of the aggressive mutants, but you are presented early on with a radio broadcast urging survivors to head to an apartment on the other side of the building. To be sure, you have to come back to your apartment over and over to sleep (which is also the only way to save your game) and because it serves as a base of operations for everything you do. Apart from trying to sort out the aftermath of the zombie plague, your character can focus on smaller, side-quest-type goals, like repairing a stove to cook more-palatable food (good for your sanity) or taking care of a houseplant--and all of these are centered on your apartment.       Fortunately, a series of mirrors placed throughout the gameworld let you teleport to and from your home base instantaneously (and also serve to give you a sense of your overall health and sanity). Unfortunately, the game's mapping system leaves a great deal to be desired. For one thing, the maps are rendered in an overhead, bird's-eye-view format, while the game itself is entirely side-scrolling. This leads to a lot of going the wrong way as you try to spatially reorient yourself. Merely annoying most of the time, this disorienting discrepancy between map layout and gameplay perspective is absolutely hair-tearing during a couple of chase sequences in which you have to figure out where you're going, orient yourself properly, and avoid being killed, all in real time. Opening the map does not pause the game, and you can easily become zombie food while you're trying to remember whether it's a right or a left you need to take.        Such chase sequences are few and far between, thankfully, and most of Lone Survivor's gameplay involves sneaking past zombies, solving item-based puzzles, and uncovering the storyline. The main character does acquire a pistol fairly early on, and you have to engage zombies in combat, but this is intentionally made difficult because of your character's awkwardness with the weapon (and the sparsity of ammunition), and should be done only when absolutely necessary. You get past most zombies either by sneaking around them via recesses in the walls or by dropping rotting meat as a lure to distract them--or simply by finding routes that circumvent where they are.       Mapping issues aside, Lone Survivor presents you with a world that's constantly engaging. The atmosphere is unceasingly depressive and nervous, with periodic hallucinations interrupting the gameplay and the main character's own frequent complaints about hunger, fatigue, and loneliness adding to the sense of urgency. The visual style evokes the old 2D adventure games of decades past, with modern flourishes that add to the oppressive atmosphere. In fact, excellent use of lighting (you are given a flashlight at the outset of the game) and shadow, along with rust-colored filters and generally putrid color tonality, contributes heavily to the palpable sense of loneliness and terror that your character must be feeling.      Whether you're under the influence or not, however, the standout element of Lone Survivor is its sound. Frequent use of industrial effects, hideous mutant screams, heartbeats, and quiet static set a bereft tone, but even more powerful is the game's soundtrack. Music is used only in specific instances, but it's so effectively written (in a sort of jaunty-horrific tone) and paired so well with what goes on when it's used that it carries you off completely into the gameworld when it starts playing.       You can complete the game in about three or four hours. And while the various side quests and minigames (and the game's multiple endings) offer replayability, it's disappointing that a large chunk of actual game time ends up being spent trying to make sense of the map. Having said that, quality is what keeps games memorable and important, not the raw amount of time you spend playing them. And Lone Survivor helps you remember what quality games are really all about: an emotionally enrapturing experience that leaves you with plenty of questions to ponder and possibilities to imagine as you go about your day.   "
87,Tales of Symphonia,5.0,1,"Tales of Symphonia was a formative experience for me. For my young 11-year-old brain, it redefined my understanding of the JRPG genre. The vibrant presentation, action-focused combat, and mature story took me by surprise. Weekend after weekend, a friend and I would explore the world of Sylvarant together, making incremental progress in each play session. While I had played a few JRPGs before, none had hooked me the way Tales of Symphonia had.Despite my deep reverence for Tales of Symphonia, I haven't touched it since 2004. I don't really know why. I bought it on PC a few years back, but it just felt wrong to play that game sitting at my desk one random evening after work--almost as if it would tarnish the magic of that experience and the memories tied to it. However, with the release of Tales of Symphonia Remastered, I decided it was finally time to return to this world to see if it was as good as I remember. The result was a bit mixed.Tales of Symphonia follows a kid named Lloyd Irving as he accompanies the Chosen One on a globetrotting adventure. The Chosen One, Colette, instructed by divine prophecy, must ""regenerate"" the world in order to end war, famine, and hatred. It seems like standard JRPG fare, but the story is darker and far more complex than it initially lets on. Despite trying to do the right thing, Lloyd and his companions are confronted with moral quandaries that often leave a trail of destruction behind them. What makes the story so effective is how it rarely shies away from the consequences of our heroes' actions. Conflicts are rarely resolved neatly, and the story is better for it.What makes the story truly memorable, though, is the excellent cast of characters. To this day, Symphonia still has the best cast of characters the series has ever seen. Lloyd is a charismatic, hot-headed kid seeing the world for the first time. Genis is a clumsy spellcaster who serves as the perfect best friend and foil to Lloyd. While Kratos, upon first glance, appears to be a cold and detached mercenary, he quickly becomes a stoic father figure to Lloyd. There's a great dynamic between all of the party members that lead to some funny, heartwarming, and devastating moments over the course of the journey.The story and characters are occasionally held back by some awkward localization, but the lack of a proper quest-tracking system is what really halts the momentum. Like in the original, there is a Synopsis menu that summarizes your adventure so far and occasionally tells you where to go next. The problem is that these ""synopsis"" entries are a pain to sift through and can be vague at times, meaning you could be aimlessly wandering around the map until you stumble on a point of interest that triggers a cutscene. The inelegant, but often necessary, solution is to pull up a walkthrough. Tales of Symphonia also has a handful of side quests, some of which are missable. Once again, there isn't a reliable way to track these quests, so it's very easy to miss out on some.The presentation doesn't do Tales of Symphonia many favors, either. The user interface has received a few minor tweaks, but it looks nearly identical to the PS3 port released in 2013. The cutscenes are just as stiff and awkward as they were back in 2004, and the overworld is bland and lifeless. And the classic chibi-esque style feels at odds with some of the game's darker themes. It's hard to take some of the more emotional moments seriously when they are played out by cutesy characters.What sets the Tales Of series apart from other JRPGs is its real-time combat. While you can still pause time to change your tactics, manage unique attacks called Artes, and use items, the combat itself plays out in real time. Success in battle requires some light meter management and stringing together basic attacks with Artes. This basic combat loop hasn't changed much with subsequent titles in the series, but compared to Tales of Berseria and Tales of Arise, it feels stiff and painfully slow. Eventually, as you unlock more Artes, combos become intricate and, in turn, are more satisfying to pull off, but the early hours can feel like a slog.To offset the repetitive nature of combat, you can play as different party members. Each character boasts a different playstyle with unique Artes and bespoke combos. Spellcasters like Genis thrive on the edge of the battlefield slinging spells from afar, while the assassin Sheena, voiced by the incredible Jennifer Hale, uses elemental cards to attack her foes. No matter who you play, you can't escape the lackadaisical pace of combat, though.Although most combat encounters are relatively slow and straightforward, boss fights are a highlight. These demand a thoughtful party composition, clever tactics, and smart item management. Even on the normal difficulty level, players might find it difficult to coast through boss encounters like they would regular ones. While the fundamentals still feel a little clunky, the increased challenge makes boss fights considerably more engaging.On Nintendo Switch, I did run into a few technical issues in the first 10 hours. A couple of rooms within specific dungeons suffer from noticeably low frame rates. This doesn't carry over into combat, so it doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it's still jarring seeing a 19-year-old game suffer from frame rate issues on modern hardware--especially considering the original Nintendo GameCube release targeted 60 frames per second. Additionally, in the Town of Asgard, the game hitches up every time you enter a building. So far this is the only instance of this I've seen, but it's another bizarre issue that, although it doesn't directly affect gameplay, is weird to see nonetheless.More frustratingly, my game crashed twice in the first 10 hours. What made these crashes particularly painful is the lack of an auto-save feature paired with Tales of Symphonia's rigid save system. You can only save in certain locations, and some save spots are inaccessible without a specific item. That means that one poorly timed crash can erase hours of work. I've lost a total of two hours to crashes. Both crashes happened during extended play sessions of four or more hours. Since then, I've been saving regularly and relaunching the game every few hours, and I haven't had any crashes since. It's also worth noting that both crashes happened prior to a day-one patch, which is now available. Hopefully, this means players picking up the game on launch won't run into these same issues.Tales of Symphonia Remastered is still a captivating JRPG that's--unfortunately--a bit tough to recommend today given some of its dated exploration mechanics and rough presentation. A few modern conveniences could have gone a long way like auto-saving and quest tracking, but its emotional story regularly subverts expectations and explores the gray areas in what may seem like a straightforward adventure. All told, it's a thin remaster that doesn't shine a very flattering light on one of my favorite JRPGs."
3188,TrackMania: Build to Race,7.0,2,"  If you weren't familiar with the TrackMania series, you might expect a conventional racing game in TrackMania Wii. In fact, this is a generously sized set of time trials on increasingly tricky tracks, and boasts a comprehensive track creator, a stunt-heavy platforming mode, plus a nifty puzzle mode that combines building and driving. The point of TrackMania Wii (known as Trackmania: Build to Race in the US) is to navigate twisting stunt tracks at top speed, shaving fractions of seconds from your record; your ""racing"" rivals are only ever ghost cars. The most advanced of the 200-plus courses feature boost strips, loops, enormous jumps, and tilting stretches of elevated road; these are equal parts exhilaration and aggravation, with the balance occasionally tipped towards the latter. At TrackMania's lightning speeds, the difference between triumph and disaster is an infinitesimal steering nudge. Subpar music and so-so visuals diminish this substantial, challenging bundle, as do the occasional spikes of frustration; on the hardest tracks the times set by the bronze, silver, and gold medal ghost cars are excessively tough.        In single-player Race mode, there are dozens of tracks to unlock and master, ranging from practice difficulty to extreme. The tracks are divided across six environments (stadium, coast, island, desert, snow, and rally), with each offering a single car type--a racing car for the stadium, a pickup for snow driving, and so on. Tracks are unlocked by earning medals, one of the game's currencies. The other currency, coppers, is used to buy further tracks, as well as car skins and building blocks for the track creation mode. Race mode alone will keep even skilful drivers occupied for a long time, and you can expect countless restarts on the most challenging tracks (an instant restart button does go some way to mitigate frustration). These tracks offer the biggest thrills, too; if you've got the resolve to try and try again, the eventual flawless corner, a soaring jump, or sailing through the finish line just ahead of the gold medal ghost car is elating.      The six car models are skinnable but not tunable, and each has a distinct handling type--an unsubtle but appropriate caricature of what you might expect from the real thing. The racer sticks like glue to the stadium tracks, the pickup chugs up snowy slopes, and the finicky handling on the desert's bulky muscle vehicle compounds the difficulty on complex sandy tracks. Of the control options (tilt, directional pad, or nunchuk), the remote and nunchuk scheme works best, with the analog stick providing the smoothest steer. The single-player offering's Platform mode puts a nice twist on the time-trial race format: success on the dedicated, stunt-based tracks (with plentiful tricky jumps) is determined not by how fast they are completed but by how many times you need to restart at a checkpoint.         "
4151,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian The Video Game,4.0,0,"  Like actor Ben Stiller, whose likeness features prominently in the game, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian is completely harmless and rather short. These aren't unexpected qualities in a kid-friendly film tie-in, but when a game is barely longer than the movie it apes, it's hard to justify a purchase, even at a budget price. This blandly innocuous game does offer up a few clever gameplay mechanics that provide doses of amusement, but these bright spots can't completely veil the awkward platforming and forced, occasionally uncomfortable humor.         Had Stiller infused his performance with a bit more energy, perhaps Battle of the Smithsonian would have been funnier, but sleepy delivery and awkward timing make the lame dialogue fall even flatter. As his character Larry Dailey, the protagonist of both Night at the Museum films, you leave the confines of the American Museum of Natural History for the expanses of the Smithsonian. There, Pharaoh Akhmenrah's evil brother Kahmunrah is threatening to do evil things using the power of a magical tablet that brings museum exhibits to life. During the game's paltry two hours or so, Larry befriends Amelia Earhart, battles Al Capone from atop a skeletal T-rex, pilots a lunar module, and meets an electrifying Ben Franklin, who seems to enjoy his encounters with lightning a bit more than he should. To offer an educational counterpoint to this mishmash of historical mumbo jumbo, historical tidbits appear during loading times, and you can activate exhibit voice-overs as you explore the galleries. It's a weird juxtaposition of fantasy and reality, and it isn't always consistent. For example, a text blurb tells you that Napoleon was actually taller than the average Frenchmen of his time, but in the game, the same Emperor tells you he was of average height. And apparently, the mere mention of a pigeon could send Abe Lincoln on a murderous rampage.      Of course, a game in which you jump into one painting only to come plummeting out of another isn't meant to be taken seriously, and there are some amusing ideas at work here. Your main goal is to piece together the tablet fragments that Kahmunrah has scattered around; each time you retrieve one, you earn a special power. These abilities include taming animals, repairing broken artwork, summoning lightning bolts, and more. In turn, you'll solve puzzles using these skills, which may involve getting a rhinoceros to knock over obelisks of ice to create makeshift ramps, starting up airplane engines to initiate jumping sequences, or jumping through a series of framed masterpieces to retrieve a set of keys. In one charming scene, The Thinker fends off attackers while you make some necessary seating repairs; in another, you use the talents of some hovering cupids to fend off Ivan the Terrible. These scenes are easy to figure out, but they're cute and clever enough to please the game's younger target audience.         Other sequences provide some variety, but they're inconsistent in quality, particularly when platforming is involved. An excursion through a vending machine had potential, but awkward jumping mechanics dull the appeal. The same imprecise controls make for a frustrating jaunt across a series of aircraft. Vehicle-based missions fare no better. Loose controls and inconsistent collision detection make a flight through a warehouse feel choppy and clumsy, and getting in the cockpit of a lunar lander leads to similar gracelessness. Riding around on a big dinosaur skeleton is more fun, but ho-hum sound effects and weak, cartoonish visuals prone to slowdown take away the bite that these moments need to succeed.      There are collectables to gather and trophies to earn for your display case, but there's very little reason to return to Night at the Museum: Battle for the Smithsonian once you're done, which means that you've just relived the film in about the same amount of time it takes to watch, but at four times the cost. It's too bad that the game offers so little value for its price, because it features some nice ideas that should have been taken even further.   "
3028,Gods &amp; Heroes: Rome Rising,5.0,1,"     Lure number one: the world. Gods &amp; Heroes takes place on the Italian peninsula of antiquity, mixing historical elements (the Senate and the baths) with mythological ones (fauns, cyclopes, and the favor of the gods). This good-sized world covers a lot of ground, certainly as much as you would expect from a just-released massively multiplayer online game. And because your initial quests span two large regions, you get a good amount of environmental variety from the start. You come across centaurs early on, giving you a taste of the fantastical straight away, and while initial areas are bog-standard forest paths and beaches, later areas, such as the foggy Venatrix Glades, provide a bit more ambience. Such atmospheric locales are welcome, considering how dated Gods &amp; Heroes looks. On the bright side, a modern PC should be able to run the game at its highest settings, and at a high resolution, and still maintain over 100 frames per second. (Except in areas where the game slows to an inexplicable crawl, such as in your personal estate.) The downside is that the game runs so well because it isn't rendering much worth admiring. Textures are plain, geometry is simple, and the lighting is flat. And lots of details simply don't look right, such as how rain might splash on an invisible surface above you rather than on the ground. Luckily, the soundtrack fills in where the visuals struggle. The calls of horns, exotic bassoon melodies, and string glissandos enrich your travels, as if you might stumble upon Bacchus himself, wallowing in drunken revelry.      Lure number two: your estate. The estate is your own instanced home base, where you can find an armor outfitter for your minions, personal storage, and a few other helpful features. When you first begin, your property is relatively bare, but as you complete estate-related quests, the area begins to take shape. Buildings and architectural features like statues appear as you progress, and there's pleasure in seeing this bare valley morph into a visual expression of your great might; it's as if your estate mirrors your own progress from zero to hero. But while the development team plans to give estates more meaning, for now they are just expansive personal spaces. You can't invite other players or members of your tribe (that is, guild) to join you there and admire your spires. You also can't decide where you want buildings or ornaments to go. (How great would an actual city-building mechanic have been?) It's appealing to watch your estate grow, but at this time, this feature has an enormous amount of untapped potential.      Lure number three: minions. These AI-controlled entities come in three flavors: spellcasters, defenders, and skirmishers. Before level 11 (out of a maximum of 30), you have only one such buddy at your side, though you gain an additional slot at specific levels, eventually taking up to four of them along on your travels. Minions are Gods &amp; Heroes' finest asset, making you feel as if you have a full adventuring party with you even if you aren't grouped with others. This is just as well, as it turns out. The game's population is so small, you could explore for hours without encountering another player, and even the global chat channel goes for long stretches without anyone actually chatting. Gods &amp; Heroes' players are the friendly sort, but it takes some extra effort to explore the game's instanced dungeons, given the community's size.        That effort is almost worth it, however, if only because small group battles seem a lot more hectic when each party member also brings two or three minions along. You add new minions to your available roster by hiring them or earning their loyalty as quest rewards, and eventually you can choose from more than a hundred of them. Some minions heal; others zap enemies with spells; while others poke away at attacking harpies with spears. So no matter which of the game's four classes you choose for your own character (gladiator, mystic, soldier, or priest), chances are you will gain plenty of minions that complement your chosen role. Collecting minions is addictive, in part because they are both more substantial and more tangible than typical MMOG rewards: usually, some experience, a bit of coin, and maybe a helmet that you eventually sell to a vendor a few hours later.     However, your minions don't just give you help; they also give you headaches. Minion AI is an ongoing problem that might have you abandoning certain hirelings simply because they don't perform as they should. Some minions might attack your target when you do, just as they are supposed to, but will refuse to attack subsequent targets in the same battle unless you specifically command them to do so. Other minions refuse to perform their feats (that is, special abilities), making them somewhat useless, because standard minion attacks don't do a lot of damage on their own. Furthermore, while the minion interface includes stances (passive, defensive, aggressive), the aggressive stance doesn't work, though developer Heatwave Interactive handily included the words ""not working"" in the stance description.       There are plenty of other features that could be described as ""not working,"" as it turns out. That doesn't mean that Gods &amp; Heroes is a buggy mess, but it sports a hefty collection of lesser glitches, simple errors, and unfinished features that quickly get under your skin. When you first begin, tutorial icons pop up, but clicking them reveals that there is no actual tutorial text. Certain non-player characters like feat trainers might not be identified onscreen, making it difficult to find them. In one of the most annoying bugs, the game might think you are engaged in combat even when you aren't, prohibiting you from interacting with quest objects and other items, and forcing you to close the game and restart it. And there are tons of issues with geometry and surfaces within the world. You can peek through holes in mountains and even fall through holes in roofs, which causes you to get stuck. (At least you can use the /unstuck command to spawn elsewhere should that happen.) Roaming enemies might clip through bridges rather than walking over them, and your minions might walk on water rather than swim in it. These aren't enormous issues, but there are so many of them that Gods &amp; Heroes feels simultaneously old and unfinished.            Fortunately, there are heaps and heaps of quests to keep you busy, so you're never stuck fighting for fighting's sake: there's always context for your actions. The quest writing isn't particularly notable. Quest givers provide purpose, sometimes with historical and mythological perspective, but there is no overarching narrative to give you a greater sense of direction. The quests themselves are fine, though, if occasionally lacking creativity. You might be excited to arrive in Rome for the first time, only to find a series of fetch quests awaiting you, and no other players in town. And you've likely already killed countless scorpions and snakes in other such games. Nevertheless, the questing is fine, and quest providers send you all over the world, protecting mythic stags from attack, looking for shallow graves, and adding poison to wine flasks. Finding quest items can be somewhat of a pain, however. Items you need to collect aren't visually identified onscreen (such as by a subtle glow, as you might expect), or even on the minimap--only on the main map. This can make locating key objects like moss-covered rocks a real pain, since they blend in with the environment. You end up hovering your mouse over the ground until you discover what you need--the MMOG equivalent of pixel hunting.     "
651,Madden NFL 20,8.0,2,"Continuing the Madden franchise's recent tradition of story modes, Madden NFL 20 introduces a new narrative campaign. This new mode generally falls flat, but the pro football sim stands out on the field, with new additions that faithfully capture the essence of the NFL experience while making it fun to play again and again.The new story mode, QB1: Face of the Franchise, replaces the Longshot story mode that was featured in Madden 18 and 19. Unlike those campaigns, which featured a pre-set character, Madden 20's QB1 mode lets you create an entirely unique football star and guide him through the final stages of his collegiate career with the hopes of making an NFL starting roster, and, on a longer timeline, complete a journey to hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the Super Bowl.QB1's story picks up as you decide which college to attend and play for. However, the college football elements within Madden 20 are not anything significant. You select a school from 10 options, including heavyweights like Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Clemson. It's a treat to see fully licensed college football teams, complete with true-to-life jerseys, logos, stadiums, and marching band songs, but the gameplay experience in reality is limited to two games in the College Football Playoffs--and you can't play the college teams in quickplay later on.After winning the National Championship against all odds, you're off to the NFL Combine where your performance in front of scouts and GMs determines how high you go in the draft. There are some genuinely funny moments here with your aloof agent Les Moore, and interactions with him are some of the best character moments in the story mode. After making it to the NFL, the game then disappointingly becomes the standard Franchise mode, except your character has more backstory that acts as fuel to drive you to succeed on the field. That's the idea, at least; in practice, it leaves much to be desired.In part, that's because QB1's cinematic cutscenes and Telltale-style choices end once you get to the NFL. At that point, the narrative beats play out through text messages you receive from fans and other players from around the league. This delivery method makes conversations awkward and ultimately forgettable. There is one storyline in particular involving a sick child rooting for you that falls flat; it tries too hard to tug on your heartstrings, moody piano pieces and all, without earning any payoff. Without giving too much away, another major storyline in QB1 involves your college teammate and friend, and it ends abruptly, with the strong suggestion that the story will continue in Madden NFL 21. That's too bad, because this character, in the limited screen time he gets, is far more interesting than the cookie-cutter, run-of-the-mill one you create.In general, QB1 moves at such a fast pace that it doesn't allow for thoughtful character development. Not only that, but the story that QB1 does tell is hokey and clumsily unraveled. The story overall feels barebones and incomplete, with the entirety of the QB1 mode feeling like a half-baked idea in the end.Despite the lackluster story and the way it's delivered, QB1 succeeds in connecting you to your on-field performance and inspiring you to improve or play differently each week once you've made it to the NFL. The text message system, while not the best avenue for full conversation, is better utilized in delivering week-to-week objectives and challenges. You can complete these to earn XP, which you can then invest into your character in an RPG-lite-like system where you choose which aspects of your game you want to develop.As an example, I responded with some trash talk against one of the league's best cornerbacks, Richard Sherman, and my Game Day Goal, as it's called, was to achieve 400 yards or more of offense and a 60-yard pass--not an easy task with Sherman in the backfield. The system is dynamic and responsive to what happens on the field week-to-week, and this is a nice touch that provides a further level of connection to your character and their status in the league.Madden 20's standard Franchise mode, which is separate from the QB1 mode, gets a welcome update this year. Its implementation of the new Scenario Engine, which lets you interact with players and coaches through the aforementioned text-message system, is the best new feature for Franchise. Like with QB1, having weekly objectives that you decide on is a compelling way to keep you interested and engaged in a 16+ week season that can otherwise get monotonous and repetitive. However, Franchise mode overall doesn't get any other significant or meaningful updates this year, which might be a bummer for seasoned players wanting more.Perhaps the biggest and most exciting change for Madden 20 are the new X-Factor and Superstar abilities. 50 of the league's best players have been given these super abilities, and they revamp the fundamentals of Madden playmaking. X-Factor abilities are unlocked when you meet the qualifications to get ""in the zone""--for some QBs, it's throwing for 5 or more yards in the air multiple times without making a mistake--while Superstar abilities are passive traits tied to your player that are always active.The new X-Factor abilities are truly game-changers, and they further emphasize the distinction between the average NFL player and elite athletes. For example, the Gambler X-Factor ability--which only Aaron Rodgers has--makes it impossible for AI defenders to intercept his passes. Similarly powerful X-Factor abilities are available for defenders as well, and that helps balance things out. Not only that, but X-Factor abilities can be lost quickly; a QB who takes a sack is immediately out of the zone, while dropped passes and fumbles also cancel out these abilities.These abilities, when combined with an elite player like Madden 20 cover star Patrick Mahomes (who has incredible baseline stats to begin with), become overly powerful in some instances. Mahomes' unique passive Superstar abilities give him immense speed and dexterity out of the pocket, on top of his already powerful and accurate arm. When teammate Travis Kelce unlocks his own X-Factor ability (which gives him a guaranteed aggressive catch on any single-man coverage), it becomes simply too easy to complete big plays down the field.Outside of that issue, the new X-Factor and Superstar abilities introduce a level of strategy that the Madden series has never seen. I found myself often weighing up whether I should pursue the X-Factor qualification conditions or choose lower-risk plays that are more likely to be successful. At pivotal stages, like in the fourth quarter or in a third-and-long situation, this level of risk/reward is heightened. Not only that, but with 50 X-Factor abilities spread across players on the 32 NFL teams, it encourages you to try new teams and strategies.Importantly, X-Factor abilities do not feel gimmicky or too overpowerful for the most part as they're difficult to unlock and have numerous counters. Stephon Gilmore of the New England Patriots, for example, has an X-Factor ability called Acrobat that allows him to perform a diving move where he makes an incredible pass breakup. Some pass-rushers, too, including Aaron Donald of the Los Angeles Rams, can shred the defense and break the O-Line easily to sack the quarterback for a big loss. The saying ""any given Sunday"" is truer than ever in Madden 20 thanks to the X-Factor abilities.Overall, the on-field action in Madden this year is better than ever. The game provides more on-screen info than last year's iteration, making it easier to see things like decision-making specifics (such as average yards-per-play or yards given up) and which elite offensive and defensive players have X-Factor and Superstar abilities. This makes for an easy way to help you see the odds of having success with a play before the snap. The playbook menus (and menus overall, for that matter) are cleaned up and brighter, which helps you see important information at a glance.Also new this year are Run-Pass Options added to playbooks. These hybrid plays provide yet another way for play-callers to mix things up and keep defenders guessing. There are also numerous player-specific animations, including Aaron Rodgers' signature quick release and Patrick Mahomes' sidearm throw. This all works together to make Madden 20 closer than ever to replicating the look and feel of actual pro football. Nothing in the updated gameplay mechanics for Madden 20 is as substantial as the introduction of Real Player Motion from last year, but the controls in Madden are as good as they've ever been thanks to further refinement on last year's improvements and the introduction of some welcome tweaks and small changes. A subtle gameplay change for 2019 is that you can double press the receiver icon to pump fake; this small change makes it easier than ever to trick a defender into biting on a pass route, providing yet another level of depth and control.The core fundamentals that underpin Madden 20's gameplay feel more solid and dependable than ever. Mistakes like poor passes, missed tackles, and bad decision-making are yours and yours alone to own because the controls rarely, if ever, let you down.Also notable for Madden 20 is what's (generally) not there: bugs. After many hours with the game, I only experienced a handful of minor glitches, though your mileage may vary, and it's worth noting that you can continue to expect other oddities like out-of-place commentary and some sideline players executing the same animations all the time. I also experienced what felt like an unusually high number of facemask calls and injuries.Now in its third year using EA's Frostbite engine, Madden 20 also looks very good with its better-looking player models that have richer detail and more realistic flourishes (except for Greg Olsen; what happened there?). The Madden 20 game engine also provides gorgeous environmental effects like glistening sun rays peeking through the clouds and casting shadows on the field and snow effects that limit your vision and force you to suggest playing more conservatively to accommodate for the wintry conditions.The commentary team composed of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis also return in Madden 20, and they are consistently a treat to listen to. Despite some lines being repeated from time to time (how many times do we have to hear that Julian Edelman was a quarterback in college or that Tom Brady was initially drafted to play baseball?), the pair deliver the right mixture of lines that keep you informed and engaged in equal measure. Madden 20's overall broadcast, presentation, and gameplay packages aim to replicate the real-life NFL experience, but it continues to be a shame that the voicelines--at least all the ones I heard in over 20 hours with Madden 20--do not comment on real-world NFL issues. As with previous years, the commentary will be updated regularly throughout the season.Among Madden 20's other modes is the fantasy team-building card-based Ultimate Team, and this continues to be the game's richest when it comes to the sheer multitude of challenges to complete. It remains a thrill to build a fantasy team and compete either against other fantasy AI teams or the world at large through online play.A subtle yet enjoyable change for MUT this year is how you can move from one challenge to the next without returning to the menu screen, which is great considering how many there are to complete. There is also a new ""Mission"" system that helps you select the right challenges to complete in order to acquire items for your deck. In years past, MUT could feel like a hard-to-parse system that you slogged through waywardly, but the new system gives you more direction, and as such it is more respectful of your time.Ultimate Team does have issues with microtransactions, however. At the very start, the tutorial instructs you to visit the store where you can make real-money purchases, which feels like an unnecessary nudge toward spending extra. As with past iterations of MUT, it can feel like a grind to get the cards you want, which in turn encourages you to consider spending money on microtransactions when you otherwise might not. That rubbed me the wrong way, but MUT overall is still an enjoyable and engaging mode that I expect to return to again and again.Madden NFL 20 is an improved version of the annualized professional football series that excels in some areas and leaves something to be desired in others. The new QB1 career mode--which includes a barebones NCAA football experience--overall feels like a half-baked idea that doesn't deliver anything meaningful or interesting. When it comes to the on-the-field action, however, the new X-Factor and Superstar abilities shake up the familiar gameplay formula to give seasoned players and newcomers alike a fresh way to scheme plays and orchestrate strategy on both sides of the ball."
1716,Resident Evil: Revelations 2,7.0,2," Though Revelations 2 starts with a whimper, at least it doesn't waste any time getting you into the game. Right as they were starting to enjoy a swanky company party, Resident Evil hall-of-famer Claire Redfield, and her co-worker, young Moira Burton, are kidnapped at gunpoint and shipped off to a wretched penal colony on a remote island. The game begins when Claire awakens in a damp cell, and the mystery kicks off when the door opens moments later, seemingly on its own. Their imprisonment is clearly the work of someone who fancies control as they're taunted over the PA system by a mysterious overseer. She speaks in very vague terms, introducing more questions than answers. By and large, Revelations 2 likes to keep you guessing. Moira's father, the ever memorable Barry Burton from the original Resident Evil, attempts to come to Moira and Claire's rescue. With the help of a young companion, the mysterious Natalia, he searches the same prison, but the enemies he faces are quite different, acting more like classic zombies as they shuffle along, rather than the speedy juggernauts that hunt Claire and Moira. This setup affords you two points of view within the same nightmare, and slightly different gameplay experiences, but not all things are created equal. Barry's act is far stronger than Claire's, not only because it offers the best moments of tension, but because his companion is a far better compliment than Moira ever is to Claire. Working in tandem is at the heart of everything you do in Revelations 2, for better and for worse. You can switch between your two characters on the fly, and sometimes you must in order to solve simple environmental puzzles. Moira's flashlight may uncover a hidden item that you need to proceed, and Natalia can go places that Barry can't thanks to her small stature. Unfortunately for Claire, Moira's not much use outside of a few strict scenarios that call upon her unique abilities. She looks capable of manning a gun, but a tragic event from her past conveniently prevents her from doing so here. She comes in handy when she pries open a rare door or blinds an occasional enemy, but she's otherwise dead weight and a near constant source of bad dialog as she spouts vulgarity after vulgarity. It's not hard to take in because it's offensive; it's obvious that she's meant to sound young and brash. However, she comes off as an exaggerated caricature that sticks out like a sore thumb. Outside of a few important plot points, the only helpful thing Moira brings to the table is a flashlight, but Natalia has a subtle personality that comes across as a breath of fresh air and she's far more useful during tense situations. She can sneak by enemies undetected and crawl into tight spaces. If Barry is low on health, Natalia is a solid backup, trading head-on action for simple but effective stealth. Though she lacks the firepower, Natalia proves to be even more useful than her caretaker at times, so long as she remains undetected by the bad guys. Natalia and Barry's stint is the best source of tension in the game by a long shot. For the most part, Claire and Moira are stuck inside their prison, which is predictable and boring. On the contrary, Barry and Natalia spend a lot of time outside, and in the middle of the night, with only a few light sources off in the distance, a sense of dread creeps in when you wander into the unknown. Natalia is the best candidate for the job given her ability to spot enemies from a distance, but you always know in the back of your mind that she's practically incapable of defending herself apart from throwing a brick at an enemy, yet there you are, meters deep into a dark forest teeming with horrific abominations that want nothing more than to eat you alive. When an enemy takes multiple rounds from a gun to stagger, a brick offers little solace. You can tackle the campaign via local co-op with a friend if you're so inclined, but your teammate has to come to terms with the fact that they're playing second fiddle. Teaming up is an effective means of getting through the campaign quickly because you aren't reliant on AI to watch your back, and you have the ability to multitask, but the split screen view and real world chatter can dilute the tension. If you're looking to get scared, playing solo is the only way to go. There are a few puzzles to solve during each scenario that are reminiscent of classic Resident Evil moments, but instead of having to consider all of your options and search for a solution, it's given to you in the form of a simple task. Ultimately, these moments feel like chores rather than puzzle solving opportunities. Moira's asked to point a flashlight around a room to find a key, for example, testing your patience rather than your intellect. If anything, these quandaries feel like justifications for having a sidekick. Perhaps it's good that it's not as obtuse as some games in the series' past, but the formula has been simplified too much for its own good. If you find your trigger finger itching after beating the first episode, you can hop into the optional and oddly enjoyable raid mode. This arcade-like experience pits you against small armies of enemies in various environments from this and future episodes, and you're encouraged to take advantage of your firepower. The more enemies you kill and the more efficient you are at doing so, the better rewards you receive, often in the form of additional weapons. It's a very different experience than the main game, especially with it's initially jarring dance soundtrack, but it's a fun diversion that gives you plenty to do once the rather short campaign comes to an end. Though you have to wade through mediocre puzzles and endure cringe-worthy dialogue and references to past games, episode one successfully entices you to look forward to the next episode. Just before you feel like its antics are wearing you down, it commands your attention by redeeming itself during the second half, just before sealing the deal with an impactful cliffhanger. With tastes of both classic and modern Resident Evil, Revelations 2 has something for everyone, but it would be served better if it was a little more focused and had a little less Moira.  "
3508,Space Ark (2010),6.0,1,"     Space Ark's starting premise puts you in charge of the Arkonauts, animal astronauts on a mission to save the galaxy after a rogue black hole has swung through the neighborhood and wiped out all of the non-cuddly life-forms. Your goal is to terraform planets so that they are once more safe for the little fuzzballs to live on. But this isn't quite the daunting task that it seems to be at first glance. All you do to revive the game's dead worlds is crack open egg-shaped stasis capsules hosting uber-adorable animals (such as tigers, zebras, and turtles) and then use a bounce pad to boing them around the planet's surface with the goal of collecting multicolored DNA crystals. The objective of each level is to soar around grabbing all of these floating crystals in a set number of combo strings of at least three in a row of the same color. Hit terra firma, and you both lose a life and control over all of your combos, which trail behind you like balloons on a string. Wrap things up successfully, and a portal opens up to the next level, where you do it all over again.     And again. And again. And again. There are five planets in the Mission mode campaign, featuring a whopping 168 levels, which can be played solo or in split-screen multiplayer locally (there is no online support over Live). Even though each of these levels can generally be finished in no more than a few minutes, you still get a ton of content for just 800 XBL points. You can also take part in Time Attack and Survival scenarios where you try to beat the clock. But length is probably the best thing that Space Ark has going for it. While the gameplay is undeniably catchy, thanks to a great rhythm where you guide your animal projectile with one stick and slide the jumping pad back and forth with the other, it's sort of a one-trick pony that loses its appeal after a couple of hours.  The first problem is that the game is simplistic. Most levels offer little serious challenge to anyone experienced with block puzzle games going back to the likes of Arkanoid and Breakout. That said, the difficulty is perfect for younger people and casual players who like their games light and easy. The game gets tougher as you go along, mostly due to trickier jumps and the need to jump more carefully in order to meet the number of combos required to beat each level. But even then there isn't much that will make you sweat. The very toughest jumps require no small amount of finesse, although you can usually knock them off in a minute or two at most.        Another snag is presented by the look and sound of the game: everything is cloyingly cute. Arkonauts have big sparkly eyes and chubby stuffed-animal limbs, and they tend to smile constantly while making nonstop peppy moves like twirling in the air and giving high-fives to nonexistent pals. Planet backdrops are nicely mixed up with different terrain types that range from a jungle world to a place that looks like Hoth. Still, the scenery is filled in with primary colors so bright that you wouldn't want to play this game with a hangover. The soundtrack is from the Up With People school of music-making, all bouncy and poppy if a lot less in your face (ears?) than the visuals. All in all, it's tough to endure the whole package. The graphics and audio assault you with cuteness, making it hard for anybody past puberty to play for long without feeling a vague sense of shame.   "
1985,Demon Gaze,7.0,2,"Wizardry-inspired import featuring overtly sexed-up still images, but behind those initially off-putting images lies a robust, well-made adventure with a lot of depth. You begin Demon Gaze by waking up in the bottom of a dungeon. You have no idea why you are here, but you hear strange, childlike laughter off in the distance. As you try to escape your surroundings, you encounter a battle-scarred warrior woman. She gives you a weapon and tells you to face the source of the voice--a vicious, bloodthirsty demon. It's in this battle that your initial abilities are revealed: you have the gifts of a gazer, an individual capable of subduing and controlling demons. Soon, you discover more about your odd situation. You've signed a contract to board at the Dragon Princess Inn, an unusual safe haven in a dangerous region. The local mercenaries make their living doing menial jobs in the hazardous ruins, but Fran, the inn's manager, has a different job for you: to capture all of the demons wreaking havoc in the surrounding lands. A complicated task becomes even more wrought with drama as the secrets of your lineage, Fran's ambiguous motives and strange behavior, and the actions of the unusual characters that inhabit the inn intertwine. Each character has his or her own reasons for being at the Dragon Princess Inn, but ultimately, it is Fran's guidance that binds the cast together. Unfortunately, as part of the story, Fran sometimes gives you mundane tasks you must do before you can proceed into new areas, and during these times, the narrative slows to a patience-trying crawl. Demon Gaze's blatant pandering may also test your patience. Scantily dressed non-player characters like Lancelorna and Prometh, along with cutscenes showing a nearly naked Fran, make it clear that the game seeks to titillate. That pandering can be difficult to stomach (Did we really need to see Fran's maid secretly sniffing her panties?), but the baring of skin isn't limited to the female characters; there are suggestively dressed and more modest character creation art choices for guys and ladies, and one of the more frequent skin-baring characters is Lezarem, the item shop's handsome elf proprietor. Even so, I was surprised at how much I came to like a lot of these characters despite behavior I found initially off-putting. A complicated task becomes even more wrought with drama as the secrets of your lineage, Fran's ambiguous motives and strange behavior, and the actions of the unusual characters that inhabit the inn intertwine. Etrian Odyssey series, you can't use the touchscreen to draw boundaries or place your own icons on the map. Souls games: anyone playing Demon Gaze can write a memo using preprogrammed phrases, where it appears in other players' games at that spot. These can be used to share locations of hidden doors and treasures, give directions, warn of impending dangers, or just convey idle chatter, making the exploration experience feel more communal. Another noteworthy presence in the dungeons of Demon Gaze is the circles. Circles serve a variety of purposes and are key to your success. Their first role is as checkpoints, and you must take control of every circle in a dungeon before you can fight that dungeon's demon in its final form. They also act as points where you can save and swap out the demon keys you've earned. What you mostly use them for, though, is collecting loot. By setting gems corresponding to different item types on the circle, you initiate a battle with monsters that are guaranteed to drop the items you specified. This makes the process of loot hunting considerably easier and much more fun, since you always know what you're getting out of combat. Need some light armor for your wizard? Set a bunch of light armor gems on circles around the dungeon and see what you get. Of course, the quality of the goods isn't always guaranteed, but there's plenty you can do with even subpar loot: you can sell it, sacrifice it to power up your higher-quality gear, or, given that the circles are save points, reload your progress and try your luck again. Combat also presents some unique twists. The boss demons you have defeated are transformed into keys, and the gazer character has a special command menu to release demons during fights. Demons have their own health, loyalty levels, and skill sets, and behave according to their own whims. While demons don't have magic points, being in battle uses up stored energy from a demon gauge. (You can also command the demons to perform specific actions--even when not on-field--at a significant gauge cost.) If the gauge runs dry, the demons transform and run wild, attacking both friend and foe indiscriminately for massive damage, so keeping tabs on how you use them is crucial. Their presence adds an interesting dimension to both combat and exploration; demons you bring with you can also grant passive field bonuses, such as revealing hidden doors or preventing health loss on floors that damage you. Need some light armor for your wizard? Set a bunch of light armor gems on circles around the dungeon and see what you get. But even with demonic forces on your side, combat can get pretty tough. Key to your survival is the use of your team's special skills. These are acquired through gaining levels, and most skills are learned based on the character's class. However, rare artifact items come imbued with their own skills. You can equip these on a character who can make use of the artifact's skill regardless of their class. This can be used to create otherwise impossible skill combinations--for example, giving a damage-shield creation ability to a fighter--or to grant abilities to characters much earlier than they would be naturally learned. Using artifact skills in tandem with innate character skills opens up a plethora of interesting strategies, though it's hampered by the relative rarity and costliness of gems needed to obtain artifacts. The ease of loot collecting and gear enhancing combined with entertaining combat makes exploration in Demon Gaze enjoyable. Things are a bit tough initially--and a very dry translation on the game's assorted help screens doesn't work in the game's favor--but after a bit of dungeon crawling and party building, Demon Gaze settles into a nice difficulty level that is challenging but rarely feels unfair. Yes, you'll probably lose the first time you fight certain bosses, but carefully looking at what went wrong and reevaluating your approach gets you results. And if that still doesn't work, there's an option to alter the game's difficulty level whenever you want.     Demon Gaze is not a game for those looking for fast, easy rewards; you need a great deal of patience to find success, and sometimes it feels like the game's narrative is actively working against your desire to progress to new places. But when you are narrowly clutching victory from the jaws of defeat, laying waste to a challenging foe through party synergy and clever planning, or finding an incredibly rare piece of loot that completely changes how you use a party member, you feel like your efforts have yielded delicious fruit."
3535,UFC Undisputed 2010,8.0,2,"  Inside the octagon, there really wasn't a lot wrong with UFC 2009 Undisputed, which makes it all the more impressive that the combat in UFC 2010 Undisputed is so much better. New features and improvements aren't confined to the cage, either. When you're not busy punching, pummeling, or posturing, you can create a custom fighter who's no longer restricted by styles, play through a far less clunky (though still problematic) Career mode, and shop for trading cards and unlockables using points earned in all-new modes. Some of the new features have come with problems, but despite some drawbacks, UFC 2010 Undisputed is definitely a bigger and better game than its predecessor. Its fighting system is deep, but it's also accessible enough that you don't need to be a fan of mixed martial arts to enjoy it.       Regardless of whether or not you played last year's game, you'd do well to check out UFC 2010's Tutorial mode before jumping into the octagon to do battle with one of the 100-plus (as opposed to last year's 41) UFC fighters. The mostly intuitive controls are largely unchanged: Your limbs are still mapped to the four face buttons, shoulder buttons are still used for blocking and modifying attacks, and the right analog stick still has a number of different uses, depending on whether you're fighting stand-up, in a clinch, or on the ground. There are several new techniques and strategies for you to master this year, though, and while none of them are complicated, you're better off learning about them in the impressively thorough tutorial than in a fight when one of them is used against you.         After initiating one of the numerous different submissions with a quick click of the right analog stick, both players then rotate the stick as quickly as possible in an attempt to end the submission favorably. This inelegant system (referred to in-game as ""the shine"") works in much the same way that it did last year, except that as the guy being submitted, you now have to watch for your opponent transitioning from one submission hold to another. If that happens, you need to shine in the opposite direction. If you fail to do so, you're treated to an extreme close-up of the improved fighter likenesses and animation as the camera zooms in--getting closer and closer as the submission looks increasingly likely to end the fight. The improved visuals and camera work make the ground game more compelling and even a little easier to understand than it was last year, but if you prefer strikes to submissions, there's a good chance you'll still do your best to avoid it.      Unlike their counterparts in last year's game, UFC 2010 fighters aren't limited to using one grappling style along with one striking style. If you're creating a finished fighter, you choose from one of nine ""technique templates"" (Japanese MMA or Boxing, for example) and then have the option to customize your repertoire by trading in the moves that you don't want for points and then spending those points on moves that you do want. It's a great system because it lets you create fighters that specialize in your favorite moves--even if those moves span a number of very different disciplines. Career mode takes a similar approach, except that you don't even get to choose a technique when creating your character; you start out as something of a jack-of-all-trades and then earn skill points and new moves by taking part in training activities between fights.       Last year's Career mode was bogged down with unwieldy menus to the point that you spent more time navigating them than you did inside the octagon. Thankfully, that's not the case this year, but while the Career mode is much-improved and introduces some good features, it still has its fair share of problems. One neat change is that rather than being thrust into the UFC from day one, you now get to take part in up to five amateur fights (these are a great opportunity to experiment with the four difficulty settings) before turning pro and competing in the World Fighting Alliance. The WFA fighters aren't nearly as formidable as the guys in the UFC, so beating them and getting invited to join the UFC is just a formality. The important thing at this early stage of your career is that you use the weeks between fights wisely; otherwise you're liable to get destroyed in your first Ultimate Fight Night undercard. Sadly, while it's more important than ever and has been improved somewhat, training in UFC 2010 still isn't much fun. Strength, speed, and cardio training are still entirely menu driven; the most effective way to spar is to employ cheap tactics, and visiting camps to learn new moves is more often frustrating than it is fun. You need to devote a lot of time to training in Career mode this year because even as a young fighter, any stats and skills that you don't invest points in on a regular basis start to deteriorate.           When you're not training or competing, it's generally because you're in need of rest, which--like just about everything else in Career mode--takes a full week. This includes media-related activities like making fight predictions and sparring in front of the press. The need to balance your conditioning with your fatigue level and to keep them as close to 100 and zero, respectively, on the week of your fight is a constant and realistic concern. Other stats to keep an eye on in Career mode include your popularity (as influenced by media activities, post-fight interviews, and the like), which has an impact on sponsorship deals, and your cred. Cred goes up after every fight (depending on the result and on which sponsor logos you adorn your shorts with) and unlocks gym upgrades and new sparring partners. These make your training more effective and raise the level caps on your physical attributes and skills. Despite the aforementioned problems, it's certainly easy to get sucked into UFC 2010's 12-year Career mode. You always feel like you're progressing, and while the weeks in between fights aren't much fun, the fights themselves are still great, and it's always very satisfying to win because you feel like your hard work has paid off.         If you're a fan of the UFC, you're sure to get a kick out of the other single-player mode as well. Ultimate Fights affords you an opportunity to relive or rewrite history in a number of classic fights (15 on the Xbox 360, 20 on the PlayStation 3) that date as far back as 2005's UFC 51. There are nine challenges to complete for each fighter, which include a good combination of easy (perform three successful takedowns) and reasonably difficult (win by rear naked choke in first round) objectives. Successful completion of these challenges provides one of a few different ways that you can earn credits to spend on additional customization options for your fighters, and it also unlocks highlight videos of the fights in question, which look great on the PS3 but are poorly compressed on the Xbox 360. Incidentally, the PS3 version also includes five full-length, high-definition UFC fights on the disc.    should be the training sessions where you pair up with another team member, but in practice, they're just pointless and frustrating. You don't always get credit for completing the very specific exercises that your presented with, playing as the trainer involves a lot of standing around and letting yourself get hit in the hope that you can gain a meaningless trainer level online, and even if you succeed as the trainee, your only reward is a miniscule amount of cred that's unlikely to have any impact on your fighter in Career mode.        Clearly, UFC 2010 Undisputed is a game with its fair share of problems. You shouldn't let that put you off, though, because this is also a game that brilliantly re-creates the mixed martial arts combat that has made the UFC so popular and that boasts a roster of more than 100 great-looking contemporary fighters (as well as three bonus classic fighters on the PS3). Last year's problems have mostly been addressed, new problems have been introduced, and the end result is a game that--much like its predecessor 12 months ago--is difficult to fault inside the octagon but falls short of expectations between fights.   Editor's Note: The preceding review previously contained erroneous information about the visibility of the new skill deterioration system in Career mode. GameSpot regrets the error.  "
4010,Carmen Sandiego: The Secret of the Stolen Drums,5.0,1," Let's get one important thing out of the way right out of the gate: If you're expecting Carmen Sandiego: The Secret of the Stolen Drums to be anything like the Broderbund-developed Carmen Sandiego edutainment games of old, you're going to be phenomenally disappointed by what this game has to offer. In fact, even if you're a fan of this game's genre--3D platformers--you're still going to be disappointed. The Secret of the Stolen Drums is a mediocre game across the board, offering nothing new or even remotely entertaining and instead putting you through the paces of Generic Platformer 101. This isn't the worst game you'll ever play, but that doesn't mean it's worth your time.      In this latest Carmen Sandiego adventure, you play as Cole Gannon, an in-training operative of the ACME detective agency who must track Carmen across nine countries on the hunt for a set of stolen tribal drums that will unlock the key to some form of ultimate power, and so on and so forth. Those of you with high hopes of being able to track Carmen the old-fashioned way--with some solid geography education--are going to be brutally rebuffed. There is no real educational element to Stolen Drums, save for a few blurbs before each new level that give you a brief tutorial on the country you're about to visit. However, none of this information ever comes into play during the game, and really it's about the educational equivalent of tossing a carrot stick into a bowl of Lucky Charms for added nutrition. It makes little to no impact.   As a 3D platformer, Stolen Drums gives you all the obligatory abilities, like double jumping, a basic weapon to attack with (a big stick, in this case), and a couple of little special abilities, like a pole-vault maneuver you can use to traverse larger gaps. You can also go into ""stealth mode"" on command, which is supposedly necessary against certain enemies who can be attacked only from behind (specifically, enemies of the robot variety--yes, Carmen Sandiego has robots now). Fortunately, their artificial intelligence is generally very bad, so if you are spotted, you simply need to duck behind the nearest corner and they'll lose track of you. The stealth mechanics aren't the only irritating thing about the gameplay, either--there's also the horrid control of Cole. The analog control of Cole's movements is extremely loose, which ultimately leads to a whole lot of missed jumps, simply because you can't get a good hold on Cole.    If it weren't for these control hang-ups and periodic moments of poorly  executed stealth gameplay, Stolen Drums would be an exceptionally easy game. Despite offering you an array of gadgets to use--such as a map, a GPS system to track Carmen's movements with, and a communication system to talk to your fellow ACME agents with--the game doesn't really ever factor them into the gameplay. For example, the GPS system is entirely based on collecting a series of ""clues"" throughout each level, and nothing more. There is no requirement on your part to actually track down Carmen, as it's done for you once you pick up all the items. Other than picking up these items, all you really have to do from level to level is solve a few idiotically simple puzzles, beat up a few bad guys, and then move on to the next level. Five hours later, you're done, and no better for it.      There's very little to say about Stolen Drums' presentation, as it's fairly obvious that neither graphics nor sound were a big focus during this game's development. The look of the game is somewhat similar to the old Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? cartoon series, featuring a few animated cutscenes of middling quality here and there. The in-game visuals are pretty bare-bones, with minimal amounts of animation and similarly bland level designs. Even the technical aspects, like the frame rate and camera, don't hold up. Little bouts of frame-rate drop pop up all over the place in all three versions of the game, and the freewheeling camera is just plain bad, getting hung up on pieces of the scenery constantly, and never moving into a proper angle no matter what the situation. Of further note, there are no appreciable differences between the three console versions of Stolen Drums, control-wise or graphically--so you're going to experience the same issues across the board. The only real audio of note in the game are the bouts of dialogue between Cole, his colleagues, and Carmen that you'll encounter from time to time. None of it is very good, but it isn't the most awkward voice acting you'll ever hear.   It's plainly obvious that The Secret of the Stolen Drums is aimed squarely at younger gamers, but even so, this game is pretty unimpressive. The controls are likely to frustrate younger players even more than experienced platformer fans, and the lack of even a modicum of challenge and the relative brevity of the game make this a pretty lousy package overall. To sum it all up, don't go into The Secret of the Stolen Drums thinking you're going to get an educational game or an enjoyable platformer, as you'll find neither here. "
4678,Frank Herbert's Dune,3.0,0,"Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the towering monuments of imaginative fiction. This massive novel brings feudalism to the far future, creating an unforgettable story of a messianic hero, political intrigue and betrayal, mysticism, and more. Not surprisingly, Dune has spawned a number of games and films. On the gaming side, Westwood's Dune II helped create the real-time strategy genre on the PC back in 1992, and it was followed by a number of sequels, like the recent Emperor: Battle for Dune. With movies, Dune fans were first treated (or subjected as the case may be) to David Lynch's controversial 1984 adaptation, which was visually unforgettable but infamously incoherent. More recently, SCI FI Channel ran a six-hour miniseries called Frank Herbert's Dune. Directed by John Harrison, this Emmy-winning adaptation unquestionably stuck closer to the spirit, if not the letter, of the source material than Lynch's version did. It also featured some fine acting and high production values. Now Dune films and games meet in Frank Herbert's Dune, a tie-in for the miniseries. Unfortunately, it's a poorly designed 3D action-adventure game that actually has precious little to do with the miniseries and equally little to recommend it.   In the game, you'll assume the role of young Paul Atreides, scion of a noble house that's been sent to administer the desert planet, Arrakis, also known as Dune. Dune is the source of the invaluable spice that lies at the core of civilization, commerce, and space travel. With the aid of the Emperor, the evil House Harkonnen plots against the Atreides family, resulting in the death of Paul's father the Duke, as well as most of the royal house. Paul and his mother, Jessica, survive by escaping to the desert. The game plays out during the time that Paul and Jessica spend among the fierce desert warriors known as the Fremen, as they bide their time for revenge against the Harkonnen. You'll lead Paul from a third-person viewpoint as he carries out raids on Harkonnen and spice smuggler bases.   You'll quickly learn that just trying to move Paul during these missions can be a real chore. Throughout the game, he constantly gets caught on objects and other characters, even when he's only in their general vicinity, and the camera is often blocked by walls, rocks, and other objects. In the horribly ill-conceived second mission, you're forced to avoid a giant sandworm by actually running toward the camera, into its blind spot. That wouldn't necessarily be so bad--as awkward as it is--if it weren't for the fact the ground is littered with hard-to-spot patches of quicksand.   That sort of poor design carries over to the majority of the game. To view detailed information about your inventory items, you need to cycle through a slow-moving, clumsily animated menu system. Just trying to start a new game can be a hassle because of the awkward interface for naming your game session. You have to scroll through letters like you do in a console game interface instead of just typing them in. The game is also beset with lengthy load times, a lack of difficulty levels, and the inability to save the game during the overly lengthy missions.   The structure of the actual missions isn't handled well either. These story-based tasks contain a mixture of stealth, action, and light puzzle solving, and the tension from sneaking around can be genuinely enjoyable in brief spurts. However, instead of mainly having to use your head or your reflexes, you'll often need to resort to blind trial and error. You'll also find that the missions play almost identically every time: The utterly moronic guards will be standing in the same places and will appear out of thin air every time you activate a hidden trigger. The missions would play a lot better if the guards you needed to kill patrolled more, letting you gauge their movements so that you could sneak past them or eliminate them from behind. Many just stand there, though, forcing head-on confrontations.  Once a guard starts firing at you, you inexplicably can't attack with your knife anymore, even if you're literally right next to him. When you're then forced to use a gun instead, get ready for one of the game's many letdowns. Ranged combat is so simplistic and unrealistic as to be comical, with two characters basically standing in place and repeatedly shooting at each other until one falls. The game also offers precious few opportunities to restock your ammo.   During your missions, you'll need to watch Paul's life level, refilling it with a stock of water from his stillsuit, which is inexplicably called a ""distiller."" (New names and spellings for Dune terms are common in the game.) By sneaking up on a guard and eliminating him with one quick knife blow, Paul can reclaim the guard's water. It's a clever twist on the usual med kit or health pack cliché, and one that nicely ties into the Dune mythology, where water is the second most-precious thing on Dune after the spice.   Between and during the missions, you'll watch lengthy, poorly directed, in-engine cutscenes that do a hit-and-miss job of explaining the situation and your goals. The dialogue is utterly boring or just plain silly, and the game takes major liberties with both the miniseries and novel. When you restart a mission, as you'll likely have to, you'll be subjected to all the cutscenes again with no way to skip them.   Between missions, you're also forced to saunter around the Fremen hideouts, seeking new inventory items from other characters. The fact that you don't know what these characters look like or where to find them initially means you'll have to waste your time wandering in circles for no reason at all. You can also talk--using the term very loosely--to just about any Fremen, yet most of them will offer inane or even incoherent non sequiturs. Some of the characters' statements are so bizarre that they at least provide unintentional comedic relief. Characters will also mention events not shown or properly explained in the game. If you haven't read the novel, you'll likely have no clue what's being referred to part of the time. This all feels like some perverse way of stretching out a short game.   As shown in both its film adaptations, Dune has enormous visual potential, though the game's graphics are merely average, often looking rather dull and dated. On the one hand, you'll see a few nice details like extremely realistic smoke effects, yet other effects, like weapons fire, look very bland. The environments don't adhere to the miniseries and are mostly forgettable both in look and layout, though they feature a few nicely painted textures, particularly the striated desert rocks.   Dune's character designs and animations suffer from a bunch of problems. Characters move extremely stiffly and slowly. Paul runs as if he were utterly exhausted from a week of trudging across the desert, and dead guards casually crumble to the ground in slow motion. Up close, the characters' faces often look downright ugly, and lip-synching animations are poorly done too. You'll also notice right off that the characters bear no resemblance to those in the miniseries. With his black, jagged locks, the Paul of the game looks a lot more like a generic anime character than he does actor Alec Newman from the miniseries.   Like its visuals, Dune's sparse sound effects have little going for them. Weapons, for instance, sound underpowered and tinny. The voice-overs aren't handled by the actors from the miniseries, nor are they handled particularly well at all, for that matter. They're competent at best. For its music, the game wisely sticks with portions of Graeme Revell's evocative, elegiac orchestral score from the miniseries. It's sad that the music should be the high point of the game, though.   Despite a couple of moderately nice touches, Frank Herbert's Dune is a dud of a game. Any strengths are marred by a long string of poor design decisions and equally poor execution. The game utterly fails to capture the majesty and mystery of the Dune universe, turning it into an interactive Saturday morning cartoon--and a bad one at that. Toss this one to the worms. "
1638,JumpJet Rex,5.0,1,"If you were born after the NES was in its heyday, the sparkly throwbacks now being released every couple of weeks might give you the impression that the era was just all killer, no filler for 10 beautiful years. In this dream world, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the only game anyone ever needed, a new Mega Man rained down upon us from the heavens on a regular basis, and Capcom and Konami were revered as gods and their every offering was like delicious, life-sustaining manna. In that regard, JumpJet Rex is a blessing, in that it reminds us that the 8-bit era wasn't all sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows. It was also a lot of screaming, nerve-destroying, controller-chucking aggravation, and none were immune from its sudden onset. Ask anyone who bought the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, expecting a fun, breezy time for the whole family, and watch the thousand-yard stare wash over them like the evening tide. JumpJet Rex brings back that delightful concept of a cutesy setup being used as a vessel for diabolical evil. In it, the dinosaurs were advanced enough to master space travel, sending up a lone, rocket boot-wearing T-rex to go explore the galaxy. While he's up there, mission control finds out that an asteroid--the asteroid--is on its way, and sends Rex to the outer reaches to go destroy it. Oh, and to explore a couple dozen random planetoids along the way.   The planets are perfect tile-based approximations of 8-bit pixels, albeit with huge, widescreen playing fields. The environments, sadly, are limited, recycling the same four space base/ice level/plant world/stone temples throughout. Though the enemies get annoyingly diverse later--more on that soon--the levels lose their luster by the end. They are, undoubtedly, on the appealingly colorful side; the ice levels beautifully depict Hoth-like conditions in which to zoom around, and a lightning effect on the later space stages make them look particularly animated and dangerous. The accompanying chiptune soundtrack doesn't take full advantage of the NES's jerry-rigged range of instrumentation, but it's fun, catchy stuff to putter around the galaxy to. Movement is pleasantly free-flowing. Having rocket boots means that you have an infinite jump, the ability to blast yourself left and right, and lift off vertically, and a tiny blast is given off in your wake that can actually do damage to enemies. Using these abilities, your mission in each stage is to pass through a specified number of gates to open up the finish line, where you earn a star. Like in Super Mario 64, you need a certain number of stars to open up each stage, but you can earn additional stars per stage by getting through without dying and by beating the stage time record. Sounds easy. It is decidedly not. Early stages are a delight, with Rex blasting through coins, squeezing through tight corridors, and making split-second maneuvers to dodge lasers or avoid the walls. You're dead in one hit, so that old tension is here, keeping your reflexes sharp; It's challenging, but fun all the same. After the first boss, however, the difficulty spikes hard and fast. The game gets projectile-happy in a hurry, where tracking lasers and fire-spewing plants line every surface or are set up just past the outer limits of the screen where you can't see them, seemingly just begging you to try using your rockets. Tight squeezes are now less a matter of having a few tiles to move around but a scant few pixels. Boss fights aren't necessarily hard but tedious, with every hit doing minor chip damage at best. Around halfway through, the game ceases to be fun. It becomes a chore. Difficulty isn't a negative in and of itself, but its merits can be measured in a simple question: “Is it my fault I'm dying?” “Is there a flaw in my own skills that could prevent this?” Increasingly, the game sits on the bad side of that question, where obstacles are surmountable seemingly by sheer luck more than skill. The game puts import on being able to nab more than one star from a stage to advance, but the time trial records are ludicrous, and dying becomes more and more a certainty; it is a recipe for seething hate. Your rewards for success often come down to little more than the money you've collected, which can be traded for insanely overpriced cosmetic items. In one of the stores you open early on, every item costs $100,000 coins. By the time I reached the final boss, I had $78,000. Troublesome economy aside, technical hitches are common, even on fairly straightforward stages and bosses, with the frame rate tanking and button presses ceasing to register when things get too busy. Just like the most aggravating NES games, it's frustrating because there's fun to be had, and had often, in JumpJet Rex. It feels great to play, the aerial trickery is gratifying, and it's got a lot of goofy charm, but all of this is unfortunately buried under an inexplicable need to test players beyond what should be necessary in a galaxy where you tool around as a T-rex wearing sunglasses."
1884,Velocity 2X,9.0,2,"Velocity 2X is interactive poetry. All of its pieces, all of its movements, all of its systems and mechanics flow seamlessly into and out of one another to create a constant tone of movement and a feeling of endless flow. A mistimed jump, a poorly placed shot, and even death are merely delays; brief hurdles in your pursuit of a perfect run. Velocity's influences are clear from the outset--Metroid, Mario, and countless classic shoot-em-ups. Molding such disparate genres together isn't easy, but Velocity manages to create a tight, focused experience with a stunning level of finesse. At any given point you could be at the helm of a blazing-fast ship equipped with the ability to teleport anywhere, or you could be running around as a not-so-subtle reference to Metroid's Samus Aran--arm cannon and all. Velocity 2X opens with the capture of protagonist, Kai. Shortly thereafter, she undergoes numerous cybernetic experiments, giving her an extraordinary set of abilities. Even without a complex or gritty narrative, Kai's arc as a protagonist is still sympathetic. She regularly flashes between aggressive, sassy, humorous, and even nostalgic. Phenomenal artwork that is crisp and prismatic helps reinforce that broad emotional spectrum. Cel-shading mixed with some clever lighting gives Kai and the world she inhabits a palpable sense of weight and presence. Velocity 2X pulls heavily from its 2D inspirations, but adds distinct visual layers that give the environments depth. That flair effectively communicates both the emotional context for any given scene and helps highlight obstacles to you so that you can keep up your momentum without having to pick through convolution.   Velocity offer more than impressive visuals, though. The early stages introduce each gameplay type separately so that you can familiarize yourself with how each works. Later, once you've mastered them, it blends all of these ideas together while doling out unique twists. That's critical, too, because the game is layered and nuanced to such a degree that it takes an entire campaign to move from “comfortable” to “fluent” with all of its mechanics. Velocity 2X uses a novel approach by using the entire game as a tutorial and subsequent runs as the challenge. That only works because there's a steady progression that runs throughout. Each stage feels like an incremental step up in difficulty that loops back around to the beginning areas. Perfectly finishing an early level is substantially harder than merely completing one of the later ones, and that helps you feel like you're still growing and learning the second time. The unfortunate side effect of that approach is that the finale lacks the appropriate thematic climax. Tension is constantly ratcheted higher and higher, but there's no release at the end--just another loop. It's a small issue, but it's also the only thing holding Velocity 2X from utter perfection. The first few areas teach basic ship movement. From there, Velocity 2X folds in its brand of teleportation, which is a lightning fast flick-based affair. It's a novel way to move throughout your environment. Walls fall away and your path through any given level takes on another dimension. It does take some getting used to, however. Initially I felt like I was haphazardly bouncing around. The harsh sound of a warp and the smooth animation make these micro-jumps consistently satisfying, but I didn't realize how beautiful that could be until my second round. Starting a jump requires careful aiming, and when you're racing through a new section it's easy to mess that up and accidentally kill yourself. That doesn't matter though, because death is never a big deal. You respawn quickly, losing little more than a second or two most of the time. On the second, third, or fourth time through, you'll have become familiar enough with the area to plan and calculate warps rapidly that are safe but imprecise. That's supported by a forgiving aiming system that favors snaps of the joystick over meticulous targeting. Latter levels will have you play as Kai on foot, where there are even more environmental dangers. To compensate, teleportation works only at set distances for each of the four cardinal directions, and keeps the action-platforming from becoming unnecessarily lethal. When combined with the dashes and jumps introduced later, movement in Velocity 2X becomes an elegant system for expression. Dashing, shooting, jumping, and more help flesh out the later stages.   After the pieces have been introduced and tested in controlled environments, Velocity 2X starts combining them in increasingly complex sequences with longer, sometimes labyrinthine challenges. Telepods allow you to set up long range warp points, and they facilitate puzzles that have you completing some parts before flashing back to the beginning to take an alternate route. It's a brilliant system that creates controlled bursts of backtracking without the monotony that often follows. In one level, literally called “The Labyrinth,” you'll have to set up these points across the map and warp back repeatedly as you unlock new zones. It sounds slow and tedious, but teleportation is integrated so smoothly and completely that it always feels perfect, maintaining that core focus on speed and momentum.   That constant pressure to move forward and be faster creates micro risk/reward moments. You can't dash while also using your main arm cannon when on foot. You still have access to a larger rifle that can only fire left or right. That mechanic forces you to sacrifice speed for protection or vice versa, and encourages you to put yourself in danger to move just a bit faster. Similarly, while in the ship, your boost pushes the whole map upwards. Holding that speed can catch you on ledges, killing you as the screen continues to scroll. The trade-off provides depth and enough emergent variety to keep every run on nearly every level fresh. Each of Velocity 2X's ingredients are basic in themselves. Shooting down enemy ships isn't interesting on its own, but when combined with an exceptional system for movement and tied to an omnipresent clock, it feels truly special.   A mistimed jump, a poorly placed shot, and even death is merely a delay; a brief hurdle in your pursuit of a perfect run. You feel the running theme of momentum constantly. Velocity builds its play to feel uninterrupted. Death isn't a mark of failure. Shifting between story and play isn't marked by a shift in background music. Fractions of a second separate ship combat and platforming. Sleek animations and consistent frame rates graphically sell the motif. Players can shift seamlessly between the PS4 and the Vita, and Velocity 2X is just as gorgeous and just as fluid on both. There's never a dropped beat, never a moment where you aren't moving, and you can always be faster.  "
891,The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit,8.0,2,"The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a short Life is Strange episode set before the upcoming Life Is Strange 2, and it doesn't cost a cent to download and play. A cynic might call it a simple act of marketing, a demo to whet our appetites. But Captain Spirit feels like much more than that, despite sticking to a single location and ending pretty quickly. It's more like the Ground Zeroes to Life is Strange 2's The Phantom Pain: it hints towards what the next series might be like, with a nice visual upgrade and a few new mechanics, but it also feels whole as it is. From the moment Sufjan Stevens' haunting, gorgeous track ""Death with Dignity"" kicked in over the opening montage, I was hooked on The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit. It is a beautiful game.Captain Spirit is the playful superhero alter-ego of Chris Eriksen, a young boy with a love of comics, an untarnished sense of childlike wonder, and a bubbling inner turmoil and grief that rarely cracks the surface. Chris lives alone with his dad, Charles, a former basketball star whose life has been on a downward trajectory for years. The pair live alone in a drab, cheaply built house on the outskirts of Beaver Creek. Chris' mother died some time ago, and without getting into the specifics, there are parallels to Chloe's situation in the original Life is Strange. It's odd to see Captain Spirit dipping so explicitly into that same emotional well, because otherwise, it is very much its own thing, despite a few interesting links to the original game for eagle-eyed players to find and speculate on.The game--which runs for maybe three hours if you're a completionist, but can be sped through much faster--takes place across a single Saturday morning. It opens, charmingly, with Chris doodling a superhero costume, giddy at the prospect of having a full day to play. It's up to you how you want to spend that Saturday. Most of the objectives in the game are strictly optional, and you can ""finish"" the game having completed very few of them, but Chris' stated desire is to go on various adventures as Captain Spirit. These range from the mundane to the fantastical--Captain Spirit needs to throw snowballs at beer bottles to improve his aim and play with all his toys to ""check in"" on them, but he also needs to assemble the parts of his costume to go on bigger adventures, like defeating the Snowmonger (an evil-looking snowman), and the water-hoarding ""monster"" in his home (a malfunctioning water heater). There's a whole mythology to Chris' games and fantasies, and they're a delight to dig into.Mechanically, completing these objectives boils down to standard adventure game puzzling. You travel around the interior and yard of the Eriksen house, building up your inventory and figuring out how to solve numerous puzzles. In fact, Captain Spirit is far more of a classical adventure game than many titles in the genre have been since Telltale's The Walking Dead, and it's all the better for it. The puzzles, while rarely challenging, have a nice sense of logic and order to them that make them satisfying.Chris is a great character, too. He's a believably childlike 10-year-old, which is rare not just in games, but in any media. He's dealing with a difficult life as best he can, and succeeds as a sympathetic figure. He also has a powerful imagination, which sometimes sends him off into fantasy sequences as he does battle with Captain Spirit's ""enemies."" These are cutscenes rather than playable sections, but they're visually inventive and fun nevertheless, working as metaphors for Chris' grief and fears, and they give some insight into how the boy's mind works. The game is also beautifully coy about whether Chris has any sort of power akin to Max's ability to rewind time in the first game. The line is cleverly blurred, as Chris is often shown performing what looks to be telekinesis only for a pullback to reveal that it was something much more mundane--a remote control nestled in his concealed hand when he turns the TV on with his ""mind,"" to give one example. But there's a strong hint that there's more to it than what we see. Charmingly, these moments--and the fantasy sequences--are labeled as ""hero"" choices, which can be triggered when Chris wants to do something befitting of a hero.Between these moments of imagined bravado, you'll be pulled right back to earth when you're hunting through boxes and finding letters and drawings by Chris' mother, or finding things his dad didn't want him to see. Captain Spirit is surprisingly moving, and the aforementioned Sufjan Stevens track is used a few times to devastating effect. I ended up playing through Captain Spirit three times to test out all the different dialog options, and while I couldn't affect truly significant change--the ending was the same each time--picking away at the game and finding everything hidden in it was a satisfying experience.While Chris enjoys his morning, his dad sits on the couch watching basketball and drinking, occasionally giving compliments or barking orders as his mood--and his level of sobriety--shifts. Without, again, spoiling the specifics, Charles is a fundamentally bad dad, a heavy drinker with a violent streak that, one can surmise, is getting worse over time. We see him through his son's eyes, though, and the naivety of Chris--who only sees the efforts of his father and is too young to fully comprehend how bad things have gotten--is heartbreaking. At a few points in the game, you can discover nice things Charles has planned for his son, and Chris is very vocal about how much he loves his father.The first Life is Strange often went quite broad with characters, especially when you first met them, but there was an underlying complexity to them. This is even truer here and the important thing with Charles, at least in this short episode, is that he's a more complex figure than an outright monster--however, it never feels like the writers are excusing how awful he's being. This is a hard line to walk, but the game successfully condemns the man in a realistic way, acknowledging that abusers with some humanity are still, at their core, abusers. The script is tight too, with dialog that is free of dated terms or incongruities. A few exchanges start to sound stilted once you've played through multiple times and have a sense of how all the pieces fit together, but that's perhaps unavoidable.Life is Strange gained a huge cult following, and whether you're a veteran or a newcomer, Captain Spirit captures a lot of the original game's appeal. Regardless of how you classify The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit--whether it's a standalone adventure, a demo, or a prologue--it's a beautiful game, and one that leaves you all the more excited about Life is Strange 2."
4928,Undercover AD2025 Kei,2.0,0,"Undercover AD2025 Kei is an action-adventure game developed by Pulse Interactive. The developers had some talented minds among them - Arimasa Osawa, a popular novel writer in Japan, and Takashi Yoneda, who previously worked on Wonder Project J for the N64. The game looked pretty promising early on, but now that the game is on shelves, it's a complete and utter disappointment. You take on the roles of Kei, her partner Lim, and a cat. The story begins when a murder occurs in a hotel. Your team is called to investigate the crime scene, leading you into a story shrouded with mystery, which delves into Kei's secret past - a past that Kei herself has no recollection of. The storyline is good and stands as one of the game's few strengths, but the gameplay manages to waste Osawa's well-written plot. Still pictures of the game make it look fairly decent. But set those images in motion, and the low quality is immediately noticeable. The collision detection in the game is horrible, and the frame rate varies from a smooth 60 frames per second down to an extremely choppy 15 frames per second in certain areas. The characters' motions - whether walking, swinging a club, shooting a gun, or getting hit - are very limited, giving the game an even choppier look. The game's only nice visuals are in the CG cutscenes. Adding more to the frustration factor is the game's abysmal control. Using the analog stick or the normal D-pad, the response time is slow, and the controls are too tight, which almost defeats the purpose of having analog control in the first place. In fact, you can move faster if you crouch and keep rolling instead of simply running. You can switch between third-person and first-person perspective, but it sometimes helps to play the game in first-person perspective, as the camera angle in the third-person perspective is awful. When attacking, you use the R trigger on the controller. When you're holding a gun, pressing the trigger halfway will not shoot the gun; instead, it is used to taunt enemies and maybe trick them into dropping their weapons. Supposedly this is used for stealth, so you can sneak behind the enemies' backs. That would have been great if it had worked, but enemies activate when you enter their view range - which extends to behind their backs. So you are better off pressing the R trigger all the way in, which shoots your gun. There is no aiming involved; instead, a big dot appears on top of the enemy you're shooting. More damage is induced at closer ranges. When you are ambushed by enemies with guns, the instruction manual says to crouch so the enemies will take a few seconds to fix their aim. Most of the time you will simply crouch and then keep rolling forward until you are close enough to your enemies to shoot them.  The music in the game is passable, but the sound effects are atrociously poor. Every sound - from a gunshot to enemy grunting - is like something out of a bad Super Nintendo game. When the main character gets killed, she screams the name of her pet cat, but it actually sounds more like loud shrieking than anything else.  Undercover falls far below average as a game title and stands out as one of the worst games we've come across in recent months. Stay far, far away from this game."
3052,Shadows of the Damned,8.0,2,"  Honestly, even if you forget about the demons constantly trying to kill you, hell is a pretty lousy place. Take, for instance, an ordinary act like turning on the lights. While residing on the earthly plane, you just flick a switch and your world is bathed in a fluorescent glow. But if you're stuck in hell, you have to find a goat head (listen for the bleats!) and shoot it with your flaming pistol. You do have a flaming pistol, right? There's a chance it's called a Boner. That's what Garcia Hotspur calls his gun. Make no mistake about it, Shadows of the Damned is a weird game, but it doesn't use its strangeness as a crutch to hold up sagging gameplay. There's a chance you may become immune to the reggae charm of the sushi lamp or just find vulgar jokes off-putting. But the beauty of the brilliantly crafted combat situations makes it so that you can't help but push on to see what devious traps lay before you. Shadows of the Damned turns the gloomy world of hell into a digital paradise.            Flawed core mechanics have been known to derail lesser games, but there's no such problem in Shadows of the Damned. Garcia enters hell prepared to execute every demon in sight, and he has the firepower to pull off such a feat. Endearing names like Skullblaster, Hotboner, and Dentist are affixed to guns comparable to a shotgun, pistol, and machine gun, but they are a lot more versatile than their real-life counterparts. Upgrades let you increase carrying capacity, damage, and reload speed, but these tools of destruction let you go much further. At specific story moments, new powers are unlocked that make the already-delicious combat even more enticing. Your ordinary pistol gains the ability to shoot combustible mines that are just as handy for knocking down cracked walls as they are at blowing a wicked demon sky high. With a blast from your shotgun, you can blow off an arm or leg or initiate an instant-death decapitation, but why waste your time aiming? Homing bullets let you dispose of demons with lazy ease. Weapons are diverse and deadly in Damned, and it's sadistically satisfying to strike down your teeming enemies with them.     Combat is a lot more involved than just shooting any fool who wanders your way. Darkness is the creeping threat that lingers around you, and if you get caught in the gloomy veil, your health slowly depletes. To lift this fog, you must seek out a goat head positioned somewhere on a wall. It's a basic concept that is used in fascinating ways during the course of your heroic rescue mission. You may need to run through a hall of shadows, cognizant of your slowly draining health, to reach safety on the other side. Or a monster may confront you that fears the darkness above all else, and you have to figure out a way to quench flames without succumbing to death yourself. Puzzles force you to step in a darkened room to find the solution, and certain bosses require you to make the same sacrifice. How can you so readily kill if you're afraid to dance with death when the time arises? There's a constant balance to tempt fate without dying that makes these scenarios intoxicating.         Shadows of the Damned explores different types of gameplay to keep things fresh, but the best diversions are the boss fights. Every one of these terrible beasts is incredible in some way. In the first battle, you find yourself in a market confronted by a crazed man with a harmonica and a machete. Garcia is a big man, but he looks like a skinny runt compared to this undead freak. Your normal shots are ineffective, so you're left turning away from this growing threat and running as fast as you can. The market is a maze of overturned tables, evacuated stalls, and barren aisles as far as you can see. The breath of the mad man is in your ear, so you run, hurdle tables, and run some more as you look for safety of any kind. You round a corner, strain your ears, and only hear the dulcet tones of silence. Have you lost him? Are you free? You stand still for a moment, straining every sense to figure out where he has gone. And then, with a crash, he bursts through the wall beside you and the chase is on again. The madman can die, as you find out through experimentation, but your heart will race before you slay him. Every fight forces you to use your brains along with your fingers, and these fights make up some of the most amazing moments in the entire game.      All of the incredible moments in Shadows of the Damned are intensified by the excellent sound design. The score is an absolute masterpiece. Every track does a fantastic job of setting the mood, and the sheer wealth of different styles is staggering. One persistent character serenades you with an operatic aria that even Garcia remarks upon its catchiness. During other moments, you may be treated to a guitar-heavy rock song or a quiet piano medley. The music is good enough to listen to on its own, but in the context of the game, it heightens your senses even further. What's just as impressive is how well the sound effects are implemented. You're in hell and you feel like you're trapped there. Sound walls you in during fights, crawling up your spine and smacking you in the face. You can't escape. A demon growls in the distance. Is it nearby? Is it hunting you? The rattle of your machine gun echoes off the walls while a goat cries overhead. You can hear the darkness closing in on you. It has swallowed you whole--a soft siren counting the beats until your death. It gets in your head and pounds on your eardrums as it screams and berates you. Where is that crying baby? Shut it up! Cram a strawberry in its mouth! The story is partly told through the music and effects, and it's amazing how much this adds to the adventure.        Shadows of the Damned takes 10 or so hours your first time through, and not one second of that time is wasted on boring activities. This is a tightly crafted adventure with a relentless sense of pace that continually pushes you forward. Every boss fight and diversion serves to enhance the experience, and the combat sequences are so beautifully realized that they continually surprise and entertain. When the ending credits roll, you'll just want to plow through the game all over again, but that's where one of the few problems surface. There's no New Game+ option, so you don't have the chance to take your upgraded guns with you from the beginning. It's a big disappointment because there's really no incentive to play through again, other than getting to take this crazy trip one more time. But you won't have to worry about that your first time through Shadows of the Damned's amazing journey into the bowels of hell.    "
3702,WCW Backstage Assault,5.0,1,"When Electronic Arts took control of the World Championship Wrestling license, everyone expected big things. The wrestling market was truly blowing up at the time, and EA was poised to capitalize on this explosion. WCW Mayhem, the company's first WCW-licensed game, took a more arcade-style approach to wrestling that generated a lot of mixed feelings. Now, EA has released its second WCW game, which uses the same gameplay engine but takes a radically different approach to wrestling. WCW Backstage Assault doesn't feature any rings. All of the gameplay takes place in backstage areas, such as parking lots, locker rooms, and loading bays.   WCW Backstage Assault has a pretty comprehensive roster. All the major players - from Jeff Jarrett to Booker T - are included, and the roster even includes a few faces that haven't been seen around WCW lately, such as Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan. At the start of the game, there aren't too many wrestlers available, but they're easily unlocked by playing through the game's most interesting mode, the hardcore challenge. The hard-core challenge works a lot like the Madden challenge that EA has been putting into its NFL football games for the past couple of years. Each level has a few different objectives, such as knocking out your opponent with a particular item, setting your opponent on fire, or simply using a certain object in the level to dish out some damage. Each completed challenge results in some sort of bonus, usually in the form of unlocking a new wrestler or a new move for use in the create-a-wrestler portion of the game. The other modes are pretty standard, including an exhibition mode and a survival mode. The create-a-wrestler mode has returned with new pieces to use in your quest to create the ultimate wrestler, but it's largely the same as Mayhem's.   Backstage Assault has a very choppy look to it. The textures are all extremely muddy and pixilated. The models look extremely odd, especially with their overly skinny legs and feet. The animation for the moves is decent, but the game lacks any sort of transitions between moves, so the wrestlers end up looking extremely choppy. The gameplay, which is mostly identical to that of WCW Mayhem, is pretty simple to pick up. You have three different strike buttons and a grapple button. After grappling, hitting a direction and one of the strike buttons results in a move. You can also run, block, counter attacks, and climb up onto various objects for aerial attacks. Countering was fairly difficult in Mayhem, but in Backstage Assault it has been reduced to a single button press, making it more of a timing issue than a guessing game.   Given the sad state of commentary in today's wrestling games, it's good to hear a game that actually has some decent commentary. The two-man team of Tony Schivonne and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan remain on top of the action, though the move call-outs occasionally fall behind the action. Also, much of the voice work from Mayhem has been reused in Backstage Assault. The sound of the action, such as wrestlers bouncing off of trash cans, walls, and kitchen sinks, is pretty good.   Overall, it's hard to recommend a wrestling game that doesn't contain any actual in-the-ring wrestling. EA's Backstage Assault is a novel idea, but in the end, it doesn't have enough variation to make it worthwhile. This one is only for the hard-core WCW fan."
2178,How to Survive,7.0,2,"Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead. Much like its inspirations, How to Survive is a mishmash of tried-and-tested ideas. It's a peppering of gripping challenges and mechanics that come together into a cohesive whole that elevates the otherwise milquetoast experience to a level that satisfies an itch you may not even know you had. You can play as one of three young, able-bodied people, lost within a small archipelago packed with way more zombies than there are people in New York. Your goal, of course, is survival against all odds. You need to craft items, and manage hunger, thirst, and exhaustion, all while fending off the limitless hordes of bloody, brain-eating monsters hell-bent on your death. The crux of the experience becomes a careful balance of a dozen or so disparate mechanics, none of which are particularly complex but that total something genuinely interesting. For the first hour or two of the story mode, you're steadily introduced one by one to the core mechanics: combat, crafting new items, gaining experience, leveling up, and all of the other basics of survival. These strategies are communicated to you by way of cheeky tutorials left behind by a mysterious man named Kovac. He tells you, for example, that if you don't eat, you'll rapidly lose strength and be unable to fight well, dramatically reducing your ability to stay alive. He qualifies that with unique rules that elaborately build up that core idea. If you're hungry, you can kill animals for meat, which will rapidly fill you up. However, all meat must be cooked because the animals of the islands contain deadly parasites. Fresh meat also attracts zombies and places you at additional risk until you can pop it on a fire. It's a balancing act in which satisfying one need can place you at greater risk of death. Much of the combat isn't too interesting, but it doesn't need to be--there are plenty of ways for the island to kill you, and you need to stave them all off at once. It's an interrelated network of play that establishes and maintains tension throughout. Finding safe houses or triggering alarms that attract several dozen souped-up zombies who then stand between me and sleep are some of the most invigorating moments I've had with a game in recent memory. Left 4 Dead can be used against their cohorts. Strategically funneling such zombies into a crowd and sprinting by or shooting them causes massive damage to everyone around. As all of these mundane pieces fall in line, however, the game rapidly reaches its conclusion. The setup for all this does take time, however. Incendiary and explosive devices, two classic anti-zombie weapons, don't become available until the late game, and their utility at that stage is minimal at best. After such an extensive tutorial, the end comes right when tension should be at its highest, and ultimately the game feels like it's missing another few hours of play. There are challenge modes to help extend the experience a bit, each of which involves starting with an empty inventory and trying to reach an escape plane before you die. They're definitely fun tests, but none of them add up to what the game needs to appropriately demonstrate its strengths: an extra-long story, or a trial to see how long you can survive as each passing day grows exponentially more difficult. Either of these would amount to more time to play around with the full sandbox potential of the game. Despite the lack of a mode that facilitates experimentation, in my first run I found plenty of excellent moments that kept me thirsting for more. While the game map is static, the appearance of most of the zombies is random, and there were more than a few instances when a routine trip down a known route quickly got me screaming out of absolute terror, particularly in the late game, when even the wildlife joins the ranks of the undead. Piranhas can take turn a careless wanderer into a mess of flesh and bone faster than you can drop an F-bomb. Zombies are also susceptible to these dangers. At one point, I was surrounded by a good three dozen or so brain-hungry monsters and desperate for some way to take them all out. I was running and gunning through a swamp and noticed several go down in a matter of seconds; thanks to a swarm of hungry piranhas, I survived. Later, I was out of healing items and low on ammo. Lost in a new section of the island at night, I managed to wipe out zombified humans by tricking an undead deer into goring them on my behalf. After dispatching the last foe, I set up camp on a cliff and waited out the night until I could safely risk the rest of the journey to a safe haven. On higher difficulty, the spirit of survival horror finds a home in an unlikely wrapper. Finding safe houses or triggering alarms that attract several dozen souped-up zombies who then stand between me and sleep are some of the most invigorating moments I've had with a game in recent memory. These examples aren't common enough, however, and with the largely random nature of the game, you may not have exciting moments like these at all. While it may be tinged with an insubstantial campaign and a few other minor problems, How to Survive is a worthy game built on a strong foundation of exciting experiences."
4537,Necromania: Traps of Darkness,4.0,0,"  At first glance, Necromania: Traps of Darkness appears to be yet another 2D, dungeon-crawling Diablo clone, with click-to-attack gameplay and an isometric, overhead viewpoint. Unfortunately, it's actually a lot worse than that description. Necromania is more of a strategic puzzle game than it is an action role-playing game. There's usually nothing wrong with that, but in this case, the game's poorly implemented design, clunky interface, Stone Age graphics, and horrible sound effects combine to form a product that is impossible to recommend to anyone.        In the game, you take the role of one of seven different servants of Ragnar, an evil god who has been locked up by the good guys. You and the six other servants have broken out of your own prison, and you must compete with one another to be the first to free your master. The seven servants consist of different character classes, ranging from an orc sleuth, to a magician, a knight, and a skeleton warrior. Each class has varying speed and strength, a melee attack, a special skill (the magician turns invisible, while the fog woman can turn into invincible fog, for instance), and the ability to lay traps.      The playing area in Necromania is broken up into 20 small levels, spanning four different settings, including a prison, a forest, caves, and a mountainous region. Some of the levels have multiple floors, but your goal in all of them is the same: Gather up enough keys to open all the locked doors, and find the three pieces of the skeleton key that will let you access the exit portal to the level for victory. Standing in your way are other artificial intelligent-controlled servants that are also searching boxes and barrels in the level for the keys, as well as tons of Indiana Jones-inspired environmental hazards like flame jets and blade-trapped doorways. The idea behind each level is that you must find the keys before your opponents do, or defeat them in battle and take away the keys they've found, so you can find your way out. You can set traps in devious ways to kill your opponents, such as placing a teleporter in a busy hallway that will warp an enemy into the middle of a trapped door. Power-ups are also scattered around the level, and they can increase your fighting ability.     On paper, the premise of Necromania sounds alright; but in practice, the game is more frustrating than it is fun. Chief among the frustrations is that it's difficult to tell if a key or a piece of a key that you need is still hidden in some box on the level, or if it's being carried by one of your opponents. When you finally get to that last locked door, and you realize you need to take another walk around the level and check every single barrel and box, as well as kill your enemies who are searching for that last key, you'll struggle to keep from pulling out your hair (especially when you find yourself on the opposite side of the level looking for the key and you see one of your enemies escape through the portal, which results in a loss for you). And speaking of keys, the developers of Necromania force you to press a button on the keyboard in order to open a locked door. When you're running from an enemy while dodging flame jets and poisonous spiders, fumbling for that button on the keyboard to open the door doesn't make much sense, considering every other game lets you simply click on a locked door to open it when you possess the correct key.         On a more fundamental level, the combat in Necromania just isn't that fun. Sure, it can be satisfying to set up a clever trap that sucks your enemies into a death pit. But the cost of setting devious traps (wasting time that could be spent looking for keys) just isn't commensurate with the reward (which is the small possibility that the defeated enemy might drop something useful). It's much more efficient to just fight enemies that you run into, although the combat in the game is dull and simply not fun. If you have a character who's stronger than the opponent, you can just stand and mash on the melee button until the enemy dies. If you're faster, you engage briefly, and then try to get your opponent to chase you as you drop traps in your wake. That's about it.     Necromania possesses a weak role-playing element where you earn points after completing each level that you can use to upgrade your strength or speed. But since you only get one or two points on each level, adding these to your existing stats only improves you by a fractional amount, ultimately making the stat boosts useless.      You won't find any salvation in Necromania's presentation, either. The game can only be played in 800x600 or 1024x768 resolutions, resulting in a primitive, pixelated look for environments and characters. The levels don't offer much variety either, and the characters animate rather poorly. The game's CG cutscenes look farcical, and almost campy in execution, as though you're watching an Evil Dead flick. It's possible that the look on the cutscenes was intentional. But the game's sound effects are sparse and the speech is laughably bad. Necromania's speech literally sounds as if the placeholder voices used during development were just never removed. Necromania also includes LAN and Internet play for up to seven players, but you won't have any luck finding people online to play against. LAN play, meanwhile, is about as bad as the single-player campaign.     Overall, Necromania: Traps of Darkness comes off as a hastily slapped together mess that may have originally been intended as a Diablo clone, but was changed at the last moment to be more of a strategic puzzler. Poor design, frustrating gameplay, and downright terrible production values make Necromania a train wreck of a game that you'd do well to avoid entirely.  "
1835,Grand Theft Auto IV,10.0,2,"      Grand Theft Auto IV's story mode can be beaten in less than 30 hours, and there are so many optional activities and side missions to take part in along the way that you can comfortably double that number if you're in no hurry. The majority of the story missions task you with making deliveries and/or killing people, and play out in much the same way as those in previous games. With that said, most of the missions are a lot easier this time around, partly because Niko is a more agile and efficient killer than any of his predecessors, and partly because the LCPD seemingly has better things to do than hunt down an illegal immigrant who's gunning down undesirables all over the city. Some of the more imaginative missions sprinkled throughout the story include a kidnapping, a bank heist, and a job interview. The cinematic cutscenes associated with story missions are superbly presented and are the sequences in which the game's characters really shine. Without exception, the characters you encounter benefit from great animation, great voice work, and superbly expressive faces. They're not always so impressive when they join you on a mission and refuse to do what they're supposed to (for example, not following you on an escort mission, or failing to negotiate a doorway). Nevertheless, these problems are few and far between, and they're made less painful by the new ""replay mission"" option that you're presented with whenever you fail.       Given the amount of trouble that you get into as you play through the story mode, it's inevitable that the police are going to get involved from time to time, even when their presence isn't a scripted feature of your mission. Liberty City's boys in blue are quick to respond when you get flagged with a wanted level of between one and six stars, but they're not nearly as tough to deal with as their counterparts in previous GTA games. They don't drive as quickly when pursuing you, they rarely bother to set up roadblocks, and you'll need to blow up practically an entire city block before the FIB (that's not a typo) show up. Furthermore, you're given an unfair advantage in the form of your GPS system; when you're not using it to plot a valid route to any waypoint of your choosing, it doubles as a kind of police scanner. Any time you have a brush with the law, the GPS shows you the exact locations of patrol cars and cops on foot in your area, and highlights the circular area (centered on your last known whereabouts) where they're concentrating their search. To escape, all you need to do is move outside the circle and then avoid being seen for 10 seconds or so, which is often best achieved by finding a safe spot and just sitting there. It's not a bad system in theory, but in practice it makes dodging the law a little too easy, especially when your wanted level is low and the search area is small.      When you're not running missions for criminals, taking part in street races, stealing cars to order, or randomly causing trouble, you'll find that there are plenty of opportunities to unwind in Liberty City. Some of these optional activities offer tangible rewards that can prove useful in missions later on, whereas others are just a fun way to kill time and take in more of GTAIV's superb humor. For example, you can watch television, listen to numerous different radio stations, check out some genuinely funny shows (including some big-name acts) at cabaret and comedy clubs, and use a computer to surf the in-game Internet.           You'll keep in touch with your dates, friends, and some of your enemies using another of GTAIV's great new features: a cell phone. It's hard to believe that something as simple as a cell phone could add so much to a game like this, but it's implemented so well that it's hard to imagine leaving any of Niko's safe houses without it. If you've ever used a cell phone in real life, you'll have no problem operating this one and, given that it's controlled using only the D pad and a single button, it's easy to call up acquaintances and take calls even while driving. There's no unwieldy conversation system to deal with; you simply choose which friend you want to call, what you want to talk about (it could be work, a fun activity, or asking for a favor) and then, assuming that he or she answers the phone, the conversation plays out. Incoming calls are even easier, though they occasionally come at inopportune (or amusing) times; hearing your cell-phone's signal interfere with your car radio is the least of your worries when you consider the possibility of a date calling you while you're with a prostitute or embroiled in a gunfight with the Mafia. Incidentally, new ringtones and visual themes for your phone can be purchased via the in-game Internet, which is typical of the incredible attention to detail that you'll come to take for granted as you play.     To give you some idea of just how much thought has clearly gone into the crafting of GTAIV, even the act of stealing a parked car, which is still achieved by pushing a single button, can now result in any number of different things happening. If the door is locked, as is often the case, Niko will smash a window with his elbow or his foot to get inside. Once inside the car, he may need to hot-wire it to get it started; you can speed up the process slightly by using the shoulder buttons on your controller. If the car has an alarm, it'll sound for several seconds and cause the headlights to flash on and off as you drive away--practically begging any nearby cops to come after you. Stealing cars with drivers and/or passengers inside opens up lots more possibilities, the most amusing of which is someone (possibly you) getting an arm caught in a door and dragged along as the vehicle speeds away.     Most of the vehicles in GTAIV, like those in previous games, have very loose handling that makes it easy for you to perform Hollywood-style U-turns, skids around corners, and the like. You can play through most of the missions without ever violating a traffic law if you really want to, but you can get away with (and will have a lot more fun) driving like a lunatic, provided that you don't collide with any police vehicles or mow down too many pedestrians. A neat touch when driving with the default camera view is that the camera, which is positioned a few feet behind the rear bumper of the car, centers on you rather than on the vehicle, effectively offering the vehicular equivalent of an over-the-shoulder view. When you take the control of something sporty, the camera also positions itself much closer to the ground, which adds to the sensation of speed.    lot more of the same vehicle on the roads. It's not a big deal, and it isn't detrimental to the gameplay, but it's a little jarring if you get into one of the more unusual vehicles in the game--for example, the equivalent of either a Ferrari or a pickup truck--and suddenly find that the city is filled with them. That particular quirk is pretty common in some of the multiplayer modes as well, though you'll likely be too busy keeping an eye out for other players to take any notice when you venture online.     Getting online in Grand Theft Auto IV couldn't be easier. You simply select the multiplayer option on your cell phone, choose which type of game you want to host or join, and then enter a lobby and wait for the game to start. You won't be getting bored staring at a list of names while you're waiting, though, because when you enter a lobby you actually enter an online version of Liberty City in which you and up to 15 other players are free to do anything. There are weapons scattered all over the place to ensure that things don't stay too friendly for very long.      There are more than a dozen different multiplayer modes to choose from, and although some of them are variations on similar themes, there's certainly no shortage of variety. As the host of a multiplayer session, you also have the freedom to greatly customize all of the game types with variables such as friendly fire, police presence, weapons sets, traffic levels, radar functionality, and many more. You can choose where you'd like your game to take place as well, considering that many gameplay modes can be played either on a specific Liberty City island or across the entire map.      Even conventional 16-player modes such as Deathmatch and Race feel quite different than anything that you've played before. And in addition to those, there are objective-based games in which you're tasked with completing missions similar to those in the single-player game: a team-based Cops 'n Crooks mode, a Turf War mode in which teams compete for control of territories, a carjacking mode, three cooperative missions that support up to four players, and more. With the right group of people, there's no reason why you can't have a lot of fun with every single mode that's available. We experienced a few frame-rate issues and lag that caused other players and their vehicles to jump around the screen at times, but for the most part GTAIV's online play is a real treat. One especially neat touch is that, as a passenger in a vehicle being driven by another player, you can mark waypoints on the GPS system for your driver using a map that tracks the locations of other players and objectives.       If you're wondering about differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Grand Theft Auto IV, the truth is that there aren't many. The PS3 version can only be played after a mandatory install that takes around 10 minutes, and its load times are a little shorter and less frequent as a result. The visuals, which don't always hold up to close scrutiny but are impressive during typical gameplay, are comparable and feature the same quirks (shadows that flicker, for example) on both consoles. Likewise, the audio, which can take a lot of the credit for why Liberty City feels so alive, is exceptional regardless of which console you have and how many speakers it's hooked up to. True to form, GTAIV's soundtrack has plenty of great licensed songs and, unlike other games we could mention, it doesn't force the artist and track information down your throat with pop-up windows that detract from gameplay. However, if you < want that information, you can simply dial up a song-recognition service on your cell phone and, after a few seconds, receive it in a text message. Genius.     In case you haven't guessed already, Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that you simply have to play. The single-player game, which you can still play long after you complete the story, is the series' best by far, and the multiplayer features are good enough that you'll likely have no problem finding people to play with for many months to come. The minor flaws that you'll experience are no more difficult to overlook than those in previous GTA games, and they're greatly outnumbered by the features that will impress and surprise you anytime you think you've already seen everything that the game has to offer. There's lots to see in Liberty City, so you'd best get started.    "
2018,Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft,8.0,2,"World of Warcraft is the everyman's massively multiplayer online game, this is the everyman's collectible card game, and for the most part, Blizzard has justified the fanfare that erupted when it first appeared last March. Warcraft III and WOW's Burning Crusade expansion wraps up the swift campaign, still spouting his convictions that we're unprepared. That may well be true for card gaming tenderfeet, but it rarely matters. One of the great strengths of Hearthstone is that it embraces players who shied from the know-it-alls at Magic: The Gathering events in comic shops or missed the heydays of Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh. What's more, it caters to players burned by the caustic personalities in multiplayer games like League of Legends and Dota 2 by limiting communication with random players to preset responses. (Friends can chat with and battle each other, but to prevent exploits, these matches offer no form of reward or advancement.) In true Blizzard form, Hearthstone shatters barriers to entry while supplying the means to access greater challenges if you seek them. Indeed, card gaming veterans will find much to love beyond the cheesy puns and happy aesthetic. Hearthstone adopts the familiar model of whittling down the opposing player's hit points with attack points from cards, but it simplifies the often cumbersome resource mechanics of other games for a mana bar that automatically expands with the passing of each turn. It's a system geared toward speed, and hero abilities that don't depend on cards--like the mage's fireball--act as wild cards that can keep you in the fight even when surrounded by minions. It's a lunch breaker's game, and indeed, the toughest matches rarely last more than 15 minutes. Blizzard manages to bless Hearthstone with significant depth in spite of such nods to speed. There's a wide assortment of cards with specific abilities in play here, some of which are part of the nine unlockable decks modeled on familiar World of Warcraft classes, and others of which come with the massive bundle of cards that you can use with all the decks. Using the hunter deck, you might spring a trap by unleashing three weak snake cards after an enemy attacks his or her minions; your opponent might fend off the attacks by tossing down a tanky card with ""taunt,"" thereby forcing the snakes to attack the taunting card instead of the main hero. But still further strategies await: your mage could incapacitate the taunting card with a frost nova, thereby letting you have a go at your opponent's hero. All this worked well when beta invites shot out a year ago, but Hearthstone now enjoys a commendable degree of balance in the wake of months of tweaks and player suggestions. It's more apparent in the early levels, when most challengers you meet haven't built powerful decks through their winnings from daily quests and simple leveling, but flashes of it remain at higher levels when players start slapping down legendary cards with alarming frequency. Hearthstone's class decks perform a little of the same service as alts in an online role-playing game; once you get tired of one class, you can jump on another and start leveling it from scratch for a varied experience. Over time, perhaps inevitably, the process of leveling and building killer decks devolves into a grind. Blizzard gives you the option to craft your own cards to counter it, although it's here that the veterans enjoy a significant advantage over card-gaming rookies. Hearthstone simplifies many of the necessary actions, such as destroying excess cards and neatly arranging the available cards in a flipbook of sorts, but the uninitiated get few clues as to what to focus on. In the worst cases, you might waste your material on a worthless card or (the horror) accidentally disintegrate one of the best in your deck. Nevertheless, card crafting is a good way to fill in the gaps for the unlucky. If you can't get a card to appear from the packs you buy through your winnings (or indeed, real-world money), you can usually make it if you have the materials. The best way to break this tedium is to break into the Arena mode. Arenas come with an entry fee, although it's usually negligible if you manage to complete the daily quests, which have you doing things like winning matches with a specific deck or dealing 100 damage to enemy heroes. The allure of Arena lies in the leveling of the playing field. Rather than bringing your own decks into the battle, you're only allowed to choose from one of three classes, and then you need to build your deck by choosing one of the random cards Hearthstone throws at you until you complete a full deck of 30 cards. The outcome can still be outrageously imbalanced. Some schmuck might swim in legendary cards, while the one you have never gets drawn from the deck. Of course, it works both ways. The next Arena match could shower you with legendaries like Ragnaros instead. As is the case with any collectible card game, a degree of randomness affects each action in Hearthstone. It's possible you'll end up with nothing but sorry cards beyond the capable starter decks--I suffered the same fate after I lost my godly deck in a planned wipe halfway through the beta--but there's always the chance of scoring big as well. Still, that randomness might drive players to toss some cash at Blizzard for new card packs (priced at $1.50 each), but the beauty of Hearthstone is that you never feel much if any need to fork out cash. It's a free-to-play game in the best sense of the word, and even the interface for unloading your cash is more stylish than it normally is in such ventures. Hearthstone features no built-in spectator mode, nor does it offer a replay mode, which could have been helpful in learning from your mistakes. Features such as team battles that make Magic's digital duel games so fun make no appearances here, and the daily quests take long enough to complete that you'll sometimes want to spend cash if you want to play in the Arena. But such objections are minor in light of the breezy but brainy experience Blizzard delivers here, particularly for the massive segment of the populace that's never played a collectible card game. If it's dumbed down, then it's in good hands. If any developer's good at weeding out the chaff of more robust games in a particular genre, surely it's Blizzard."
3304,Pac-Man Championship Edition DX,9.0,2,"Pac-Man Championship Edition took the classic Pac-Man formula and reinvigorated it with a new look, changing mazes, a ticking clock and a new emphasis on skillfully eating lots of ghosts in sequence to rack up huge points. But where Championship Edition felt like an evolution of Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition DX feels more like a reinvention. It introduces a number of elements that fundamentally change how Pac-Man is played, without losing any of the timeless appeal of speeding around mazes, gobbling up dots, and chomping ghosts. On the contrary, DX only makes the entire Pac-Man experience more thrilling and addictive than ever.        When Pac-Man made his arcade debut 30 years ago, his life was a game of cat and mouse in which you spent most of your time trying to avoid the ghosts and survive. In DX, survival is not so tricky. What's tricky is scoring as many points as possible within a five- or 10-minute time limit. As in Championship Edition, clearing all the dots from one side of the maze makes a piece of fruit, a cup of coffee, or some other object appear on the other side of the maze. Gobbling up these items changes the cleared portion of the maze and gives you more dots that need to be cleared. What's completely new here is that ghosts are sleeping in set positions throughout these mazes. If you've played Pac-Man before, your instincts may tell you to stay as far away from these ghosts as possible, but that's actually the opposite of what you want to do.      Zooming past a ghost wakes it up, and it immediately starts giving chase to Pac-Man, following every move you make through the maze. As you continue to pass sleeping ghosts, each one will join your ghostly trail. You actually want this to happen, because when you finally gobble up a power pellet, you can turn around and eat your entire ethereal entourage for massive points. Luring dozens of ghosts into following you and then eating all of them at once is immensely satisfying, and this goal completely changes how you approach playing Pac-Man. The challenge is to figure out the most efficient routes through the maze and how to get as many ghosts to follow you as quickly as possible. This new focus makes DX feel a bit like a fast-paced and absorbing puzzle game.     But it also feels like a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants action game that requires lightning-fast reflexes. It's still dangerous out there for Pac-Man, and not all of the ghosts are asleep. His longtime adversaries--Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde--still emerge from the ghost house at the maze's center and roam its passageways, and their movements may sometimes interfere with your best-laid plans. But Pac-Man has a few new tricks up his sleeve that give him an edge over his old foes. As you play, the game's speed gradually increases, which means you can score more points in less time, but it also means that avoiding dangerous situations becomes much more difficult. But when you get extremely close to a ghost, the action slows way down, giving you ample opportunity to react. You want to avoid these situations whenever possible because the clock continues to tick in real time even as the action moves in slow motion, but it's a great addition to the formula that eliminates the potential frustration of dying in situations that spring up too quickly to give you a reasonable chance to respond.        Even with the help of this slow motion, though, you may still find yourself on collision courses with ghosts that offer no chance for escape. That's when your bombs come in handy. You have a limited number of bombs that, when used, bounce all the ghosts on your trail back to the ghost house. Like the slow motion, the option to use a bomb is better than dying, but it comes at a cost. The downside of using one is that it cuts any point multiplier you've built up from eating dots in half, and it prevents you from waking up any additional sleeping ghosts for a short time. (Dying eliminates your multiplier and slows down the game's speed.) Both of these tools are integrated into the action in a way that makes them very useful, without taking the challenge and excitement out of the game.      Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is the very definition of a game that's easy to learn and tough to master, but getting better doesn't feel like an uphill struggle. Gobbling pellets and chomping down ghosts is a great pleasure, thanks to the inherent appeal of the Pac-Man formula and to the very tight and responsive controls. So you find yourself absorbed and wanting to play again and again. And as you do, you naturally start playing smarter and earning higher scores as the patterns become clearer and you get into a groove. The imposed time limit means that, quite literally, every second counts, encouraging you to strive for perfection and avoid mistakes that cost you even a moment. In this endeavor, it's very easy to lose track of the hours as you play, whether you're aiming to knock friends down a peg on the leaderboards or just striving for a new personal best. And getting better and setting new high scores carries with it a feeling of accomplishment that then spurs you on to play still more and continue improving your performance.   Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2 and Pinball FX 2 have integrated friends' leaderboards in ways that fan the flames of competition, the leaderboards in DX are one step removed from the game itself. If you want to see just how you're doing compared to other players, you need to back out of the mode-select menu and enter a separate leaderboard menu where you have to select the specific mode and maze for the scores you want to view. And if you select the filter to view your friends' scores, your own score isn't listed among them. The leaderboards do have one great feature: viewable replays for all of the highest scoring players. If you want to know how the best of the best are getting those amazing scores, you can see how they did it. But it's surprising that a game that's all about high scores makes you go through a few unnecessary steps just to see how your score measures up.        The hottest competition is in the game's first and best mode, called Score Attack (five minutes). But DX offers plenty of opportunities for a change of pace. As you play, you unlock a 10-minute Score Attack mode, as well as a number of time trials that score you not on how many dots and ghosts you eat but on how rapidly you clear the mazes. In addition, you unlock a total of 10 mazes, so you won't soon get bored of retreading the same patterns over and over again. DX also gives you a number of ways to change the look of Pac-Man, with some options carrying on the attractive neonlike appearance of the original Championship Edition, and others that cast Pac-Man and the ghosts as three-dimensional characters in mazes made of building blocks, in a nod to the look of 1987's Pac-Mania. You're also given a number of musical selections, and thankfully, the original CE's excellent ambient track that subtly builds up as time runs out is among them.     Three difficulty levels mean that players of any skill level can start at a speed they're comfortable with, offering a terrific experience to both those driven by a competitive desire to dominate on the leaderboards and those just looking for a fun and accessible game with a retro arcade feel. The new elements fuse so seamlessly with the familiar ones that DX immediately feels like a thrilling new game and a timeless classic at once. Thirty years after Pac-Man first became an arcade sensation, it's exhilarating to see new concepts introduced that make the whole experience of playing completely fresh and compulsively playable all over again. The original arcade superstar is back, and this is one of his best performances yet.  "
4165,KISS: Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child,4.0,0,"When it was released for the PC in late July, KISS: Psycho Circus wasn't well received. Tremor Entertainment has now created a Dreamcast port of the game. Instead of fixing any of Psycho Circus' problems, adding some Dreamcast-only levels, or even just making the game an exact port of the original, the programmers at Tremor have actually removed some key features of the PC version. Maybe in some edgy Todd McFarlane alternate circus universe, that plan would have made KISS a better game. Unfortunately, in ours, it didn't.   The press release that came with the review copy of the game states that it's ""based on the KISS: Psycho Circus comic book series developed by Todd McFarlane, best known as the creator of Spawn."" An interesting thing to note here is that Todd McFarlane is not best known as the creator of KISS: Psycho Circus. That should have been a clue to somebody that the game might be better off if it were more about KISS and less about Todd McFarlane's lame comic book. As it is, KISS: Psycho Circus has lots and lots of Psycho Circus and just an itty-bitty bit of KISS. So even though the band's featured prominently on the packaging, members of the KISS army will be disappointed that their heroes are pretty much absent from the game.   The action can best be described as Gauntlet meets Quake. The game takes place in a fully three-dimensional environment like that in Quake. But instead of fighting a handful of opponents, Psycho Circus tosses a huge number of kamikaze circus creatures at you as you march from one side of the game's dark levels to the other. The levels generally contain a set of Gauntlet-like spawners that must be destroyed to staunch the endless flow of monsters.   At first, the novelty of seeing 20 or 30 creatures onscreen at once is enough to sustain your interest. But that wears off long before the game reaches its halfway point. And the fact that you fight swarms of essentially the same creatures from beginning to end only adds to the repetitive feeling.    The enemies don't display any kind of interesting AI. The headless - simple spider creatures whose heads appear to have been removed less for terrifying effect and more for reducing their polygon count - appear in virtually every fight in the game. They don't look good, and their attack plan is drearily consistent: run straight at you. A few of the other creatures fare a little better, for instance a leering fat lady who rips chunks of blubber from her own body and tosses them at you. But for the most part, Psycho Circus' creatures and the environments they occupy are pretty forgettable.   The sound effects are also weak. Weapons sound less like implements of destruction and more like the tinkling ambient soundscape of a Philip Glass concert. It's very classy but not particularly suited to a video game about blowing things up. The game's most egregious flaw, however, is its utter lack of KISS music. Snippets of the band's songs are played a few times during the game, but for the most part the soundtrack consists of dirge-like techno tracks.   Most of Psycho Circus is steadfastly mediocre. What drives it into the ""bad"" category - and turns it into a product you should avoid on general principle - is the developer's complete lack of effort in adding value to the Dreamcast port. For starters, even though it was originally designed for the PC, no support for the Dreamcast mouse or keyboard has been included. Not a giant omission, perhaps, but certainly not the act of a company that wants to work much for your 40 bucks. The removal of any kind of multiplayer feature is not so easily overlooked, however. The game has neither an online component nor even a split-screen mode. Maybe the developers were too busy with Psycho Circus to check out what was going on with Quake III Arena. Don't you make that same mistake."
43,Exoprimal,7.0,2,"Multiplayer games can live or die based on first impressions, with many games putting their best foot forward by immediately showing off the variety of content they have. Exoprimal takes the opposite approach, only sharing a slice of what it has to offer for the first few hours of gameplay, risking people bouncing off due to a lack of content. It holds back its best moments and more interesting missions for anyone willing to put in the work. Intense and exciting surprises await those who put in the time to reach them--something that it's well worth doing.Exoprimal is a 5v5 shooter, except that the majority of your time will be spent shooting hordes of AI-controlled dinosaurs and not the enemy team. Players race to complete a series of objectives, culminating in a final one that sometimes has PvP elements. Most missions follow this structure, with a few special missions taking place later in the story that deviate from this formula.The gameplay itself is primarily about fighting off hordes of dinosaurs, utilizing your suits specific loadout. The different Exosuits can drastically change the feel of combat, with damage focused suits utilizing a regular machine gun, grenade launcher, or melee weapons. The tank and healer classes each have their own weapons and feel, but with the addition of either a shield ability or healing ability. But the difference between Exosuits, like the counter-focused tank Murasame and the machine gun wielding Krieger tank, is more than enough to make each suit feel fresh in combat. All this brings a nice variety to gameplay, with the shooting itself feeling solid and the different enemies and weak points rewarding accurate shooting.While it's a multiplayer-only game, Exoprimal has a story, but it implants this differently than most, with cutscenes tied to completing matches and special story-based missions appearing at certain milestones. The tone is similar to a low-budget sci-fi movie, with all of the main characters talking and acting like it's an '80s action film, with eye-rolling one-liners and unearned bravado. While the story and dialogue is extremely cheesy, it does mostly work in the context of its ridiculous story. The story is doled out in a series of cutscenes that unlock by finishing a certain number of multiplayer matches and small codex entries that are awarded at the end of each match.The story of Exoprimal is overly complicated, with time travel and different dimensions drowning out the ongoing problem of dinosaur storms. It does a great job of not boring you with the details, saving that for the codex system, which contains smaller bits of information that you can engage with if you want to. Instead, the main cutscenes deal directly with the drama of your team seeing future and alternate versions of themselves, as well as the main conflict against the AI named Leviathan. It won't emotionally move you, but it's good enough that you probably won't skip the cutscenes when they do pop up. The convoluted story of a rogue AI forcing Exofighters from across different dimensions and timelines to fight simulated waves of dinosaurs in order to build the perfect exosuit isn't super compelling, but the way it impacts the actual missions is.The first example of this is when Magnum, an NPC Exofighter, goes rogue to enter one of your multiplayer instances to collect data on Leviathan, prompting the AI to get angry. Leviathan ups the difficulty, literally, spawning in the first appearance of a massive raptor storm. In previous missions, you would be tasked with taking down a few hundred raptors in a single instance, but this time you need to take down over 1,000 to clear the mission. This difficulty spike came as a welcome surprise nearly a dozen matches in, especially as the repetitiveness of those early missions begins to wear on you, and Exoprimal continues to mix it up regularly from there.The variety of objectives in multiplayer increases drastically, with capture points and barriers that must be destroyed with giant hammers you charge by killing dinosaurs. There are also special co-op missions, where both teams work together to fight massive waves of special dinosaurs and even raid bosses against a neo T-Rex. The co-op missions are where the gameplay of Exoprimal truly shines, unleashing an overwhelming number of dinosaurs to fight against. While the first few hours of Exorprimal could use more variety, there is plenty of new content to see later on.In addition to the new missions, you get more customization options for your Exosuits based on how long you play and your match performance. There are 10 suits at launch, split into the damage, tank, and support categories. Each category has one suit to unlock by reaching a certain player level and spending the required in-game currency, and each suit has its own individual level. While you can't customize the majority of abilities each suit has, you can choose one rig, which offers a specific skill. In addition to that, there are modules that you unlock that can improve overall stats or exosuit-specific abilities. There are far more modules than you have slots for, so you can tailor your selection to your playstyle. If you like getting headshots as Vigilant, you can pick a module that rewards hitting those skillshots. If you prefer relying on Vigilant's freeze ability, there is a module that improves that skill. While none of these modules feel like game-altering bonuses, the ability to tailor each suit to your playstyle feels rewarding.Capcom made the smart choice of not limiting the number of each suit-type a team can have. Everyone can wear the exact same suit, five different damage suits, or a classic setup with two tanks, two damage-dealers, and a healer, letting your squad implement a wide range of tactics. It also doesn't lock you into a losing setup, either, with the option to switch both your Exosuit and rig at any time during a match with no consequences for doing so. Since most matches are a race, being able to swap quickly when something isn't working is incredibly important and makes it feel like you always have a chance to make a comeback.Another important part of the gameplay are the dinosaurs, of which there are a ton. The most common enemy are the raptors, which primarily serve as cannon fodder meant to overwhelm a team more than anything else. As for the rest of the enemies, each one has something unique about it, giving a different feel. The Triceratops has a hard head, making it take almost no damage from the front, and the Stegosaurus has a loud cry, which disables all non-movement abilities of anyone in range. There are also the neo dinosaurs, which have been modified to have special abilities. These typically include using different elemental attacks, like fire or ice, making for a challenging foe. The stronger dinosaurs force better teamwork to overcome, rewarding smart gameplay and forcing you to adapt on the fly.Leveling up and completing missions offers reward, but the majority of these feel insignificant. Unlocking different modules is great, but the other rewards you earn are loot boxes, awarding random cosmetics and coins, which are used to upgrade modules and unlock new Exosuits. Some of the cosmetics are interesting, like the Krieger suit that turns you into a giant playing card or the Zephyr skin that looks like a Power Ranger, but most are simple color swaps. As for the coins, the economy of Exoprimal is a bit broken. I had what felt like an unlimited number of coins fairly quickly and was able to fully upgrade any module I wanted without feeling like I'm short on cash. These rewards being unexciting meant that the only driving force to boot up another match was seeing what sort of missions Exoprimal still hadn't shown me, and the thrill of fighting dinosaurs.There is a battle pass to progress, but the cosmetic rewards in the premium tier are only marginally better than the selection of free cosmetics. There are a few legendary rewards, but those come near the end of the pass, which takes awhile to progress through. There aren't any challenges, so the only progress comes from completing matches, which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't so slow.Another flaw of Exoprimal is the matchmaking system, which doesn't offer much control over which matches you get placed into. You can choose either PvP- or PvE-focused missions, or select both for an XP bonus, almost forcing you to pick both. You can't select individual objective types, nor can you queue specifically for the big co-op missions. While this system does typically give a good mix of mission types, it does have one major flaw. The early missions, which have simple objectives and only simple dinosaurs, don't get taken out once you progress in the story. This means you can go from a nail-biting raid fight to fighting only a handful of raptors at once, which feels quite boring and simplistic with late-game modules and upgrades.While Exoprimal's early hours of repetitive and simple missions will likely drive some people away, its later surprises are a delight for those willing to give it the necessary time. The escalation of difficulty and the wide variety of objectives introduced later on in the shooter gives it fresh life several hours in. Fighting through an ocean of dinosaurs is a ton of fun and the variety of enemies keeps you from falling into a repetitive combat loop. The story isn't anything special, but tying it to new multiplayer content makes progressing it a bit more compelling. Exoprimal is ultimately a great time and a unique multiplayer experience."
3242,Venetica,5.0,1,"            Mediocre combat in a role-playing game can often be mitigated by a wealth of unlockable abilities, but Venetica offers no such reward. As you level up, you do get to sink points into your four core attributes, and there are additional moves you gain access to, but this has such a small effect on the gameplay that it's little more than a tease. The magic attacks are quite tame--you can summon crows or slow enemies down, for instance--and they are so cumbersome to use that they serve little purpose other than add diversity when you get bored with spamming the attack button. There's almost no reason to use these spells for the vast majority of fights. First of all, many enemies are resistant to your stronger spells (demons are immune to any health-draining attack, for example), so during those moments when you really need a bit of razzle-dazzle, your opponent is frustratingly resilient. Furthermore, most attacks have such a large recharge time that if you do use a spell one time, you'll end up finishing off any enemy with sword attacks before you even have a chance to cast another spell. Finally, you have only five free buttons to map special abilities to. Considering you have blocks, health items, magic spells, and sword flourishes for these few buttons, it's hard to take advantage of all the skills at your disposal.           "
1833,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,7.0,2,"Borderlands 2 at a fundamental level. However, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel still manages to breathe some life into the cold vacuum of space, and flying high in the low gravity of Elpis, Pandora’s moon, brings a fresh take on combat and exploration, even though some story elements never reach escape velocity. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel tells the tale of how Jack, a low-level Hyperion Corporation employee (despite his massive office), became the face of terror known as Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2. But the story behind the villain isn’t as interesting as the character himself. Jack shined in Borderlands 2; he was antagonizing, sarcastic, and possessed of an evil that inspired awe. This particular narrative, however, treats his nuances and personality quirks as a checklist, with every line explaining his hatred of bandits or his distaste for claptraps promptly scratched off because it must be. In fact, much of the power that Handsome Jack wields in Borderlands 2 (such as his robot army) seems to come to him coincidentally throughout the events of the Pre-Sequel, and with little input from you, the player. In Borderlands 2, you play a major role; here, the predetermined plot is king, only requiring you to kill the right bad guys and press the right buttons. It's disappointing to be an impartial and unnecessary observer to Jack’s transformation, rather than a catalyst for it. Pre-Sequel introduces several non-playable characters to help you on your quest, but they aren’t as formidable as your friends on Pandora. Janey Springs takes on engineering duty, and though she has a charming personality, she never commands the scene like Scooter can. The role of child genius is taken by the cockney-voiced Pickle, who is no replacement for the hilariously unstable Tiny Tina. On the other hand, Nurse Nina, who replaces Dr. Ned, is a great addition. She's an imposing woman with a thick Russian accent, and her love of medicine is only matched by the joy she feels when witnessing someone’s suffering. Ex-vault hunters Lilith and Roland also make appearances, but they spend most of the game in Moxxi’s bar emitting monosyllabic grunts and brief sentences. There is a reason for them being here, but that purpose doesn’t reveal itself until much later. Nevertheless, it’s unfortunate to see such prominent characters taking a background role for most of the game. Each of the four new playable vault hunters comes prepared with a powerful action skill designed to aid--or hinder--in battles against an onslaught of enemy humans, monsters, and machines. Athena, as the gladiator, equips a shield that absorbs a finite amount of incoming damage before being hurled back in a resulting explosion of kinetic energy. Wilhelm the enforcer calls on two flying robotic allies named Wolf and Saint. Wolf showers enemy forces in hails of gunfire or missiles, while Saint hovers around Wilhelm, healing his injuries. The bots are useful not just as extra allies on the field, but during tactical retreats: releasing the drones when your health reaches critical levels allows one bot to heal you while the other keeps enemies busy. Nisha the gunslinger automatically targets enemies while earning boosts in weapon damage, accuracy, fire rate, reload speed, and bullet speed, which are great boons during boss battles. Where Nisha’s ability doesn’t shine, however, is when confronting enemies that fling targetable projectiles. Flicking the mouse or thumbstick allows you to switch targets, but sometimes the reticle gets confused, unsure of which object is an enemy and which isn’t. Claptrap the fragtrap, however, has the most interesting action skill of them all. Claptrap scans the area with his VaultHunter.exe program and chooses a skill that best suits the situation. That skill might be that of a fellow vault hunter, or, if you put skill points into Claptrap's fragmented fragtrap path, you might increase the fire rate of your weapons, or turn into a rolling bomb. With a quick scan, you may dual-wield your equipped weapon, mimicking Salvador the gunzerker, or slip into a rubber-duck outfit and reflect bullets while bouncing around like something out of a Saturday-morning cartoon. The best aspect of Claptrap's abilities, however, is that his action skill affects everyone on the team, so when Claptrap starts bouncing around, so does everyone else. Some of these transformations are welcome boons for your teammates; wielding two firearms during a hectic boss fight is rarely bad news, after all. But sometimes, the random and comical ride that is Claptrap the vault hunter can draw impatient sighs from your annoyed partners. Other times, Claptrap tosses out a miniontrap, a miniature version of himself. The miniontrap is powered by a vault hunter ability, such as a small rocket turret (thus mimicking the soldier or commando classes), or a winged blight bot that deals fire and corrosive damage (mirroring Maya’s blight phoenix skill, as it were). Miniontraps bring humor to any firefight, taunting enemies or beatboxing dubstep. When all enemies are gone, Claptrap and his robotic minion sometimes tell each other lame knock-knock jokes, which is sure to leave a smile on your face or, at least, a groan in your throat. Claptrap can also play the role of team support by unloading points into an ability that adds a bonus to weapon damage and reload speed, as well as create a healing aura around downed enemies. The story behind the villain isn’t as interesting as the character himself. Like in Borderlands 2, all four vault hunters are given three sets of skill trees that grant the freedom of customizing your character to suit your play style. Athena can follow a path that adds more abilities to her shield, such as healing, or she can invoke the power of Captain America and have the shield ricochet off several enemies. Wilhelm can focus his points into either Wolf or Saint, raising their combat effectiveness, while Nisha can improve her skills with pistols or her trusty whip. Claptrap can play the role of team support by unloading points into an ability that adds a bonus to weapon damage and reload speed, as well as create a healing aura around killed enemies. The moon Elpis is a treacherous, scarred rock complete with its own set of challenges and dangers to overcome. Without air to breathe, you now must use O2 Kits, or Oz kits, to provide a steady supply of oxygen. But Oz kits are not unlimited, and you must be vigilant lest you be left gasping for air. Oxygen isn’t all too scarce, however; the cragged lunar surface is dotted with oxygen geysers that can refill your air canister, and structures, atmosphere generators, and vehicles that also offer precious Oz are plentiful. You can double jump when equipped with an Oz kit, allowing you to leap onto tall buildings and high cliffs, or over wide chasms. The low gravity and new weapons provide a welcome twist on the old Borderlands combat formula. Combat doesn’t slow down with the loss of gravity; in fact, it only gets more exciting. Leaping high into the air allows you to slam back down to the ground in a powerful air stomp, which is a fantastic new way to injure multiple enemies at once. This combat move is almost intoxicating: you feel like an action hero, flying through the air in slow motion while raining hellfire onto your enemies on the ground before butt-stomping the life out of injured stragglers. Oz kits can also offer small status boosts, such as elemental resistance or increased accuracy, as well as charging the shock wave with fire or corruption damage. Claptrap and his robotic minion sometimes tell each other lame knock-knock jokes, which is sure to leave a smile on your face or, at least, a groan in your throat. Combat awareness is key, however, as enemies can also use the stomp against you. But your enemies need air as much as you do, and shattering their face protectors momentarily stuns them and allows the vacuum of space to cause additional damage. Scavengers, or scavs, make up the bulk of human enemies found on Elpis, though the moon is also home to other creatures, such as armored kraggons that split into two when killed. There are two new types of weaponry to use in your fight against these creeps. Laser guns, ranging from beam rifles to blasters, add a dash of futuristic tech to any fight. A new form of cryogenic element, replacing slag, allows you to slow down or freeze enemies (possibilities that never get old), and shattering them to pieces with a melee attack is always a cold, tasty treat. There’s something poetic about using a cryo-sniper rifle to freeze an enemy’s head and watching it fracture into a dozen frozen bits that then float away into space. Elpis is a beautiful place to behold, yet with its deep craters and creepy multi-eyed extraterrestrials it feels like a hostile and alien world. The impressive lighting effects emanating from the sun and reflected from the not-too-distant Pandora bathe the landscape in rich shades of purple, blue, and orange. Elpis is wrapped in a constant night sky that sparkles with stars; the only other celestial objects to be seen are various meteors, as well as Pandora and the massive Helios space station looming over the land below. Some areas glow red with hot magma that pools at the bottom of vast crevasses, while other sections glow blue with ice-cold pools of water. Elpis, however, doesn’t offer as many areas as in Borderlands 2, and the environments don't vary much beyond the aforementioned blend of colors, craters, and canyons, which make the areas feel repetitious after a dozen or so hours. Traveling across the land can be done by foot, but it's more convenient to use one of Pre-Sequel's two new vehicles. Unfortunately, one of them, the moon buggy, is a disaster on four wheels. A slight bump in the road can send it reeling off course, and trying to control it via mouse and keyboard is nigh impossible. The stingray, a one-seated hovercraft, is a far more stable choice. Armed with cryo-rockets or a flak cannon, the stingray is slow but versatile, and a joy to control. With the press of a button, it can fly high into the air, allowing it to soar over lava-filled gorges. It is also armed with its own version of the butt stomp, making it the most combat-effective of the two vehicles. This wouldn’t be a Borderlands game without awesome loot, and Pre-Sequel doesn’t disappoint. Weapons, shields, Oz kits, and grenade mods, all with randomized stats, drop from fallen enemies and appear in chests and trash bins. Don’t worry: from Maliwan to Jakobs, all of your favorite death-dealing brands have made the short jump to Pandora’s moon. The only notable change is the loss of the Bandit brand in favor of Scav. Choosing the right weapon and gear is one of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel's finest pleasures. Whether you prefer getting up close with a thunderous shotgun, or staying in the shadows while picking off enemies with a high-precision sniper rifle, you can bet that there is gear that will enhance your battle proficiency. Combining the varying skill trees with the right gear allows you to create a vault hunter unique to you, even if you’re not the only Nisha in a team. Further customization includes character skins and heads, many of which can be found as unlockable items along with regular loot. Don’t worry: from Maliwan to Jakobs, all of your favorite death-dealing brands have made the short jump to Pandora’s moon. Unfortunately, pursuing side quests reveals a number of Pre-Sequel's pacing issues. While missions don’t venture far from the usual design of “go here, kill this guy” or “get this key, then come back,” typical to Borderlands, some of the side quests have you repeatedly going through the same areas multiple times, to the point that attempting to finish every quest become tiresome. One level later in the game is nearly devoid of combat, but you are summoned there at least four times. It’s enough to have you sighing with every accelerated launch from a jump pad. These mostly empty missions make the game feel bloated with a lack of interesting content. Other issues are technical. It’s remarkably easy to get stuck in walls or behind containers, but you’re not the only one to suffer from such annoyances. At times, non-playable characters clip into walls, making it difficult to activate or finish a quest. Another occasional irritation is when the game doesn’t let you talk to quest givers in order to complete a mission. This usually requires that everyone quit out of the game and reload. There is still a ton to do once the main campaign is complete. Once you have finished the story, several endgame missions are unlocked, as well as a raid boss. Much to my disappointment, however, the raid boss isn’t a completely different foe, but a more challenging version of the story’s final boss fight. You also unlock True Vault Hunter Mode, in which you can play through the campaign again, facing tougher enemies for better loot, and earn more levels up to the cap of 50. In your first run of the game, a captured Athena narrates the tale as the original vault hunters offer comments and occasional jokes. But in True Vault Hunter Mode, they are replaced by Tiny Tina and Brick, whose hilarious antics make your second trip all the more worthwhile. Repetition and a lackluster story are its biggest shortcomings, but Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is different enough to separate itself from the shadows of its older siblings. Elpis provides some gorgeous scenery, and the low-gravity environments bring an exciting new dynamic exploration and combat. No, it never reaches the furthest edges of space, but Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel still offers some the best of what the series has to offer: good loot, good laughs, and good times for many hours.  "
719,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,9.0,2,"While Bloodborne tweaked the combat dynamics of Dark Souls to encourage aggression, Sekiro rewrites the rules of engagement. The building blocks of its combat are recognisable, but this only serves to lure Soulsborne veterans into a false sense of security. Sekiro's combat is incredibly demanding, asking you to study your opponent, find the perfect moment to engage, and execute a split-second follow-up that, if done right, will end the battle in a matter of moments--or if done wrong will end you just as fast.This might sound akin to what every other From Software game asks of you, but Sekiro pushes these demands further than Dark Souls and Bloodborne ever did. Over the years, From Software fans have become accustomed to the language of Soulsborne games; we recognise scenarios and are wise to the tricks, we can identify viable strategies more quickly, and since the skills are transferable, we can execute these strategies with a measure of confidence. But Sekiro challenges this expertise. It invites you to try and then shows you how little you're actually capable of. Sekiro is affirmation that From Software hasn't lost its bite; that its games can make you feel vulnerable and strike fear in a way few others can. It's a heart-pounding, palm-sweating, and nerve-wracking gameplay experience that instills tension the likes of which I haven't felt since first playing Demon's Souls.Souls players predominantly hide behind shields and adopt a hit and run approach to combat, and Bloodborne's attack-focused dynamic was a response to this. Similarly, the crux of Sekiro's combat has its origins in Dark Souls. The Poise stat was used to govern how resistant a player was to being staggered or stun-locked by an attack. Sekiro reworks this into a defensive attribute called Posture and uses it to underpin its engagements. Attacks chip away at Posture and will eventually break through the defense, leaving an enemy open to a Deathblow or to having their health attacked directly, which in turn makes their Posture slower to recover. However, this is a very laborious way to wear enemies down, and they will often defiantly counterattack to deal big damage to you. Instead the goal is to deflect an attack the moment before it hits you, which wears down Posture considerably faster.For low-level enemies it takes just a few encounters to get into the rhythm of it, but as more foes are introduced, it becomes much trickier. Each one has a variety of attacks that have specific tells and counter timings, so spending the time to learn how they all behave and how you should react is vital. Thematically, this style of combat is also coherent with the subject matter of the game in a way that I really appreciate. Battles are measured--a ballet of back and forth movements, the outcome decided by a deadly flourish--swift and precise, as any contest between swordsmen should be.However, the true test is when you're faced with Sekiro's boss enemies. Calling these encounters ""challenging"" would be a severe understatement. The attacks these enemies unleash are deadly, to the point where just a single blow can often be enough to kill you. Their moves can be as erratic as they are diverse, and for some of them parrying is simply not an option. Occasionally a red kanji symbol will briefly appear to signal that an unblockable attack is on its way, and in this situation the options are to either jump, dodge to the side, or hope you can sprint away fast enough. In a single second you'll need to identify the attack and execute the appropriate action to save yourself. Bosses have the most Posture and usually require you to land multiple Deathblows on them before they fall, so attempting to simply chip away only draws the battle out. The longer you spend in the battle, the more mentally taxing it becomes. The stress of repeatedly nailing split-second counters begins to mount and just a single slip-up is all it takes to lose everything. As a consequence, these boss battles feel designed to force you to engage with the enemy, to take the fight to them and hope that you've got what it takes. In the moment it can feel unbearably frustrating to keep banging your head up against the challenge, but that frustration pales in comparison to the sheer exhilaration of finally breaking through. After almost every boss battle I completed, I was so overwhelmed by the adrenaline that I had to put the controller down and give myself the time to settle.Death isn't necessarily the end, however, as Sekiro gives you the option to either submit and die to respawn at a checkpoint, or revive on the spot and continue fighting. This mechanic makes the game just a touch more forgiving by allowing you to recompose yourself and get back in the fight, but it comes at a cost. Each death and each revival has an impact on the world around you. More specifically, it has an impact on the characters you've met on your journey. To explain exactly what that is would be to spoil one of the most interesting parts of Sekiro, so I won't do that, but suffice it to say that death and resurrection has a meaningful consequence beyond just making you lose experience and money.In battle, your character, Wolf, has his fair share of tricks. He's equipped with a prosthetic arm that is capable of having different sub-weapons grafted to it, and they're essential in giving yourself an edge in combat. There's an axe that, while slow to swing, can break through shields; a spear that allows you attack from further away, and can be used to pull weaker enemies towards you or strip armor; firecrackers which can stun enemies; or a flamethrower that can inflict burn damage.Using these prosthetics comes at a cost, however, as they consume Spirit Tokens. These are scattered around the world and can be purchased using Sen, the in-game currency awarded for killing enemies, but you can only hold a limited quantity of them while in the field. This limitation reinforces the idea that they are to be used as part of a strategy instead of relied on as the primary way to defeat enemies. Using them unnecessarily could mean that they're not available when you need them most. Resources such as scrap, gunpowder, and wax can be found to upgrade your prosthetic arsenal and open up new ways to use them.Wolf's own shinobi abilities can also be developed by spending experience points gained from killing enemies. Unlike previous From Software titles, there isn't a steady stream of new weaponry; the katana is your mainstay throughout, but new Combat Arts flesh out how the sword can be used, and they have a more active role in skirmishes. Whirlwind Slash, for example, lets you control space, while Ichimonji is a heavy overhead strike that has a long windup but dishes out big posture damage. Again, they're designed as an additional strategic consideration. Only one of these can be equipped at a time, so this forces you to think about what you're taking into battle and be methodical in utilizing it. Shinobi Arts, meanwhile, allow you to access skills such as mid-air deflections, vaulting over enemies to deliver backstabs, and specific counters for deadly special moves that enemies will occasionally execute. These various upgrades aren't diverse enough to support dramatically different playstyles, but they do offer just enough room to find a favourable loadout and then develop its effectiveness.Wolf also has a suite of Innate Abilities, some of which come into play outside of combat. It's here that Sekiro really distinguishes itself from previous From Software titles by revealing itself to be a stealth action game--one that proudly wears its origins as a spiritual successor to the Tenchu series. Most areas have a heavy enemy presence so the odds are stacked against you. Engaging in open combat will draw attention to your presence, so the smarter strategy is to thin out the opposition by systematically picking them off. In previous From Software games, this would involve an awkward kiting process where you edge closer to a single enemy and use items or ranged attacks to lure it into a safer zone to do battle. However, Sekiro has mechanics to support stealth play more directly. You can use your grappling hook to take to the rooftops and scout out a location, taking a note of enemy placements and watching their patrol patterns. You can skulk around buildings, pressing yourself against surfaces to peek around corners. You can shimmy up walls and hang of ledges to reposition, leap off elevated points to plunge your katana into enemies below, or slither under raised buildings and into grass, creeping towards unsuspecting victims. Innate Abilities such as Suppress Presence will make your footsteps quieter, while the ceramic shard item can be thrown to make noise and manipulate movements to your advantage. Being effective with stealth can allow you to circumvent standard combat encounters entirely, so it's in your best interest to take it slow and steady. Enemy behaviour can be inconsistent, however. Sometimes they'll stare through you as if you're not there, and other times they become hyper aware and capable of perfectly tracking your movements during an alert phase, even when you're behind walls or hiding on roofs. They're not particularly sophisticated, but their lethality means they're not to be taken lightly.The absence of modern stealth conveniences means you place greater scrutiny on your surroundings, and you'll notice just how thoughtfully they've been constructedThere's a simplicity to Sekiro's stealth mechanics that is refreshing. There's no Detective Mode or on-screen indicators to signify how much noise you're making, and instead you're entirely reliant on your basic senses. The absence of these modern stealth genre conveniences means you place greater scrutiny on your surroundings, and you'll notice just how thoughtfully they've been constructed.The geography of From Software's game worlds are much lauded, with praise heaped upon the way seemingly disparate locations slowly reveal themselves to be interconnected and part of a cohesive whole. That strength of world design is present in Sekiro, and the fact that it's more immediately visible within these contained locations makes taking the stealth approach even more satisfying. Buildings are placed together to encourage exploration and reconnaissance, with roofs almost touching so that you can leap between them and scope out all angles. They overhang just enough that you can take a running jump and use your grappling hook to swing up and across for better vantage points. Pathways diverge and reconnect, creating that satisfying feeling of venturing into the unknown and then emerging into the familiar. Thick tree branches protruding out from the side of mountains can be grappled to and used to sneak into the heart of an area undetected, or around it entirely. There were more than a few occasions where I spotted a temple in the distance, traced the pathway there back to where I was standing, and followed it to discover a hidden area.Sekiro takes place in Japan, in a land known as Ashina. As a consequence, it is by and large more grounded in reality than the likes of Lordran or Yarhnam. The location remains both striking and memorable, however. Encircled by an ever-visible snowy mountain range, Ashina is built up of dilapidated temples scattered around, housing mercenary warriors and corrupted monks, among other dangerous foes. Man-made pathways dissolve into perilous valleys, where mountainsides must be scaled to reach remote forests patrolled by club-wielding ogres. Fortified castles tower above abandoned towns seized by an army. Ornate statues fill the homes of royalty, while questionable characters linger in the dungeons below. Without spoiling it, Sekiro also takes the opportunity to delve into the supernatural and pull from Japanese mythology.That juxtaposition of the real and the fantastical is echoed in the story Sekiro tells. It begins simply, with a shinobi that is called into action to save his kidnapped master and uphold his iron oath. But beneath the surface there's more at play--Ashina is a nation on the brink of collapse, its people beset by a mysterious stagnation, and you have the power to decide its fate--familiar themes for From Software. However, the story quickly moves from the realm of warlords driven by ambition to one of mythical bloodlines, demonic monsters, and otherworldly spirits. While the story is undoubtedly told in a more direct fashion than Dark Souls and Bloodborne, there are still numerous nuances to explore, and mysteries to solve, perfect fodder for a rampant community that has built up around From Software's games to mine. Softly muttered lines from Ashina's denizens hint at turmoil from days gone, while item descriptions speak to arcane practices. Talk of far off lands colours in the world around Ashina, while vague mentions of enigmatic figures leaves you questioning what unseen forces are involved in the events that are transpiring.The unflinching way Sekiro punishes you for missteps and the repetition of trial and error are clearly suited for people of a certain temperament and with a very specific, slightly masochistic taste in games. These are the people that are willing to endure devastating defeats for hours on end and watch as their progress is undone time and time again, just so they can have the intoxicating thrill of overcome a seemingly insurmountable challenge that awaits at the end. In that respect, Sekiro is unmistakably a From Software game--but one unlike any we've had so far. When all is said and done, though, it's the combat that has left the deepest marks on me, for better and for worse.Atop Ashina Castle I stood before a swordsman. It wasn't my first attempt at the duel; we'd been trading steel for close to six hours, and each time the swordsman ruthlessly cut me down. I became desperate. I started making bad decisions. The losses were really getting to me. But I persevered.My plan was a familiar one, honed through years of repeated Dark Souls and Bloodborne play: observe, dodge, wait for a slow attack, and use the opening to strike--it never fails. He swung his sword and I was out of range. The recovery on the attack was slow so it was the perfect opportunity to land a blow--I'd done it hundreds of times by that point. Except, this time it was different. As I charged in, he quickly corrected himself and fired an arrow, then chased behind it to close the distance and delivered a crushing blow. I lost my composure and finally snapped.I picked myself up off the ground and rushed at him. He began an onslaught of attacks and, after six hours of learning his style and developing the muscle memory, I just started parrying on instinct. Each one of his swings and each arrow he fired was met with a perfectly timed raise of my sword. Every unblockable attack he lunged at me with was sidestepped or hopped immaculately. I watched as his Posture deplete, edging closer to the breaking point, and at the same time I could feel my breathing become more rapid, my thumbs beginning to tremble. I wore him down and delivered a Deathblow, backed away, and did it all over again, and a third time. In that final moment when I pierced through him with my katana, I was completely overcome with emotion. After six gruelling hours of failure, the winning battle lasted just six minutes. I'm not too proud to admit that I cried, and I'd do it all over again.The orchestration of intense one-on-one boss encounters that truly test your mettle, and slower-paced stealth sections that let you take on battles at your own pace, is masterful. More so than in previous games, From Software has honed in on the inherent tension found in the challenging nature of its games, and uses it to incredible effect. Sekiro marries the developer's unique brand of gameplay with stealth action to deliver an experience that is as challenging as it is gratifying."
741,Yo-kai Watch 3,6.0,1,"If you had to explain Yo-kai Watch in a nutshell to someone who's never heard of or played it, you might boil it down to ""Pokemon but with Japanese ghosts"" or ""Baby's first Shin Megami Tensei."" Anything grim or distressing about a kid who can talk to ghosts goes by the wayside when the ghosts are comical entities like a missing left sock or a possessed police car. In this third expansive and quirky outing for the Yo-kai Watch series, our hero Nate has to take on a quest far more daunting than anything he’s faced so far: moving to America.Specifically, Nate's family ends up moving to BBQ, an over-the-top caricature of Texas, for his dad's job, and finds that the U.S. has supernatural problems all its own that he and his best yokai buddies, a cat named Jibanyan and an uber-effete ghost butler named Whisper, have to handle. Meanwhile, back in Nate's hometown of Springdale (which is located in Japan), a bubbly ball of nerdy energy named Hailey-Anne is enticed into buying a Yo-kai Watch of her own, which ties her to Usapyon, a ghost astronaut rabbit. Stuck with each other, they form a detective agency.That's really over-the-top as far as a game aimed squarely at a younger audience goes, and that's largely a result of how it's been localized. Yo-kai Watch 3 was originally two games in Japan, with Nate and Hailey-Anne's stories comprising a game each. The version released in the West has combined the two, allowing players to switch to the other campaign at will, before the two stories converge in the later hours. It's a daring choice that allows you a ton of control over how you experience the sprawling narrative, but it also highlights just how much the narrative didn't need to sprawl to begin with. The first major plot points of both stories--Nate meeting a boy in BBQ who can see yokai as well, and Hailey-Anne starting the detective agency--are a good five or six hours in. Having both stories in the same package is a positive, but having to manually thread together two stories that could already stand to be a little more concise is less so.On the plus side, that does give you ample reason to slow down and really take in your surroundings, which is really one of the greater joys in this game. Despite the aesthetic, the interpretations of Japan and Texas are surprisingly intricate places full of people worth speaking to and places to wander off to. As the game went on, one of my favorite things to do in it was to ride the trains in Springdale, missing stops just to look around. In addition, Nate's story has the compelling element of him trying to get accustomed to American culture, and on occasion, work you do in one of the towns--unlocking an app, or asking someone for a favor--affects the story in the other. But by and large, much of the first half of the game has both Nate and Hailey-Anne doing random fetch quests or being distracted with the game's numerous side missions, which are fun but wholly tangential from the main game. That creates a major problem with pacing early on.Yo-kai Watch has always been an accessible series, and this third entry is no different. The cycle of gameplay usually boils down to Nate finding a possessed human doing something unusual, using the watch to reveal the yokai controlling them, and getting into a simple showdown with it. After these battles, there's a strong chance it joins your menagerie of friendly yokai who can be used to fight other yokai--of which there are a whopping 600-plus. There are very few of what seasoned RPG veterans might consider a dungeon, and when there are, as long as you've found at least six yokai you like, you can blow through nearly all of them in mere minutes, with no real pressing need to collect more except for the sheer joy of collecting them.Combat does ostensibly have some measure of depth compared to the series' predecessors, with the addition of a 3x3 grid system that allows you to move yokai around to dodge attacks and pick up special items. There's also plenty of information about each yokai which you can put to good use, such as elemental weaknesses and their preferred food. That's all alongside familiar mechanics like quirky mini-games used to heal yokai that have been afflicted with status effects or to charge up ultimate (or more accurately, Soultimate) attacks. But with the exception of the occasional boss fight and the rather welcome difficulty spike of the final third of the game, it's rare that you actually have to utilize any of these mechanics. So much of the game's combat is a passive experience, but neglecting to have a full grasp of it when the game finally expects you to be proactive in battle will eventually get you in serious trouble.These are the things that make Yo-kai Watch excellent as an introductory RPG for beginners. For everyone else, however, the game has to endear itself in between major plot points on sheer charm which, thankfully, it's more than capable of delivering. On the Hailey-Anne side, what comes off as grating over-enthusiasm at the start settles down over time to become unflappable optimism and curiosity. The girl fears absolutely nothing, even when giant demons start showing up that send her running through the streets. Her alliance with Usapyon evolves from one of convenience to a genuinely sweet elementary school partnership over time, especially as the details of Usapyon's origins become clearer.Having both stories in the same package is a positive, but having to manually thread together two stories that could already stand to be a little more concise is less so.As mentioned, Nate's side has an even more intriguing angle. For some reason, the localization obscures the fact that Nate's hometown of Springdale is in Japan, but the touchstones of a kid dealing with severe culture shock are still here. Even when American culture is as hilariously exaggerated as it is, there's something subtly poignant about an ostensibly Japanese kid exploring an all-American city for the first time. And as his circle of friends expands to include Buck, a wild-haired kid with a deep southern drawl, so too does his experience with American yokai and all the loud and proud aspects of such.It's still a game aimed at a young crowd, though, and the game's poignancy is undercut a bit by wild reactions, non-sequitur humor, and impromptu j-pop musicals. Most of the scarier aspects of the game dealing with the existence and management of the afterlife have been softened to the absolute extreme. The game was only ever going to get so serious, and the winking nods to more adult fare like The Godfather, Fist of the North Star, The X-Files, and Twin Peaks are indeed just that: playful winks. It's less the competitive Growlithe-eat-Growlithe world of Pokemon than a cheerful, wacky playground where Pokemon-like creatures happen to live.There's not much to Yo-kai Watch 3, but there’s still a lot of charm to be found. The towns of Springdale and BBQ are both bright, pleasant places to be; the people in it are even more so. Visiting the world of Yo-kai Watch for the third time is a fun time, even though you’ll end up staying a lot longer than perhaps necessary."
4309,Operation Shadow,4.0,0," Not to be confused with the similarly titled Shadow Ops, which was recently released on the PC and Xbox, Operation Shadow is a third-person-perspective, arcade-style shooter that's defined by its faster-than-life pacing and intolerably campy dialogue. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to 3DO's critically panned Army Men 3D games, Operation Shadow shares many of the shortcomings of that series. While its frenetic action is a refreshing reprieve from the numerous plodding, choppy shooters on the N-Gage, Operation Shadow still isn't recommendable, because its gameplay is so unbelievably mindless. Neither strategy nor skill will serve you here. Instead, your biggest asset will be the rote memorization of level layouts. Those who replay levels dozens of times will eventually uncover the keys to advancement, but they still won't have any fun.   In Operation Shadow, you play Jay, a thick-necked counterterrorist operative who's essentially a walking tank. So, naturally, he's as tough and as dense as one. Jay is frequently summoned to deal with terrorist uprisings around the globe by using his own brand of vigilante justice. While his lust for destruction makes him a danger to himself and to those around him, Jay has proven effective as a last line of defense against the steady stream of splinter groups that, if allowed to flourish, would surely threaten our democratic way of life. While this might sound like deliberate political satire--perhaps inspired by our current efforts to squelch Iraqi insurgents--be assured that there is no humor to be found in this bland shooter.      What you will encounter is painfully stilted dialogue between the pugnacious Jay and his dispatcher, a heavily decorated colonel who's equipped with a stately demeanor and an equally stately mustache. All conversation between the two follows a set format in which Jay will vociferously express his desire to devastate, only to meet the harsh reprove of the Colonel, who tirelessly stresses the importance of exercising caution. Of course, you wonder how reticence and calculation could benefit Jay, because he endeavors to both blow up buildings and execute war criminals, along with their legions of minions in black pajamas.   As various regions of the globe explode with terrorist activity, Jay is called in for cleanup duty. These groups of heavily armed miscreants have diverse names like the ""Ixan"" or the ""Red Dawn."" Operation Shadow won't restrict you to ""peacekeeping"" in the Middle East. Rather, it's a multicultural affair spanning several continents. After you complete a series of missions, a short newscast will summarize your progress and hint at where you'll next be headed.   Most of Jay's missions will somehow incorporate the use of one of the game's underpowered vehicles. In infantry mode, Jay has access to grenades, antitank missiles, and an assault rifle with unlimited ammo. However, most of the game's vehicles only sport a single machine gun that has a limited amount of ammunition. While grenade and missile ammo can be found easily, machine gun shells seem to be much less plentiful. To make matters worse, the enemies that have so much trouble hitting Jay (when he's on foot) seem to fare much better as soon as he steps into a vehicle. It's clear that Operation Shadow's developers were among the millions who played and enjoyed developer Bungie's breakthrough first-person shooter Halo. They correctly ascertained that Halo's vehicular combat was part of what made it uniquely outstanding. Unfortunately, Operation Shadow was unable to match that game's excellent implementation of vehicles. Here, they feel like another bullet point on a list of gameplay features. Most players will likely only use vehicles when the mission expressly requires it, or they'll just use vehicles for transportation between points A and B.      Operation Shadow's perfunctory multiplayer mode makes even poorer use of these crafts designed for land and air. Players are given the opportunity to deathmatch in a whopping four different environments, each of which is just about identical to the last, save for some color-palette swapping. Vehicles are plentiful on each of these maps. Unfortunately, however, server-filling bots are not. Playing against a single opponent, you'll spend the majority of your time putting around in your tank, Humvee, or buggy in an unavailing search for your would-be adversary. As it only takes one well-placed rocket to frag your foe (regardless of whether either of you has wheels), choosing a vehicle--even more grievously than in the single-player campaign--just makes you a bigger target.   In general, Operation Shadow's Bluetooth multiplayer feels like an afterthought (which is not to suggest that the single-player missions have benefited from a great deal of forethought). The run-and-gun gameplay that makes sense in areas glutted with enemies just seems ridiculous in the sparse multiplayer maps. Imagine if the hero of the arcade classic Gunsmoke tried to light up a ghost town. It would just be a poor use of his time. While Jay is only half the character Billy Bob was, he's equally ill-suited for wandering around vast, sparsely populated maps that look like they belong in a Tribes game rather than in an arcade-style shooter.   To Operation Shadow's credit, animation in both modes of play moves very, very quickly. Sadly, this fast frame rate is likely facilitated by the game's low graphical fidelity. Shadow's visual artists have used as few polygons as possible here, piecing together buildings and characters like tangrams. While this shows a high aptitude for spatial reasoning, the result is pretty ugly. Worse, when you move more than a few feet away from an object, it will abandon its third-dimension properties entirely, instead reverting to a sprite-based representation of itself. Recoil a bit more and it will pop out of existence entirely. Moreover, this formula actually works in reverse when you're approaching something.   It would be possible to forgive Operation Shadow's clunky graphics if they didn't severely hinder gameplay. The game features several types of enemies, each with different offensive abilities. It's important to be able to differentiate between these so you know you're not charging directly into the path of a missile-equipped tank. Unfortunately, it's impossible to know exactly what you're facing until it evolves beyond a blob of pixels, which means that you'll have to be almost on top of your enemy before you'll be able to ascertain its type.   Yet, even with all these shortcomings, Operation Shadow could have escaped infamy, if not for its incompetent mission design. Although your objectives are always accompanied by short descriptions, they don't elucidate particulars of the mission or advise you of relevant pitfalls you might face. For example, in an early mission, you're asked to rescue some prisoners of war by securing an enemy area. To do this, you'll have to destroy some of the opposition's barracks while sparing those that house your comrades. The only way to learn which buildings need to be destroyed is through simple trial and error.      The problems don't stop here. In another instance, you're charged with the task of ferrying important war documents to four headquarters before time elapses. You are chased by tanks and infantrymen, and, given your assignment's time restrictions, it would be too time-consuming to engage in combat with them. You're equipped with a tank, but it's required that you exit this tank to deliver the documents--a fact that is never expressly stated. While it would make sense to guide your character into these buildings to deliver the relevant papers, what you do instead is place him atop a nearby green target and then press the 2 key, which is the same one used to enter and exit a vehicle. This means you'll not only have to exit your tank, but also you'll have to leave it far enough away so that pressing the 2 key won't make you reenter it. To make matters worse, whenever you're close to an HQ, the tanks that are chasing you target the building itself in an attempt to destroy it. Should they succeed, you will fail in your mission. Of course, as soon as you leave the area, the tanks apparently forget about you and return to patrolling. Passing this level isn't a test of your shooting skill; it's a test of how many times you're willing to restart the mission, because Operation Shadow--fiendishly--doesn't allow you to save after completing individual objectives.   Operation Shadow's best feature is probably its audio, although this is hardly a ringing endorsement. The game's signature track is pervaded by some genuinely funky breakbeats, as well as a gritty and growling bassline that sounds like the result of some oscillator knob twisting on an old Moog synthesizer. You'll only truly appreciate the tune while hanging out in the game's menu, however. During gameplay, the music is greatly overpowered by the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire, and there's no option to balance the music and sound, either.   Operation Shadow is a very flawed game that would be impossible to recommend--for any price. It's amazing that such a title appears on store shelves alongside shooters like Gameloft's Jungle Storm or Torus' own Ashen. This is a game destined for the ""shadows"" of obscurity, which is just as well.  "
3548,Amazons &amp; Aliens,5.0,1,"Amazons &amp; Aliens tries to bring a sense of humor to the usually serious real-time strategy genre, but it doesn't quite succeed. The game isn't all bad, but its easy campaigns and straightforward, simplistic gameplay mean that it won't last you for very long.   Amazons &amp; Aliens is a real-time strategy game that focuses on empire building - you build up a town full of specialized buildings and manage your population so that enough food and raw materials are available and in use at all times. The game pits three very different-looking races against one another: bikini-clad Amazons, blue humanoids named Pimmons, and an insectlike race known as the Sajiki. Each race is sufficiently different in physical appearance and building style, but each has access to the same basic technology tree, which makes them all virtually equivalent in how they play. There are a few unique buildings available to the different races - for example, the questionable Sajiki Hall of Orgies - but each building has a rougly equivalent counterpart for the other races.   The gameplay is fairly typical of the genre. You start out with a master builder and a pair of grunt-type workers who carry raw materials to each building site. When nothing is being built, your grunts can gather food from nearby bushes. If you want to do anything more elaborate, you need to build a school and train hunters, miners, woodcutters, and other specialists.   The 2D graphics are tile-based and are well detailed for the most part. In fact, the graphics may be the game's strongest point. The terrain is well done, and many of the buildings look interesting. The various units are easily identifiable. Some are rather humorous, such as the Amazon diplomat who struts around wearing a giant top hat and carrying a little black briefcase. But most of the animations are simplistic, and in some instances, the game could have used some more polish. For example, when a worker drops off some materials at a building site, there's no trace of wood or stone on the ground.   The combat in Amazons &amp; Aliens has a similar problem and gives the sense that the game was intended to be as nonviolent as possible. Sure, you can build armies and attack your enemies, but you won't see any blood or gore when you defeat your foes. In fact, you won't even see any dead bodies or any smoke or fire when a building is destroyed. It's certainly true that a game doesn't need violent content to be good - but the absence of anything in this vein seems very odd in a game that includes a Hall of Orgies. Besides, to successfully vanquish an enemy in Amazons &amp; Aliens, you literally have to hunt down and slaughter every last one of his people - a harsh requirement in a game that's so visually sterile.   Another problem with Amazons &amp; Aliens is its level of difficulty. Anyone with a good amount of experience playing real-time strategy games should be able to cruise through Amazons &amp; Aliens in no time at all. Even though the documentation claims that the campaign for each race is more difficult than the last, you'll be hard-pressed to spot any significant differences between them. An ""endless"" game mode is also available, which lets you play the game for as long as you like as you build up your city. But unlike in most empire-building games, you'll probably be able to take over the entire map within a couple of hours in Amazons &amp; Aliens.   The computer opponent's artificial intelligence is not very smart, and it will waste time building houses, police stations, and confectioneries while your armies systematically destroy its cities. And even though the game includes a diplomacy feature, it pretty much is just on cruise control from the moment you build an embassy in your city. If you decide to make war on your neighbors and they send a diplomat to ask for peace, your embassy will immediately accept. The only impact this has on the game is in regard to trade: You cannot conduct trade with a race with which you are currently at war.   Amazons &amp; Aliens has its good points. The graphics are clean, the humorous theme generally works, and the variety of units and buildings available is impressive. But Amazons &amp; Aliens has no lasting appeal if you're experienced with other empire-building real-time strategy games. It's ultimately too simple and too easy."
2930,Rotastic,5.0,1,"          Every difficult level has the same problems because the controls are not up to the task. Levels require ultraspecific movement, and it's incredibly difficult to consistently pull off these exacting requests. Because of this, you often complete a stage by the skin of your teeth, which means you earn a mere bronze helmet. Without getting a high enough score for silver or gold, you can't unlock the later levels, so you're left replaying earlier stages with the desperate hope that you luck into a better ranking. And success does feel like luck in Rotastic. To get a high score, you have to pull off a string of almost-perfect moves in quick succession, and admittedly, it is a rush when you nail everything just as you should. But it's a rare moment when everything comes together, and you can only marvel at the implausibility of your landings. Did you really bounce off of two adjacent walls to nab that purple gem? How did you find room to squeak past that spiked log to hit the switch? The answers always come up the same: dumb luck. You never feel like a superstar because replicating these feats of brilliance is nearly impossible.        The roughly 70 single-player levels should keep dedicated players busy for a few hours, and if you crave more swinging action once you've gone through the gauntlet, there's a four-player, offline-only multiplayer mode as well. There are two different ways to play. Deathmatch involves slamming into your friends or trying to cut their rope so they fall into a bottomless void. Collect is the same thing, except the winner is determined by how many gems you nab, though it's still more entertaining to send your friends plummeting. Multiplayer is more fun than the single-player counterparts because everyone is plagued by the same handicap: imprecise controls. Because of this, slinging yourself willy-nilly through the world is goofy fun, given that there's no real punishment for failure. Sure, you may fall into a pit or miss out on collecting coins, but who cares? You're just challenging friends in some good-natured competition. Still, there isn't a draw to hook you long term. After playing two or three matches, the shallowness of the experience is overwhelming, so even if you enjoy multiplayer, you'll be hard pressed to find someone to join you.      Rotastic ultimately feels like it could have been released on a mobile device for one-tenth of the price. It doesn't take advantage of any of the Xbox 360's technical wizardry, and the simple control scheme combined with the shallow gameplay would be ideal in five-minute bursts while waiting for your train to arrive. Sadly, Rotastic exists only on a console that's tethered to a television, and it's hard to justify shelling out 800 Microsoft points ($10) for this forgettable experience. With better level design and controls that allowed you to move with precision, Rotastic could have offered a quiet respite from the spectacle of most big-budget retail releases. But there are too many frustrations for it to slide into that role. Rotastic briefly soars through the air, but it quickly plummets back to the earth with a dull thud.   "
2403,Donkey Kong Country Returns,7.0,2,"Donkey Kong Country Returns taught, building on its tried-and-true foundation with sublime level design and hefty--though always fair--challenge. While these strengths are still apparent in the portable version of the game, washed-out visuals and an unsteady framerate have put a damper on the action. Identifying the exact position of obstacles and platforms is tricky, and this has damaging consequences for the very elements that made the original so great. Because the run-and-jump action is still enjoyable, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is another lengthy and worthwhile platformer, but it can't live up to the standards of its big brother.        Returns 3D feels like a relic from a bygone era of platformers. The well-dressed simian runs and jumps through leafy jungles and boiling volcanic caves, collecting bananas with the unmatched determination of a hungry gorilla. Gone are the motion controls from the Wii original, replaced with precise button-tap commands that make it a snap to roll through enemies and pound the ground. Donkey Kong is a heavy primate, and that weight gives his movements a deliberate feel not often found in platformers. Getting used to his moderate jump height takes practice, and coming up short on a treacherous leap is a common occurrence given that it's easy to overestimate his athletic prowess. Thankfully, smashing a DK barrel teams you up with Diddy Kong, and the spry monkey's jetpack makes landing on those hard-to-reach ledges much easier.      It's in the level design that Returns 3D makes its mark. The worlds morph into twisted ruins as you tear through the eight exotic locales. Rocks crumble under your feet, and cliffs erupt from bottomless pits. Deep in the background, a bunch of bananas hangs over a tiny ledge. Leap into a nearby barrel, and you're whooshed to this new location, the world transforming around you to give you a place to run and jump and swing and yell. Returns 3D excels in these moments. The sheer unpredictability keeps you continually on edge, moving with a delicate mixture of confidence and caution as you react in the blink of a monkey's eye to the constantly changing world around you.         Though the geographic restlessness is the most thrilling aspect of Returns 3D, it also brings with it the largest frustrations. Framerate hitches are pervasive, a troublesome annoyance in sections that demand precision. Obstacles that were easy to identify on a large television screen are not nearly as visible when scaled down to the 3DS. Recognizing the danger zones and safe points when standing still takes only a moment of analysis, but problems surface when speed is paramount. Place Donkey Kong in a mine cart that's zooming through an underground cave, and spotting the minuscule specks that can end your life is incredibly tough. If you die a few times, you may memorize the deadly spots, but that's a weak solution to this issue. The same problem surfaces when the camera zooms out. It's clear that the levels and color schemes are ideal for a large screen, so when Returns was shrunk to a handheld, what was enjoyably difficult becomes aggravating.      The higher difficulty is offset somewhat by the aptly named New mode. This gives you special items that you can buy at Cranky Kong's shop that make it easier to stay alive. For instance, the Crash Guard power-up protects you from wiping out in those hellacious mine cart levels. It's nice that there is acknowledgment that the move to the 3DS comes with problems that didn't exist on a console. However, instead of fixing the glaring issue (poor visibility), these power-ups just make it harder to die. It's a lame compromise because these sections that were so incredible on the Wii are often tedious on the 3DS, with or without power-ups. Thankfully, there are only a handful of such levels in the game, and if you do get stuck, you can use the Super Guide feature to have the computer pass them for you.      At least there's one addition to Returns 3D that's a noticeable improvement. Eight new levels are buried within the Golden Temple which awaits at the end of your journey, and should challenge even those who complete the rest of the adventure. There are two ways to unlock this new content. Either play through the entirety of the core journey, including the bonus levels, or just buy a moderately priced orb from Cranky's shop. Either way, the toughest levels in Returns 3D are located behind the golden door, which is a great way to finish this fiendishly tough platformer. And for those who crave even more challenge, conquering this forsaken land unlocks Mirror mode, which strips you of your monkey sidekick and  some of your precious hearts. It's a challenge worthy of even the strongest of primates.        Although Returns 3D does suffer on the visual front, the stirring soundtrack sounds just as incredible on the 3DS. The catalog has been pulled from the original Donkey Kong Country games on the Super Nintendo, albeit in remixed form, along with new tracks that fit the jungle-explorer theme quite well. The music echoes the onscreen hijinks. The serene melody as you venture across sandy beaches matches the soothing power of the sea, and the music shifts gears to a more energetic beat when you board a flying barrel to steer through falling debris. It's an excellent soundtrack that does a great job of balancing classic tunes with new instrumentals to make something that stands on its own.     Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is an uneven update. The core elements that made the original so thrilling are still here, but visual problems turn the satisfying challenge into something that often feels unfair. Multi-card cooperative play doesn't help matters. Throwing anothing player into the mix makes it even harder to see what's going on. However, this is still a good game with tons of levels to explore and collectibles to uncover. Just don't expect to be awed by this aging gorilla.   "
4026,Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships,5.0,1,"  Most modern horseracing simulations, such as Tecmo's long-running Gallop Racer series, are intense exercises in statistics and Thoroughbred minutiae, which render them virtually impenetrable to those not already steeped in this pastime that is both regal and somewhat seedy. NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships strips away much of the density of the genre, making it more accessible but also robbing it of much of its depth.         One of the few advantages that NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships holds over its competition is its National Thoroughbred Racing Association seal of approval, which grants it use of more than a dozen real-world Thoroughbred racetracks, including Belmont Park, Del Mar, Emerald Downs, and Monmouth Park. The game also prominently features a number of Breeders' Cup winning horses, such as Smarty Jones, Man o' War, Funny Cide, and Seabiscuit. The game covers the three primary disciplines associated with horseracing--jockeying, stable management, and wagering. For pure on-the-track action, there's the quick race mode, where you can define the track, track surface, distance, the number of horses on the track, and weather conditions before choosing one of the game's fictional horses and hitting the track. You can also go in a head-to-head race with one of the featured Breeders' Cup winners in the ""challenge a champion"" mode.     It's typical for a horseracing game to take a somewhat hands-off approach to jockeying, and Breeders' Cup doesn't stray too far from this convention, allowing you to influence how hard the jockey pushes the horse, as well as the lane position, using the left analog stick. A quick tap of the X button at the starting gate will give you a good jump off the line, and near the end of the race you'll be prompted to hit the X button in order to use the riding crop. Both of these actions are timing based, though they're also fairly forgiving. Mostly what you have to worry about is riding your horse too hard. There's a stamina meter that you'll have to keep an eye on, though often it's possible to ride full tilt for the entire race and still have stamina to spare. The other danger in riding your horse too hard is injury, though this happens only in the game's career mode, and even then it's always possible to recover with a little R&amp;R. The whole jockey experience here just ends up feeling really simple and not particularly challenging.     The wagering in Breeders' Cup features much more depth and, in turn, is much more engaging than actually racing the horses. A day at the races is a mode that lets you spend a full eight-race day at one of the game's 15 real-world tracks putting money on the ponies. You're given a view of the virtual paddock before each race, which serves as a more colorful racing form, giving you access to details like the horse's parents, the win percentages of the jockey, and the horse's lifetime performance--including a breakdown of performance on both dirt and turf tracks. Whether you're able to digest any of this information into something meaningful, or you simply pick the horse with the funniest name, your next step is to place your bet. The betting system lets you place bets anywhere from $2 to thousands of dollars, and you can place standard win, place, and show bets, as well as more involved bets like daily doubles, exacta, trifecta, and pick three. Once you've placed your bet, you can choose to watch the race play out, or you can cut to the chase and just see who won. Your winnings in this mode can carry from one day to another, allowing you to rack up a massive bankroll, but the winnings can't be transferred to any of the other modes, and there's no real reward for your wins, leaving this mode feeling more than a little futile.     The career mode wraps up all three disciplines in a single package. Here you're given a stable where you can house up to six horses, train them, race them, and wager on them. You start off with just one horse, and you can acquire additional horses by breeding someone else's horses for a fee, though there's no option to put your own horses out to stud. The passage of time is defined by weekly races, in which you can choose to enter any of your eligible horses, and in between races you can adjust your horse's training regimen. Though each of the eight training options can help develop different characteristics in your horses, what you really need to look out for here is fatigue, because not only is a horse that's fatigued less likely to perform well on the track, it's also more likely to get injured. It's all quite streamlined, and it's easy to burn through the weeks, but the pacing of this mode ends up being extremely tedious, because you can't just jump to the races that you have horses in. If you have only one horse participating that day, and it's in the eighth race, you still have to skip past the first seven races to get there. It's especially irritating when you decide to take a week off from competing entirely.     The game's plain visuals don't make the proceedings more enticing, either. To its credit, the game does a fair job of capturing the look and feel of the real-world racetracks, though lots of muddled textures and an overall chunky look take away from the effect. The riders and horses are similarly simplistic in design. Every horse in the game shares the exact same running animation, which isn't particularly smooth and can be downright stuttery when turning corners. You can expect some amateurish rain and fog effects, which often have as much of an effect on the frame rate as they do on the atmosphere.          The presence of renowned race caller Tom Durkin as the announcer could have been a great boon for NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships, but instead, any of Tom Durkin's ability to bring drama or excitement to the races is cut down by shoddy sound design. All of the calls are obviously patched together, and the cadence from one phrase to the next almost never matches up, giving the game a real unnatural, lurching pace. There's some good grandstand noise, and when you're in the stables or the paddock you can hear nice ambient country sounds, but otherwise the aural presentation is awkward and synthetic. In addition to all these faults, NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships is exceptionally buggy for a PlayStation 2 game. We experienced sound bugs where Tom Durkin would repeat the same three-second loop for the entire race, and bugs where the game would just lock up entirely, sometimes filling the screen with lots of nasty debug code.      NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships is a pretty lean package that sees itself competing with some long-running, well-established franchises in an extremely niche market. Those put off by the searing difficulty levels of Koei's and Tecmo's horseracing franchises may find some comfort in the more casual gait of Breeders' Cup, but ultimately the whole experience is hobbled by its clumsy interface and patchy presentation.    "
1001,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,7.0,2,"Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is every bit as fantastical as you'd hope, an RPG set in a massive world where man and animal live on the backs of tremendous beasts in a sea of clouds. The world of Alrest, simultaneously Earthly and alien, with a mysterious history that even its major players fail to truly understand, is a magical place to inhabit. It appropriately sets the stage for an epic adventure that gets more interesting as it develops, but this greatness comes after dozens of hours filled with eye rolls and bewilderment. For all the good things Xenoblade 2 eventually introduces, the 80-plus hours it takes to complete the story won't feel like time wasted, but the bad taste of the its lesser qualities is never completely washed away.The cliched hero Rex is a naive and upbeat salvager who gets wrapped up in contract work with the game's soon-to-be villains at the start. They seek a legendary sword, which in this case is the weapon-manifestation of a human-like being known as a Blade. When a human resonates with a Blade, as Rex does with his objective, Pyra, a lifelong partnership forms. Though sentimental to a point, these bonds are also a bit lopsided as Blades are forever bound to serve their masters. Xenoblade 2 does address this as the story unravels, one of the few smart instances when the game puts itself to task. Rex doesn't quite enjoy the same full-circle maturation, sadly, though his positivity at least grows more welcome as stakes rise and other characters' outlooks sour.Anyone familiar with Xenoblade Chronicles will rightfully recognize the way Xenoblade 2 sets you up to be surprised in the end, as characters gradually reveal secret thoughts, unveil unexpected backstories, and make moves that catch you off guard. These thought-provoking revelations reshape your understanding of the world and the point of your participation. But long before the story delivers these compelling beats, you are thrust into predictable scenarios and presented with poorly voiced characters from one scene to the next. Once again, the stout and furry Nopon creatures are an annoyance on par with Jar Jar Binks, harming would-be dramatic scenes the moment they open their mouths.Rex and Pyra seek Elysium, a sort of paradise atop a towering tree running through the center of Alrest. They partner with a small selection of comrades from different walks of life who surprisingly have more in common than they initially realize. You can only ever travel as a party of three, but with a Blade standing behind each character, or Driver, battles are frenzied displays. Still, Xenoblade 2 gives you a chance to breathe and strategize during its real-time bouts. Every character will dish out basic attacks automatically, which in turn fuel more advanced skills. You only ever have complete control over one character, but your allies will chime in with requests to perform certain moves. How you manage this process, and the numerous other battle mechanics, can make or break your success against the game's tougher enemies.One of the major issues with Xenoblade 2 is that it fails to adequately educate you, with fly-by tutorials introducing cascading mechanics and terminology that's easy to mix up. The flow of combat works as follows: your auto attacks fill up a meter tied to abilities known as arts, arts fuel another meter for special attacks, special attacks can be linked from one character to the next to build up a Blade combo, Blade combos seal away certain enemy abilities, and team chain attacks--based on a meter that is also used to revive fallen teammates--can break these seals to create an elemental explosion that deals hefty damage, which successfully extends the chain attack for another round. Enemies can also be forced into tiers of vulnerability by breaking their defense, toppling them to the ground, launching them into the air, and smashing them back down, provided you execute these moves with abilities linked to cooldowns that you've hopefully kept track of, all before countdown timers close your window of opportunity. There are other systems that exist on a per-character basis, but those exclusions notwithstanding, there's already a lot to keep track of. Success comes from managing timers and meter charges and firmly grasping your available options, the latter of which is more demanding than the game initially lets on.Thankfully Xenoblade 2 feels appropriately balanced to account for its learning curve. It's not until later in the game that mastery becomes paramount. The frustration arises, however, from the lack of reference material, which makes your desire to improve, or your ability to chase hidden paths with dangerous enemies and great rewards, difficult to realize at first. Take screenshots when the game presents you with a tutorial, because once you move to the next text bubble, that info is otherwise lost. The only other recourse is to purchase bite-sized tips from informants throughout the game, though linking partial tutorials to a merchant is hardly user-friendly, and they don't adequately cover the breadth of Xenoblade 2's mechanics.Merchants in general even manage to be confusing at first, as one location will cram as many as a dozen in a small area. Characters can carry items in special pouches that buff certain stats, such as meter generation, and while some are incredibly useful to the point of eliminating the need to grind, it's a slow process to familiarize yourself with the dozens of options available to you, and the numerous merchants that specialize in one category apiece. This also extends to a vast selection of accessories for characters and Blades, which are difficult to keep track of and compare given the game's mediocre item-management interface. Variety is good, but Xenoblade 2 throws you into the deep end a bit too early for you to appreciate the value of everything at your disposal.To build a formidable team, you're encouraged to regularly acquire new Blades by collecting and bonding with Core Crystals, which are found in chests and dropped by defeated enemies. Despite three tiers of crystals--normal, rare, and legendary--you're never guaranteed to get one of the game's elusive rare Blades from crystals you find in the field. Save for a few varying body types, the vast majority of Blades you acquire also look nearly identical.Looks obviously aren't everything, and even common Blades are useful as they each come with randomized buffs and stat bonuses that can make a big difference in battle. But rare Blades have unique designs, their own side quests, and a larger selection of skills and stat bonuses than common Blades. It's easy enough over time to fill out your party with rares, but opening Core Crystals becomes less attractive as diminishing returns set in. Opening 50 towards the end of the game yielded zero rare Blades, despite having unlocked only half of the rare roster.To combat the randomness of Core Crystals, you are joined by a Blade early on named Poppi, an artificial lifeform that you can customize to your liking. The concept sounds great, but unlocking parts to modify Poppi requires you to play a shallow retro game called Tiger Tiger, where you move a chunky character through a slow-scrolling stage while picking up collectables. More annoyingly, you can't play this game freely, and must return to an early-game location and likely play a couple hundred rounds to earn enough resources for desirable upgrades. This long-winded process isn't enjoyable enough to see through, and not worth sidelining your efforts elsewhere with Blades that you can raise organically through combat.Blades outside of your core party can also be trained via asynchronous mercenary missions, and they return after a fixed amount of time with rewards and experience that goes towards developing their secondary abilities. Field skills, for example--traits such as lockpicking, focus, and leaping power--will allow you to access elite treasure chests and shortcuts. There are very rare instances when the game will gate you with a door that requires mastery of certain field skills, though these are exclusively linked to abilities shared among story-based Blades.Even in these situations, you're never truly stuck. Xenoblade 2 lets you fast travel, instantly, to any major location in the game, regardless of the context in the story. This is great in a pinch, but it's also incredibly illogical. You shouldn't be able to warp out of a location to buy equipment across the world during a mission where your main objective is to escape imprisonment, but Xenoblade 2 affords you that option. No matter how silly it seems in practice, fast travelling makes it easy to hop back and forth from one incredible environment to the next. Alrest is gigantic, and following the story will only reveal a small part of what there is to see. Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X both set a high bar for world design, and developer Monolith Soft. has once again delivered a robust collection of dazzling environments.On this and many other levels, Xenoblade 2 exhibits admirable depth. Adventurous types that enjoy complex combat systems can easily spend more than 100 hours uncovering Alrest's secrets and developing their team of Blades, provided they can come to terms with a handful of unavoidable shortcomings. It's equal parts pleasing and frustrating, but the struggle to keep up with everything thrown your way is more of a hurdle than a roadblock. It will be a tough pill to swallow for people who aren't accustomed to the typical cliches found in many Japanese RPGs, and its often clumsy nature keeps it from being the next groundbreaking Switch game, but Xenoblade 2 is worth pursuing if you've got enough patience to let it blossom."
76,Storyteller,4.0,0,"The premise of Storyteller is simple yet tantalizing: You create stories that yield a certain outcome by altering the order in which key events occur. You do this by filling in boxes that resemble comic strip panels, using an established list of characters and settings to do so. As you structure your story, adjusting variables where needed in order to create the ending needed to pass the level, the panels interact with each other, resulting in a sort of interactive butterfly effect.The challenges start off simple enough--make the prince and princess fall in love, help the knight slay the monster, etc.--then quickly become a bit more complex, requiring you to understand a certain character's temperament and how that may flavor their interactions with others. For example, the noble knight is wary of murdering another character. The bloodthirsty baron, on the other hand, will leap at the opportunity. Similarly, the knight will always vie for the queen's affection, though it remains up to you to get her to feel the same towards him.Simplicity is the heart of Storyteller--for better and for worse. The game's mechanics are easy to understand and make for a breezy experience, and its muted, cartoony-yet-minimalistic artwork is charming. Its simplicity also makes for an experience that suits portable consoles well, as it's easy to pick up and play a few puzzles while on the go.But while its premise is inspired, Storyteller suffers from feeling overly simple. At nearly 30 minutes into the game's hour-long runtime, it already begins to feel empty and far too small--too small for creativity, too small to provide a sense of challenge, and too small to create an engaging experience. You quickly discover there are very few variables and characters you can interact with, and they are frequently repeated throughout levels. This means once you're halfway through the game, you'll have no new puzzle pieces to ponder over or to attempt to squeeze into their proper place. And, once you have a grasp on how these variables interact with each other, each level feels less like a puzzle and more like a quick exercise of tossing things into place in order to move forward.At times, the game begins to feel downright tedious, as you are no longer solving puzzles but merely arranging very obvious sequences of events. One puzzle, for example, tasked me with establishing several different characters as related by having them say, ""I am your parent"" to other characters. There was no challenge to it, just the frustration of having to create several panels with the same sentence spoken by different characters to establish this lineage and some affection for each other. Regardless, and with the exception of one level that took me slightly longer than usual to figure out, I was able to absent-mindedly breeze through the entire experience, which fails to provide the sense of satisfaction you want from a puzzle game.Even the handful of optional objectives scattered throughout its levels don't add much complexity to the game, as they often task you with just tweaking a couple things to get a slightly different result. These challenges often included things like completing a story in a certain number of frames or without using a particular character, yet are so simple you can generally knock them out the first time you solve the puzzle. Sure, it was cute enough to see some of these differences play out, but it also made me wish the game offered more room for creativity--a larger bank of variables to play around with and more options on how to reach a level's end goal.Storyteller is frustrating in that it never feels as if you are truly solving a puzzle or creating a story of your own. Rather, you are trying to piece together the exact story the game expects from you. While there are a few levels where you can attain a satisfactory ending multiple ways, these feel few and far between. Ultimately, all these issues stifle the experience, reducing it to a creative concept that doesn't feel fulfilled. This also eliminates any replayability the game might have, as once you play a level, there's no benefit to trying to find a different solution and achieve a new outcome.As someone who loves fairy tales and has sunk quite a few hours into creative puzzle games like Scribblenauts, I was delighted by the prospect of playing Storyteller. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. While its concept is interesting, the game ultimately feels confined--held back by simple puzzles and its lack of creative freedom."
361,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,9.0,2,"Update (March 25, 2020): Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a capable game on PS4 and Xbox One, running at variable resolutions while keeping that locked 60fps experience intact. It was hard for me to visualize what exactly developer Vicarious Visions could do aside from bumping up the resolution on the new generation of consoles, but after playing both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, it's clear the remake has some improvements that, while not drastic changes to the already incredible game, are undeniably impactful.THPS 1+2 on the new consoles offers two different display modes: Fidelity and Performance. Both modes feature improved shadows and lighting, which makes already beautiful stages like School and Venice Beach look even more impressive. Fidelity kicks the resolution on both consoles up to native 4K while retaining that buttery smooth 60fps; Performance, on the other hand, drops the resolution to 1080p but targets 120fps. On Xbox Series X, Performance mode feels even smoother and more responsive than the already pristine Fidelity mode. The speed of the high frame rate makes an already exciting game more exhilarating, comparable with the fantastic PC version. And thanks to the Xbox's support for FreeSync and HDMI 2.1's VRR, the variable frame rate is smoothed out, providing the best experience on consoles.Because the PS5 doesn't support any adaptive sync technology, Performance mode's variable frame rate is much more apparent on the console, which means gameplay is plagued with frame rate inconsistency. For a game that requires responsive controls and a consistent frame rate, this is detrimental to the overall experience--I found myself dropping combos on the PS5 that I could easily finish on Xbox Series X. The PS5's lack of VRR support is frustrating, as it's the only thing standing in the way of Performance mode shining. Regardless, the Fidelity mode still provides excellent visuals and a solid frame rate. And both consoles show improved load times over their last-gen counterparts.The PS5's DualSense controller also provides some gameplay additions. THPS 1+2 utilizes the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to provide enhanced rumble. The subtle rumble of your skateboard as you manual across the concrete evokes the real-life feeling of your wheels gliding across the blacktop. And when performing a revert, you'll notice a slight resistance, with your triggers locking up completely if you bail. The haptic feedback is an immensely pleasurable feature, but the adaptive triggers were distracting and an impediment to my high score--turning them off made me feel more comfortable stringing together combos.It's no surprise that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is still a spectacular game. The near-perfect recreation of two of gaming's most beloved titles has been improved upon in some smart ways, utilizing the power of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X to push the image quality, resolution, and frame rate to new heights. And if the PS5 ever gets an update to add VRR support, the Performance mode will shine just as bright as it does on the Xbox Series X. - Mat Paget | The original review, first published on September 3, 2020, continues below.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 captures that nearly perfectly.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 revamps the levels and skaters of the first two games, though it borrows many aspects from later titles as well. While the trick system's foundation stuck through the entire series' history, various trick types were added with each new release. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 features many of the best ones, including reverts and spine transfers, and thankfully, it doesn't stray further than Underground's wallplants and grind/manual transitions. This makes 1 + 2's trick system feel complete, neglecting the less crucial mechanics--like Freak Out from Underground 2--and focusing on the best aspects of the series' tricks. One very nice touch, however, lets you switch between the revamped trick system and the first and second game's trick systems, offering a more authentic experience akin to the originals.No matter which trick system you go with, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 plays fantastically. While you still control it the exact same way you would the originals, it feels a lot less stiff. Tricks are as exciting to pull off as they've ever been, but the speed of the game moves faster and the skaters' animations are a lot more fluid. Transitioning from grab tricks and spins into a string of manuals and then finishing with a set of grind transitions feels incredible--it evokes the series' early days of nailing unrealistic and goofy combos, while also remaining engaging and exciting when you're checking off goals in 2020.Levels have received makeovers, and each one looks absolutely stunning. Whether you're skating on Venice Beach or bombing it through the dilapidated Mall, it's quite shocking to see these classic stages with much more detail--and with much less fog than on the original PlayStation. The sunset on Venice Beach hits with vibrant oranges and reds that give a whole new mood to the oceanside level, while the Mall is overgrown with plants and plywood-barricaded stores; it almost looks post-apocalyptic. I never saw the Mall as abandoned or even run-down, but this new take--along with many other new looks--afforded by an increase in details makes it feel like you're experiencing a brand-new level, even if the layout is the same.Some stages feature subtle new touches such as drones filming you in Downhill Jam or a stray cat running in the background of Warehouse. These small details breathe life into levels that felt lonely and lifeless in their original releases. It's really quite charming. However, loading into some of the parks can take a considerable amount of time--starting up Streets, San Francisco, for the first time made me think the game had crashed. Restarting your run (something you'll likely do a lot of) can also take up to five seconds in some instances. The original games were quite snappy, and you were able to restart your run quickly if you weren't happy with how your session was going. Five seconds isn't a big deal and didn't impede my enjoyment too much, but when the rest of the game nails the THPS experience, it's hard not to notice the smallest of divergences.Pro Skater 1 + 2 also sees the addition of collectible stat points. These were introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Prior to that game, you would collect cash hidden throughout each level and spend it on upgrading your skater. Original developer Neversoft did a great job hiding this cash throughout each level, encouraging you to explore every nook and perform tricks on every cranny. Pro Skater 1 + 2's stat points miss the mark since you don't have to explore an entire level to collect everything. Because the levels are so well designed, it's disappointing to see that covering the entire map isn't required to complete every goal.Many of the original games' goals are present, with a few added to beef up the meager THPS1 checklists. Among other things, these goals task you with collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, performing specific tricks at specific spots, and causing general mayhem--for example, destroying cop cars or draining public fountains. Once you complete a goal, it's completed for every skater. In the original games, each skater had their own career to play through, giving you the option to complete all of the goals with every playable skater. Once I finished my first playthrough with Rodney Mullen, I started up a playthrough with Leticia Bufoni only to find that all of the goals had already been completed. I can still play through every level to collect her stat points, but it can feel oddly empty without these objectives.That said, you're not left without stuff to do once you've finished your first playthrough. THPS 1 + 2 introduces a whole slate of challenges that have you completing specific feats with each skater on each park. These include performing different kinds of combos, doing specific things on specific levels, and various other tasks. While a challenge isn't your typical Tony Hawk goal, they do add a layer of objectives that are well worth taking on--and there are a lot of them. Some of these challenges are pretty tough, too, which makes it particularly rewarding when you start ticking them off. THPS's core mechanics are engaging enough to be the sole reason you play, but these challenges give you compelling new goals to chase as you extend combos and try to best your top scores.Completing challenges also rewards you with new decks, gear, and other items in addition to money and XP, which can unlock even more gear. The real professional skaters featured in the game have specific clothing and decks you can unlock, while all of the purchased and unlocked items can be equipped to your created skaters. There are no signs of real-money microtransactions; instead, you'll need to rely on completing challenges to accrue more in-game cash. This feels fair, and aside from some visual flair, there is no effect on your points, combos, or anything else. It's all about making your created skater look cool, which is easy to do with the wide selection of gear, from punk-oriented threads to the most stylish drip (plus a well-crafted character creator that offers a good variety of options).The soundtrack also boasts music fit for a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game. Many of the original tracks return for 1 + 2, but a lot of new music is also included. These all fit in with the rest of the tracks, and if it wasn't for their respective release dates, it's easy to imagine them on the original soundtracks. It's an eclectic mix of hip hop and punk, with impeccable inclusions like ""Can I Kick It?"" by A Tribe Called Quest, ""She's Famous Now"" by Reel Big Fish, and ""Shutdown"" by Skepta. The music also reacts to your gameplay, adding a subtle reverb when you fill your special meter and a slight muffle when you bail. It's a well-used soundtrack that reminds me of why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is remembered for its music as much as its mechanics.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 also comes with some multiplayer features, including Create-a-Park and various versus modes. Create-a-Park lets you do exactly as it says, and it's a pretty extensive and easy-to-use tool for creating your own levels. You have to unlock cosmetic parts for your custom parks through challenges, but you get all of the necessities by default, which is enough to create a playable and entertaining park. Sharing levels with other players is also possible, and there are already a number of custom parks that show off both quality and silliness. Because you can share your maps, it's a far more enjoyable mode than it ever was in its early days, and I'm really excited to see what a potential community creates.As for its multiplayer, THPS 1 + 2 offers both local and online versus modes. A lot of the game types take after the original games' multiplayer, with modes like Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Tag as well as new ones like Combo Mambo and Score Challenge. Horse, one of the all-time best modes, also returns, and while it's mostly a great time, some infrequent frame dropping can occur. It's a bit surprising, since you just take turns trying to outdo your friend's score and it doesn't feel particularly demanding. Even more surprising is the fact that the split-screen modes don't come with these performance issues. The online multiplayer, on the other hand, runs very well as it rotates through various modes in a lobby--it’s an exciting way to hang out with friends, skate, and compete for the highest score.Because it nails so much about that original Tony Hawk experience, it's really hard to be mad at Pro Skater 1 + 2 for any of its downsides. The load times aren't enough to keep you away from the plethora of satisfying combos, and the lack of level goals for every skater isn't enough to keep you from jumping back in with a new character. Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable, and that on its own is enough to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a success. However, smart additions and an engaging challenge system make it an experience that's more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk's past."
4248,Rally Challenge 2000,4.0,0,"South Peak Interactive's Rally Challenge 2000 is, at best, a marginal attempt to bring the excitement of off-road rally racing to the Nintendo 64. The developer, Imagineer, made an honest attempt with this game, but came up a little short of success. While the game offers a fair amount of options, the depth just isn't there, and only the most hard-core rally fans will have a lasting interest in it. RC 2000 offers a total of nine different cars, all with varying levels of torque, speed, and steering. While it sounds like these different attributes would make the cars control differently, the vehicles ultimately end up being virtually the same in the arcade mode, with the only major difference between them being the body styles and decals. In terms of control, the layout is simple and effective, and it only takes a moment to get used to. The overall response time leaves a little bit to be desired and doesn't make you feel as though you're actually driving - the game is more akin to a kart racing game in this respect. Even gently nudging a wall or letting off the accelerator will bring you to a dead stop in seconds flat. Braking, for the most part, is not even needed to do well in the game. A feature that gets points for accuracy, but is rather annoying, is the announcer. In real rally events, the drivers' teammates call out upcoming turns to keep the drivers aware of what is coming. In RC 2000, the announcer provides this service. This feature is helpful for the first couple of times you race, but it gets very repetitive after you've become familiar with the tracks.  The game does have a decent number of play modes - arcade, championship, practice, and the party favorite, versus. Arcade mode lets you choose from any of the game's nine cars and runs you through a series of three tracks and three levels of difficulty. Unfortunately, there are no additional cars or tracks to unlock, so after you've finished the arcade mode, you've really seen all there is to offer. Championship mode is a little more in-depth and lets you adjust your car's suspension, gear ratios, tires, and steering. The goal of this mode is to amass the most points over the course of nine races. Being able to have some level of control over your vehicle's characteristics really gives you an advantage and adds to the replay value. Versus mode is by far the most entertaining feature of the game. In this mode, you can race up to four players simultaneously, much like Mario Kart 64, but in a slightly more realistic setting. Better still is the fact that the announcer is not present in this mode. As with a great deal of four-player games, the frame rate drops off considerably, but the drop doesn't really take away from the overall feel of the game. In closing, RC 2000 is a decent arcade-style racing game, but the lack of additional cars and tracks to unlock, coupled with unrealistic controls, makes it hard for any gamer looking for an accurate simulation of rally racing to take this game seriously. Many will enjoy the four-player versus mode and take little notice of the cut in performance. Rally Challenge succeeds on some levels and fails on others, but on the whole, it does a good job of being a party game."
200,Diablo Immortal,6.0,1,"There is little to question that Diablo Immortal is a big and richly produced Diablo entry. It looks great, it evolves the formula of action role-playing introduced in Diablo III and matches it acutely to the hardware it was originally designed for, and it strikes a good balance of making you feel powerful while also enticing you to continue hunting down better loot. In that sense, Diablo Immortal is just another good Diablo game, but it's also one that can't always be played with the same obsessive cadence as prior titles given the number of barriers that can routinely force some time away from it.The story takes place between Diablo II and III, with familiar faces popping up to provide some thin context for events that have transpired by the time you arrive in Tristram at the start of the last core title. Deckard Cain is back (why wouldn't he be?) and so is a new evil that is threatening to use shards of the same Worldstone to wreak havoc across the lands. Story conversations are fully voiced, which makes Immortal feel as premium as previous Diablo titles on PC. There's really nothing here that suggests it's anything less than that either, with large open spaces for you to explore and numerous side quests to undertake as you progress the story.What is different is obviously where you'll be playing. Diablo Immortal was designed for smartphones, and it's unsurprising then that it plays best on them, too. The touch controls employ the familiar digital analog stick on the left side of the screen, while the right features a cluster of buttons for your various abilities. You have a single main attack along with four equippable skills to choose from, with a fifth ultimate ability button appearing once you have access to it. It's simple and well-spaced out, and I never found myself accidentally pressing any skills I didn't want to. You can move and have attacks target enemies automatically, which simplifies your focus further, but also helps you accurately aim certain skills that require it. With my Necromancer, I often need to choose the area in which I want to explode a bunch of corpses, which is easily done by just holding down the skill in question and rotating my finger to position it. In a chaotic fight where I needed to pull this off fast, the accuracy could be a little wonky, but these moments were mostly fleeting.Diablo Immortal also supports a variety of controllers that you can pair using Bluetooth, and here the action becomes even more manageable. With a physical stick, movement is more natural and mapping abilities to buttons and triggers meant it was even rarer for mistakes to crop up. Better yet, the right stick can be used to aim abilities, removing the need to have a single tap perform double duty. Still, it wasn't as significant a difference that I found myself always ensuring I had a controller on hand if I wanted to play Diablo Immortal on the go.Diablo Immortal is also supported on PC, albeit under an ""open beta"" banner that is well-deserved. The game on PC is disappointing to say the least, missing many basic features expected of a PC game that make it a far worse way to play the game. While many of the game's visual settings can still be toggled on and off from the mobile versions, including levels of detail and maximum frame rates, the PC version can only be played at 1080p. Though it's still the most popular resolution amongst PC players, it's unacceptable to have a PC version out that doesn't let you change this setting, making UI elements and text look blown out and blurry at anything other than its native resolution. It's clear, at this time at least, that Diablo Immortal was developed primarily for mobile, and thus you should probably stick to playing it there.Gameplay has been tweaked to accommodate the move to mobile, too, simplifying the formula from Diablo III even further. No matter which of the five classes you pick, Immortal won't burden you with managing mana or stamina to use abilities, instead just relying on cooldowns to balance things out. Each ability also only has a single upgrade path, removing the options that Diablo III gave you to change up their effects. This ultimately gives you a lot less to worry about, but also fewer options to tweak your build using just your abilities alone. Legendary gems that you start acquiring later in the game do augment existing abilities while completely changing others, giving you some flexibility that will be required if you aim to challenge the game's more grueling content once you've hit its level cap of 60.Initially, the story itself provides enough momentum to carry you through your movement between Diablo Immortal's several hub areas, each of which has a level associated with it to describe its challenge. The structure of how you move between these areas differs slightly from the stringent act-based progression of previous games, but it ties in well with the more MMO-like nature of gameplay. After the brief introduction, your world is populated by a host of other players, letting you tackle dynamic events and bounties together. Other players will seamlessly join and leave your screen space as they see fit, not requiring you to actively party up in order to work towards the same objective (although the ability to do so does exist). You can complete Diablo Immortal's story entirely alone if you wish, with only endgame activities requiring you to start finding a large group of players to raid with.Each story act is usually bookended by a dungeon, which can be completed alone or with up to three other players via matchmaking. These are packed with creatures to kill and climactic boss battles that are a visual spectacle, while also providing significant loot rewards on completion. This mission can be replayed infinitely with higher difficulty modifiers to increase both the challenge and reward, while also providing a good amount of experience to supplement traditional progression. These, along with daily bounties, codex missions, and other side missions, are somewhat required after level 30 when core story progression grinds to a halt. Missions start requiring you to be a certain level to play them, while later game areas will have monsters far beyond your capabilities should you venture to them without the requisite gear and offensive power.These small roadblocks will remind you Diablo Immortal is still a free-to-play mobile game, and its structure has been designed around the idea of frequent daily check-ins instead of instantly gratifying long play sessions. It enforces a grind that prevents you from continuing on with the story if that's your primary focus, pushing you towards completing daily bounties, a variety of side missions buried in an assortment of menus that are specific to both your character and each of the areas you visit, as well as progression smaller side stories. None of these are as engaging as the main campaign, especially when most boil down to traveling to previous locations and killing a number of enemies you've already killed hundreds of. The paid version of the battle pass offers more experience bonuses if you choose to purchase it, which would speed this process up significantly, so the temptation to pay to bypass the roteness always feels present when you're booting up the game and being reminded of the tasks that await. Still, if you're adamant not to spend a cent, these hindrances might only delay your progress by a day at most, allowing you to grab new bounties and their associated rewards in order to progress.Where Diablo Immortal's microtransactions start becoming more troublesome is in its late-game content, and especially so once you've seen out the main story. Progression slows significantly from here, which impacts your ability to continue to subsequent playthroughs and increases your endgame paragon level. PvP play is also heavily reliant on some of the best gear and stat-altering gems that the game has to offer, the latter of which can be purchased through a marketplace that accepts an in-game currency that you can buy with real-world money (unlike Diablo III's original Auction House, however, sales cannot be converted back to real money).Random loot boxes work into the equation too, although Diablo Immortal eschews the actual mechanics of this into something slightly more interactive. Elder Rifts, like those introduced with Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, generate random dungeons with enemies and a boss for a brief, enjoyable loot rush. Immortal changes this formula slightly with crests, of which different types let you ensure the base rarity of items you'll be rewarded with. In a way, Elder Rifts are Immortal's form of loot boxes, with the odds of good loot depending on how many crests you're willing to burn on each run.Crests can be earned through play, but later start becoming scarcer. You can purchase two regular crests a day using in-game gold that you earn through play, but only one legendary crest a month through the same process. It's the legendary crests that are most valuable, however, ensuring that you'll receive a new Legendary Gem during a rift one, while regular crests are only assured to drop Runes (which help you craft these same gems). These Legendary Gems act as modifiers to your core abilities, making them stronger or changing their effects entirely in some cases. While offering more flexibility in your builds, they're also crucial to endgame play, especially if you're planning to get invested in PvP. If you're looking to play beyond the story and increase your paragon level, Legendary Gems are some of the only ways to empower your character sufficiently, too, placing a reliance on them that makes traditional grinding feel increasingly slow when chasing them. It's clear from this balance that players choosing to pay for more crests or those purchasing them off the in-game marketplace are at an advantage, as you'll not be able to keep up otherwise.Late-game loot progression, legendary gems, and Elder Rift runs all matter if you're planning to play Diablo Immortal for a long time and invest in its incoming seasons and paragon progression. And you might be tempted to stick around, given how enjoyable the core campaign is. It's a classic Diablo experience, letting you gleefully watch all your stats increase as hordes of monsters melt in front of you. The power trip it enables sits up there with some of the best the series has to offer, which makes the sudden halt in pace jarring and off-putting. But it's still one that you can enjoy without needing to dive into the mess of menus and lists asking you to tap a button to claim a myriad of rewards day in and day out, given you're comfortable with not being able to power through it all in just a handful of sittings."
2497,LittleBigPlanet Karting,7.0,2,"       Almost every item doubles as an offensive attack and a defensive shield, which is both a blessing and a curse. Hitting an enemy with an offensive strike means you can move up one spot in the rankings, but if you're the recipient of such aggression, you can drop from first to sixth place (or worse) in the blink of an eye. Because of how punishing Karting is to those who are attacked, it's smarter to hang on to your item if you're in the top half of the group. That way, you can defend yourself from your devious opponents, and you can still gain position by sliding through turns with speed and power. It's an unfortunate balance that favors the cautious. Weapons often add a layer of volatility in kart racers, but here the balance is shifted so strongly to the defensive side that much of that anything-goes mentality has been evaporated.         The myriad quirks lessen the appeal of the go-karting action, though excellent track design keeps you focused on the road ahead. Shortcuts abound for those with eagle vision, so there's a learning curve while you figure out which line is best for your abilities. Collectibles litter courses, giving you small objectives while racing that keep you invested in the action. Point bubbles are merely for leaderboard rankings (though snagging a group in a perfect powerslide is eminently enjoyable), so the real prizes are the presents hidden in out-of-the-way places. These provide stickers, kart parts, and other tools in the editor, so it's well worth exploring the breadth of these cleverly designed courses to nab every package.           "
2739,Lumines: Electronic Symphony,8.0,2,"Lumines is still a must-have game for the system. Its uncomplicated Tetris-style gameplay makes it fun to play for both short and extended periods of time, and its stylish presentation still serves as something of a showpiece for what the aging handheld has to offer. Now, Lumines: Electronic Symphony has been released alongside the PlayStation Vita, and while it isn't nearly as new and exciting as the first game was, it makes some noticeable improvements to the formula and might very well be the one Vita launch game that you're still playing a year or two from now.        As in Lumines, your goal in Electronic Symphony is to rotate falling squares comprising four small blocks so that blocks of the same color join to form shapes measuring at least two by two. You move blocks with the D-pad and rotate them with face buttons, unless you're a masochist, in which case you can try to do everything with the relatively imprecise touch screen. These blocks don't disappear immediately, but rather when they're hit by the timeline--a vertical line that moves horizontally across the screen at varying speeds. This line, along with the fact that hanging blocks succumb to the pull of gravity, is what sets the game apart from other Tetris-style offerings. You have to pay attention to the timeline at all times, because as it sweeps from left to right it changes the landscape of the playing field that you're dropping squares onto. Mistime a drop by even a fraction of a second, and you might end up with a pile of mismatched squares instead of points.     The primary mode of play in Lumines: Electronic Symphony, titled Voyage, introduces new audio and visual themes (known as skins) as you progress. All of them look great, and the 30-plus tracks from the likes of The Chemical Brothers, LCD Soundsystem, Underworld, and Goldfrapp belong on your MP3 player if you have a penchant for electronic music. At first blush you could be forgiven for thinking that the skin changes are purely aesthetic; there are still only two different colors of blocks, and they still fall in the same square formations, after all. The skins' impact on gameplay quickly becomes apparent, though, when you realize that both the falling blocks and the timeline move at different speeds. Slow-falling squares combined with a speedy timeline means you have plenty of time to line up blocks that disappear almost as quickly as you can drop them. Conversely, fast-falling squares and a tardy timeline can quickly see the screen filling up as even blocks that you've matched linger for a time.     One of the great things about the never-ending Voyage mode is that, as you play, skins don't get more challenging in a linear fashion. They appear in the same order every time you play, but the action ebbs and flows in a satisfying way as challenging skins that make it tough to keep your screen clear are eventually followed by more forgiving ones that afford you an opportunity to clean up. Also helping your cause are a couple of special block types that show up occasionally.        Chain blocks cause all touching blocks of the same color to disappear the next time the timeline passes by, while shuffle blocks randomize the colors of every block in the formation that they touch--even if said formation fills almost the entire screen. Chain blocks are always a welcome sight because they provide a one-two punch on the playing field; drop one so that it connects with a long string of blocks of one color, and when those disappear you're left with a stack of the other color. Shuffle blocks can seem like a hindrance at times because they mess up areas that you feel you've organized in some fashion. They're easily disposed of if you leave an area clear to drop them into, though, and can save you in a pinch because dropping one often matches blocks that would otherwise remain mismatched and buried.     In addition to the chain and shuffle blocks that randomly appear in your squares, you can use the touch screen to trigger a special ability that recharges over time. These abilities are a welcome addition to the Lumines formula because they add an extra layer of strategy, and which of the several abilities you have at your disposal is determined by the avatar you choose to represent you onscreen. There are more than 40 different avatars to unlock either by leveling up as you play or by meeting with other players via the Vita's ""near"" sharing option, but only a handful of different single-player abilities. These include triggering the appearance of chain and shuffle blocks, changing your next three squares to all be single-color, slowing down the speed at which new squares appear, and pausing the timeline temporarily. When choosing an avatar, you also gain access to a multiplayer ability for use in Versus mode.     Where Lumines' Duel mode incorporated an option to play against the AI, Electronic Symphony requires an ad hoc opponent. If you're familiar with the versus play in Lumines, the new abilities are the only noteworthy thing that has changed. The screen is divided in half by a vertical line at the start of the game, and it moves to encroach on the playing area of the player who is losing. As in solo play, the game ends when one player no longer has any space to drop blocks into. Duel mode is frantic fun, and it's sadistically satisfying to hear your opponent groan when he realizes that you've used your ability to randomize the rotation of his blocks, to make one of his blocks near-invisible, or to send an unwanted shuffle block his way.        When you're not playing against a friend or putting a couple of hours into a Voyage session in an attempt to climb online leaderboards, options include timed modes that last for between 30 seconds and five minutes, a challenging Master mode, and custom playlists comprising a random or handpicked selection of skins from the 40-plus that can be unlocked. Since Voyage mode takes such a long time to play and always presents you with skins in the same order, playlists afford you a great way to mix things up and to limit the amount of time you spend playing. Master mode is also a good addition, since it doesn't take nearly as long to get difficult as Voyage.     The original game's Puzzle mode, in which you were challenged to create various shapes from the falling blocks, is unfortunately absent, but Lumines: Electronic Symphony is still very much a complete package. The asking price of $39.99 ($35.99 if you download it) might seem steep, but months from now when you're looking to enjoy 30 seconds or multiple hours at a time with your Vita, Lumines: Electronic Symphony will still have you covered.    "
124,Pentiment,6.0,1,"In Pentiment, you play as artist Andreas Maler, who is attempting to finish up his masterpiece while working for the Kiersau Abbey, which overlooks the Bavarian town of Tassing. A visiting baron draws the ire of both the farmers and craftspeople in town, as well as the Christian nuns and brothers of the abbey, but no one is prepared when he winds up dead. With Andreas' mentor--a man too old and feeble to have possibly overpowered the baron--pinned for the crime, the young illustrator vows to conduct his own private investigation in hopes of bringing the true culprit to justice. In doing so, Andreas is drawn into a strange conspiracy of cryptic notes and unspoken secrets, and his actions shape both Tassing and Kiersau Abbey in a story that spans a quarter of a century.Your actions have consequences in Pentiment. Most conversations can branch in a number of ways depending on the choices you pick, and Andreas' relationship with those around him is further shaped by the resulting consequences. Oftentimes, these consequences are felt immediately--a worried wife catching you in a lie might not offer information on her husband, for example--but there are quite a few with much longer-reaching effects. During the second act of Pentiment, the game kept telling me that choice after choice I was making would ""be remembered,"" but it wasn't until the final minutes of the act that the results of my actions were revealed. And in a twist of fate, my decision to repeatedly be nice to someone in the hours up to that point meant that they wouldn't abandon me during a dangerous situation.Pentiment often delights in these shocking outcomes in the latter half of its story, making for a far more exciting Act II and III in comparison to the rather meandering start. It certainly doesn't help that the moment-to-moment gameplay isn't all that exciting. Exploration is tediously slow, as fulfilling quests for folks can see you having to run from one side of Tassing to the other. Though Pentiment is depicted in a beautiful artistic style meant to emulate illuminated manuscripts and printed books of 16th-century Europe, the design of the world only changes between acts, and even then it's not by a substantial degree. Until the story starts getting interesting, there's not much to the experience beyond walking around and meeting people.Talking with characters to learn more about Tassing and the case you're trying to solve is a lot of fun, but the game frustratingly limits how much of that you can do. Each day is divided into sections, with slots of time reserved for working, praying, and eating. Longer conversations will take up all of your available time for any one slot, meaning you're unable to meet and talk to every single person over the course of your investigation.All Pentiment entails, however, is meeting with and getting to know the interesting characters or pursuing leads for the case at hand. That's the extent to which you interact with Pentiment's world. Putting a limit on how much of that you can do isn't inherently bad on its own--lots of visual novels and RPGs utilize something similar so players are encouraged to best use their time and get to know the characters they like more. But within the scope of a mystery, too much of a limitation gets in the way of the fun. You just can't dig enough into the people of Tassing within the confines allowed, leaving a lot of stones unturned when it's time to present your evidence.In theory, this system seems designed to push you to commit to one suspect, maybe two, and put any and all time you have into figuring out their motive. But many lines of investigation in Pentiment lead to clear realizations that the person you thought might be the killer is, in all likelihood, innocent, and all the time you spent considering them a suspect was for nothing. So if you commit to probing the wrong person, you're left with no time to scrutinize someone else upon realizing your mistake. But if you spread your investigation too thin, you might not have enough time to finish looking into anyone in depth. A system like this helps differentiate one playthrough from another, giving repeat playthroughs some variety, but it can make your first time through the game feel like you're being needlessly taxed for wanting to conduct a detailed examination of every available suspect. I'm also not a fan of the fact that grabbing dinner with someone can eat into your limited time as well, punishing you for wanting to learn more about the town and the characters unrelated to the case at hand.There's some fun to be had in how you approach situations at least. Early on, you construct Andreas' backstory--deciding what he studied in school, for instance. I opted for a man who had spent a bunch of time in Italy, had a knack for public speaking, the law, and the forbidden occult, and wanted to jump into the skirt of every woman in Tassing. And it was fun to have extra dialogue options that allowed me to flirt or talk about getting drunk in every other conversation or tell spooky ghost stories to the kids in town. And I used my knowledge of the law to aid the peasants in their troubles whenever I could. Pentiment goes a long way in rewarding the ways you shape Andreas, especially in how it allows you to get a better idea as to how people are feeling about what's going on in the world. I just wish the game had allowed me the space to interact this way with everyone instead of cutting me off from all but the few I had time to deeply engage with.As it takes place in the early 16th century, Pentiment sees you exploring a Bavaria that is undergoing a great religious and social transformation--Martin Luther is becoming a well-known name in Christian circles across Germany at this time, and more and more peasants are being taught to read. For a town like Tassing, built upon the ruins of Roman cities and with a history of druidic paganism, this has resulted in a great variety of people with different beliefs and morals, all striving to live together in relative peace.Pentiment makes this history quite approachable, even if you know very little about what was going on in Germany and the rest of Europe in the 1500s. At the push of a button, the game will pull back and detail any significant person, place, religion, or event mentioned in the conversation at hand, scribbled out like a student's notes in the margins of a reference book. It's never enough to bore, but just enough to give you an idea as to why something or someone is relevant. Thankfully, the system extends to the characters who live in Tassing and Kiersau Abbey as well--even featuring pictures of what they look like--so you can always know who folks are talking about.And you'll want to know who's who. The characters and their stories are the best part of Pentiment, whether it's watching them grow older and mature over the course of 25 years or witnessing how the ever-changing perception of religion and economic class influences the dynamics of a town. There's a lot of intriguing history to learn and witness within Pentiment's story, especially as the game delves into the events that--though memorable in hindsight--don't seem like anything more than a tragic series of misfortune at the moment.This, of course, lines up because there's an inherent tragedy to history, which is basically just a collection of stories, legends, and folklore about the past that those in the present do all they can to preserve as some semblance of truth, so as to inform the future and encourage new generations to be better. History is tragic because so much of it is pure malarkey--much of history is he said versus she said ad nauseam, an assortment of memorable hearsay that masks otherwise far more boring truths. It remembers the murderer but oftentimes glosses over the effects of the crime; it immortalizes the ideals of a revolution but too quickly forgets the initial cause and the cost. In the ever-ticking clock of history, the truth of what happened so quickly gives way to what people want to believe.This is the core narrative theme of Pentiment, playing out over the course of several decades as Andreas' choices influence the lives of those who inhabit the small town of Tassing and the nearby abbey. Regardless of how your investigation in Act I plays out, Andreas will return to Tassing years later in Act II to find much has changed. Even the most flimsy of reasonings years prior can pass into gospel over the course of years, and the accusations levied against the condemned will become truth accepted by all. Most fully believe that the person accused of killing the baron actually did it, and the ripples of that assumed truth have affected the lives of those who are left--some for better, and others for worse. And in the same way, your choices in Act II build into a perceived truth in Act III.The idea that history is but a series of causes and effects is not a particularly novel observation, culminating in a twist that--though earned--isn't all that interesting. It's left Pentiment as an intriguing conundrum for me. If you asked me whether I liked the story Pentiment told, my answer would be no, as you don't get to see the effects of the concluding revelation play out. And in a game where my choices matter in the moment-to-moment, I want to know how my handling of the final moment affects the lives of the few characters I got to know, if at all. And yet, despite my frustrations with how narratively unsatisfying the ending of Pentiment is, the game so clearly captures the essence of what history ultimately is within that final moment--a collection of tales and retellings so twisted together that there's really no definitive resolution for anyone. And I respect developer Obsidian Entertainment's commitment to remaining true to that.More than anything, I love the developer's commitment to stylized fonts throughout the game. Pentiment utilizes an assortment of fonts, with messy and curved letters used for the peasants' simpler way of speaking while something more highly stylized is used for those with an education. The brilliance in this style of characterization is best seen when a person's font changes. After Andreas learns that a simple farmer knows how to read, the farmer's letters are erased and rewritten in the more structured font of an educated, literate person, for example. It's such a fun and clever way of showcasing how men like Andreas judged people primarily on their station and appearance, but that perception could be changed on a dime upon learning whether or not someone is educated--one of the only times in any game I've played where I think literally spelling something out actually carries some intriguing narrative weight.There's not as much narrative complexity to the visual style of Pentiment, but it's striking all the same. The illustrated character models convey a great deal of detail and further carry the idea of history resembling a painting that an artist adds to over and over, with the underlying pentiment--the original image in a painting that reemerges when the top layer fades or is scrubbed away--occasionally shining through. The characters in Pentiment are just pictures being painted over again and again, and you could argue that they aren't even the original image, seeing as Tassing is built upon the ruins of the Romans. It's an interesting concept that Pentiment unfortunately only touches upon in snippets throughout its runtime, saving the intriguing questions posed in comparing history to a pentiment for the final moments of the third act. I wish it had pulled those elements to the forefront much sooner.As is, Pentiment strives to exist somewhere between a history book and historical fiction, not quite committing to a detailed look at history or fulfilling a narrative arc. This is a detriment to the game's conclusion, dampening my memories of the game save for the stories of individual characters. I retain a soft spot for the wise Illuminata and her conversations with Andreas about literature and religion, and I have a parental fondness for a young peasant girl who I watched grow from a gurgling toddler to a young woman. Witnessing their lives play out is a narrative delight, only enhanced by the creative use of Pentiment's different fonts to better convey a person's societal station or education. But limiting how much time the player actually has to engage in the game's best parts hurts the overall experience too much."
714,Zanki Zero: Last Beginning,6.0,1,"You certainly can't say that Zanki Zero: Last Beginning is not unique. How many other games out there are first-person, real-time, tile-based roguelike horror dungeon crawls featuring in-depth survival mechanics, ensemble character drama, and a post-apocalyptic sci-fi story about clones and the last remnants of humanity? I definitely can't think of any. But unique doesn't always equal good, and in the case of Zanki Zero, its interesting, genre-melding concepts wind up a bit hobbled by some not-so-great execution.Zanki Zero begins as a rogue's gallery of eight characters find themselves on a strange tropical island with only a few rundown facilities. They all have no idea why they're here, how they got there, or what connection they all have. But things soon take a turn for the even weirder: TVs across the island start playing a bizarre educational cartoon at set intervals, explaining that the eight are the last remnants of humanity and must work together to survive and build a new future for the human race. Oh, and they're all actually clones, experience rapid aging, and die after 13 days of life--assuming nothing else kills them first. But it's okay, because one of the few functioning things on the island is an Extend machine that can clone them after they die, effectively meaning they can live and die forever.And die they will, because survival in this dilapidated paradise is no picnic. When you begin the game, you barely have any functional facilities to do things like cook and sleep, and you need to collect material in order to build them. Not only that, but you need to effectively micromanage the health of every character. On top of a typical health meter, they also have a stamina meter (which drains from merely existing and goes down faster when doing strenuous activities or carrying lots of items), a stress meter, and even a bladder meter. Letting one element get out of control can have cascading effects; if a character can't hold it anymore and wets themselves, they become embarrassed and stressed, which makes fighting enemies tougher, which leads to more rapid stamina loss for them and their teammates, which leads to health loss, which leads to death. Scavenging and using food and relief items and facilities like toilets helps, but carrying too much leaves a character overburdened and unable to move, and as time passes, characters age, and the amount they can carry changes.If that all sounds like a lot to take in, that's because it really is. The heavy survival elements of Zanki Zero get dumped on you quite early in the game, and with little in the way of resources and experience, managing everything can get extremely rough. And that's all before you factor in exploration and combat. The game offers multiple difficulty levels (that can be changed mid-game to your liking) to help offset this, but it's still pretty rough waters in the early game as you try to come to grips with how much you need to micromanage. While there are some tutorials, they are inadequate, amounting to info-dumps that are tough to take in when you're already struggling with juggling everything else. Once you finally have all of the island's facilities built and can stock a small safety net of resources, the constant micromanagement becomes far less daunting and even quite enjoyable as you watch your ragtag bunch grow from helpless castaways to capable survivors.All those important survival elements aren't even the core focus of the game, either--it's also a first-person, real-time dungeon crawler. At the behest of the mysterious TV characters, the cast explores urban ruins that drift to the shores of the island to find new parts for their Extend machine and finally remove the fatal rapid-aging flaw from their cloned selves. Each of the ruins is tied to one or more of the cast members' lives, and you'll see glimpses of traumatic events from their pasts in each one that reveals more about who they are and, perhaps, why they are here. The unfolding story and revelations throughout the varied environments push you to move forward and discover the secrets of the characters' hellish situation. You won't get more story without a struggle, however; the ruins are laden with hazards like mutated animals and trap switches. If the challenge of basic survival and rapid old age doesn't kill you, the threats in the ruins certainly will.But character death can have its advantages. Sure, you have to drag them back to the Extend machine and spend your limited stash of “points” earned from dungeon exploration to revive them in a child body. But when you revive them, you can also give them a bonus called ""Shigabane:"": based on their life experiences and how they died, they get advantages in their new clone form. For example, dying at middle age from being gored by a giant boar while poisoned will result in the revived clone taking reduced damage from boars, getting poison resistance, and adding an extra day to their lifespan at middle age. It's a great system that doesn't remove all of the sting from death but still leaves you feeling like you're making progress through your efforts.Unfortunately, Zanki Zero's combat is easily the worst element of the game. It attempts to marry turn-based, tile-hopping roguelike combat with real-time elements like charge attacks, group combos, and attack cooldowns, but it winds up constantly feeling sluggish and unresponsive. Worse, there's not much in the way of strategy in most of the fights; you usually want to maneuver behind or to the side of an enemy while charging attacks, whacking them when opportunity strikes, then scurry away to avoid retaliation, charge again, and repeat. (Or, if you have a ranged weapon, you plink away with that.) An additional element where you use an aiming reticle to target specific body parts of an enemy just makes things messier, as you have to spend valuable time fidgeting with awkward aiming controls. It's the same reticle you use to examine things in the environment, so if your reticle isn't in the right place (say, you just examined something else not long ago), your attacks can simply miss entirely. It's a shame that combat's such a weird-feeling mess, because it drags down the fun of exploring these urban ruins, finding interesting items and bits left behind, and learning about the characters and the world.Uniqueness is one of Zanki Zero's biggest selling points, but its myriad ambitions and ideas aren't enough to obscure the elements that don't work as well. While the novelty of the game, its interesting story, and engaging exploration do a lot to carry it, it falters in some crucial spots that drag down the whole. "
2040,Banished,8.0,2,"Tropico and creating something unique in the process. If you're reading this, it's safe to assume that you have an Internet-capable device with all of the modern comforts that typically implies. But what if you didn't? What if you were forced out of civilization as you know it, to live in the wilderness? How do you think you'd fare? Banished asks those questions, opening with a dozen or so outcasts seeking to make their way in the wilderness. It's a humble setup, but the game is masterfully constructed with dozens of interlocking mechanics--the perfect foundation for a stinging emergent narrative and a focus on empathy in the face of a Malthusian world. Banished is a series of small goals that feed into one ever-looming command: survive. Every game starts in the spring, and before winter hits, you need to get enough firewood, gather a decent supply of food, and build some houses to keep your citizens from freezing to death. Just getting enough food is tough, because you rarely have enough time or free land to get a proper set of crops growing. Instead, you'll be chopping down as many trees as you can before getting a fishery going in a nearby lake or river. Then you hunker down and hope nobody dies. What if you were forced out of civilization as you know it, to live in the wilderness? How do you think you'd fare? Banished asks those questions, opening with a dozen or so outcasts seeking to make their way alone in the wilderness. People, more than anything else, are your vital resource. They need homes, food, decent clothes, tools, emotional support, medicine, and more. Every mechanic, every building you can place, and everything else you can do relates back to that central theme of survival. If you can't gather enough food, your people die. If they're stuck outside for too long, or don't have warm clothing, they die. Each time you fail as their leader, you're reminded of the loss with a grating sound and a yellow gravestone. These serve as a one-two punch to punish you for failure because losing citizens makes it that much harder to keep up the resource flow. One fewer worker means you can't gather food, stone, wood, or anything else as quickly. When children die, it's even worse, though you likely won't know it for some time. As your population ages, you eventually lose more than a few citizens to old age, and the best way to replace them is to give your younger citizens houses in the hopes that they'll reproduce and bolster your future numbers. Like most games of its type, Banished has a number of natural disasters that strike your populace. In many ways, they serve as a kind of random ""boss fight"" in the sense that they will often test one aspect of your infrastructure. Diseases test the health of your population, fires your city planning, and tornadoes your ability to rapidly rebuild before winter comes again. With Banished already amounting to a desperate attempt to stave off death, disasters can be absolutely devastating for the unprepared. When pests hit your crops and you're already barely squeaking by each year, you're going to start losing a lot of people. Those kinds of cascading failures contrast with the almost hilarious scenarios that surround SimCity's giant robots or aliens. Societal collapse isn't caused just by disasters, though, as maintaining equilibrium with the environment is actually impossible, which is another point of contrast between Banished and other games in its family. Most of the time, resources are unlimited in these sorts of games, but not quite so here. Farms won't continue producing food indefinitely, and most fishermen's docks steadily deplete the available population of fish that you can draw upon. Stone and iron, two critical materials for construction and maintenance, are also finite. After your initial stores run out, you can find some of these materials out in the world, but once you've exhausted those reserves, you're left with two options: trading and mining. Trading is a lot harder than it sounds, as opportunities come only a few times each year. Trade ships also have limited space and don't carry too much with them. Additionally, accepting trade increases your risk of disease and pests for your people and your crops. Mines are just as troublesome. Their supply of stone, iron, and coal is finite, and they take an enormous number of people to operate efficiently; they are also deadly, potentially risking mineshaft collapses or being crushed to death by stone. This, of course, all leads back to the struggle of maintaining your population. Societal collapse isn't caused just by disasters, though, as maintaining equilibrium with the environment is actually impossible. Banished has dozens of these kinds of interlocking, intricately woven systems that all feed into one another. Every decision has a cost, and every choice is a risk. Some elements of city planning are also completely incompatible with each other. To maintain your peoples' health, for example, you need some herbalists. They collect basic resources from the floors of old growth forests and can use them to make poultices that keep your people working their best and resistant to possible disease outbreaks. The key, however, is the ""old growth"" bit. You also need a steady source of logs to chop up for firewood. A good team of foresters can maintain a large enough area of continuous growth, but helpful herbs and wildlife can't be found in such young forests. To maximize your production, you need separate forests for your potion masters and your loggers. This dynamic becomes much harder to balance with the addition of resource-distribution mechanics. Loggers that need to transport the fruits of their labor more than a few tiles begin to lose efficiency and increase the risk of running low on firewood or tools--the two main long-term uses for lumber. If any of these pieces begin to lag, you place yourself and your people at risk of a systemic failure. A reduction in logging output can cause your supply of new tools to run low, dropping your logging output that much further. Everything is a feedback loop. Such strongly linked systems require an enormous amount of care to manage effectively, and that most often comes into play when you're looking to expand your village. If you try to develop a new logging outpost without building a network of roads, supply barns, and the like to make sure the resources keep moving where they are needed, your new loggers will likely die of starvation or hypothermia. You must effectively build semi-self-sufficient towns that link together via markets and high-capacity roads. The game isn't completely unreasonable here, though. If you build a new house near a mine on the edge of town, a few people will probably move in, and their occupation automatically shifts to match the closest workspace that can support them. When everything works, Banished is remarkably rewarding. While the process of survival is never-ending, holding out against the elements amid the hostility of the untamed natural world is a small but powerful personal victory. Villagers have names; they're born, grow up, and eventually die under your intense supervision. Banished reinforces the human drama with its brutal difficulty and negative feedback loops. It's fertile soil for some of the most remarkable emergent storytelling around. With relatively few, well-designed mechanics, the game weaves a powerful tale of empathy and desperation and is a high-water mark for narrative elements that mutually reinforce mechanics. Even better, this is a very human story divorced from the Western tropes common in the loosely imperialistic messages of other, similar games. It's just you, your people, and their strong desire to live."
1611,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series,5.0,1,"Game of Thrones should be renamed ""A Series of Meetings,"" given its string of recent episodes featuring more exposition and chatter than action. I'm applying this moniker to Sons of Winter, the fourth episode of Telltale's Game of Thrones, because it marks a departure from the series' dramatic tension and, unfortunately, is starting to mimic its source material in all-too-predictable ways. That's not to say Sons of Winter is without its bright points, however: they come in the form of the episode's secondary characters, who unravel their own backstories and add more interesting dilemmas. I've praised the the game's focus on the Forrester family before; they are always the most interesting characters on screen at any given time, overshadowing cameos from the TV show's stars. It's been thoroughly delightful (and painful, in that masochistic, enjoyable way) to watch Mira evolve into a sneaking schemer, to see Rodrik struggle to balance the demands of Lady Forrester and his sister Talia without letting either down, and to uncover the mystery of the fabled North Grove with Gared. But their story is starting to to mimic the tale of the Starks--the downtrodden family at the center of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire--with the introduction of new characters and scenarios that come across as though detailed on a writer's checklist of necessary plot points. I can't list all those things here, as doing do would spoil nearly every turning point for the episode, but I can say that if you're familiar with the arcs of Sansa Stark and Jon Snow, you will find few surprises here. We last left Gared Tuttle at the Wall in more trouble that he's ever been, with Mira out of favor with Margaery Tyrell, with Rodrik trying and failing to regain control of Ironrath, and with Asher at the feet of Daenerys Targaryen. Most of the major choices in Sons of Winter revolve around the heroes trying to please one person at the expense of incurring another's wrath--something you've been doing in more exciting, meaningful ways for three episodes already. There's a lot of verbal fencing, but none of it reaches anxious heights of, say, Mira's first conversation with Cersei Lannister in Episode One. For example, Asher's plea to Daenerys to provide an army is rushed and flat, and no matter what you tell her, she continues to threaten you. Having Mira eavesdropping on partygoers and potentially ruin fellow handmaiden Sera's life doesn't feel thrilling, and threats made towards her are all simple variants of ""You'll pay for this!"" and ""We'll get you!"" with little bite behind the bark. Sons of Winter is about defense and safety--protecting yourself and your house, and keeping who you can safe. You can't keep everyone secure, though, and most decisions are predictable: side with Beshka or with your uncle as Asher, side with Sera (or not) as Mira, side with your mother or with the woman you love as Rodrik. These gambits of ""him or her"" decisions, one after another, have become tiring four episodes in. You have to decide how to use the information you have, who to reveal it to, and with whom to use it as a bargaining chip. You'll make people angry, fall further out of favor if you choose to put your family first, and, in one instance, alter someone's only chance at having a good life. You're still being pushed to think of your family first, and endanger yourself in the process, but the emotional risks feel just out of sight here, not in the way that you can sometimes be blind to negative consequences, but in a way that you aren't taking time to weigh outcomes because there is no threat to consider. Having those threats simmer at every major choice has served Game of Thrones well in its first half, but Episode Four drops the tension entirely. In Mira's case, for instance, you gather loads of useful information in a short amount of time and are then able to bully and tease others as you please. But by making Mira powerful, much of what made her storyline frightening has been sidelined. She’s playing the Game of Thrones with no immediate consequence. Perhaps this is the part of Game of Thrones when it's time to talk more and do less, to bide time and wait for opportunity. But the episode's overall goal is to introduce more information, more context, and more characters, and not to drop the Forresters directly into harm's way. There's nothing wrong with slowing down, but Sons of Winter slows to a crawl. Telltale's games are at their best when they drop action sequences into unexpected junctures of downtime, thus creating threats that need to be dealt with immediately and quickly before you can proceed. An entire episode of exposition and lock-picking doesn't contribute to the mood-building, especially in Westeros, and the lengthiest action sequence--a string of running into cover, sneaking, and stealthily taking down guards--is devoid of any real stress or excitement. There are a few emotional cling-points in Sons of Winter, and they revolve around the people who are willing to risk life and limb to help the Forresters. Most notable among these are several scenes with Beskha, the brash and cutthroat sellsword who has become Asher's best friend. You finally learn why she's so tough and why she's loath to return to Meereen, and the scene culminates in one of the most heartbreaking moments in the series so far. Her tragedy outweighs Asher's. By revealing her backstory to Asher, he gains some perspective in his relationship with her, which delivers several sweet, enjoyable moments between the two that are welcome amid the episode's low points. It is also refreshing to see Rodrik's struggle against the Whitehills finally move away from the repetitive cycle of events that characterized the series' first half. As the Whitehills realize they aren't as strong or as powerful as they thought, unlikely allies come to Rodrik's aid. These supporting characters bring a refreshing change to the fight we've seen so far, revealing personalities that alternately clash and meld with the Forresters and bring out new, personal facets of their struggle. Rodrik's beloved, Elaena Glenmore, becomes more important in Episode Four than she's been throughout the series, evolving beyond a love interest and perhaps into something more dangerous as she pushes Rodrik to take action on her behalf. A bit about the presence of the TV show characters: Daenerys is totally out of character. She's mean and hard in ways that she isn't in the TV series. In the show, she is firm and always open to listening, but Telltale has made her into a vicious would-be despot. Her scene happens early in the episode and jarred me out of the experience; she didn't fit, her behavior so off that it was harder for me to find my emotional footing for the rest of the episode. As Telltale's Game of Thrones passes its halfway mark, it takes a bit of a dip, staging a set of scenes that feels less like something you can control and more like something you can only passively watch. There's no sense of agency in the choices you are offered; you simply spin a conversation in a certain direction before arriving at a pre-determined outcome. Sons of Winter is set dressing, though the events of its last two minutes are strong enough of a taster to make you hunger for Episode Five. It's a bit disappointing that the rest of the episode doesn't reach the dramatic bar Telltale has already set for itself.  "
3219,Test Drive Unlimited 2,7.0,2,"          That island (and, after level 10, Oahu island) is handsome and varied, enlivened by weather effects. Electrical storms light up the sky and slick the roads with rain. Day turns into night according to the sped-up, game-world clock accompanied by some glorious sunsets and shimmering tarmac. The beach locations, with turquoise water and palm tree-lined ocean roads, are lifted straight out of an Ibiza tourist brochure. Disappointingly, the landscapes can be troubled by items popping in at a distance, such as trees on a hilly horizon and fence posts on a long highway. Busy scenes suffer slow-down from time to time, a cardinal sin among driving games. Other driving games have more consistently impressive visuals, but despite occasional chug and pop-in, the lasting impression is of a good-looking game, largely thanks to Ibiza's beautiful scenery.       Overall progress is measured as the sum of your levels across the four categories (competition, discovery, collection, and social). Discovery relates to your exploration of the island, clocking up mileage across Ibiza's road network and unlocking new stores as you go. Collection relates to how much of everything you have bought, from cars and houses--increasingly luxurious hubs in which to hang out as your avatar and store your cars--to clothes for your avatar. In this way, discovery and collection progress go hand in hand; discovery makes more car and avatar customizations available to collect as you explore the island map, uncovering car dealerships, shops selling car stickers and upgrades, as well as hair salons and clothes stores. Through these shops, there's plenty of scope for car customization, which extends to ""tuning""--upgrading a car's acceleration, speed, and braking--and decorating your car with stickers and paint jobs across the rainbow spectrum.             By the time you've hit the level 60 ceiling in the four combined categories, you will have bought a lot of cars and clothes and haircuts for your avatar, and upgraded from the trailer hovel in which you begin the game to, most likely, a lavish yacht moored in a sparkling blue marina--all funded by your winnings in the Solar Crown championship and in the single- and multiplayer challenges. The abundance of activities and collectables keep play from feeling like a grind, since there's always something different to do if you tire of one thing. TDU2's not quite got everything--it's a shame the streets are free of Ibizans, and there are no motorbikes to be had. (In addition, a corrupt Xbox 360 savefile might halt your progress, as it did ours.) Nevertheless, the freedom of open-road driving, backed by beautiful landscapes, is like few other games, and the huge, shared world of races and missions can be as addictive as a good MMORPG. The catch is that TDU2 isn't best in any class; it doesn't do any one thing better than a number of more specific, less expansive driving games. It does do an awful lot, though, and won't be kept down by its faults--which are hardly few, but aren't deal breakers either.    "
978,Shadow of the Colossus,9.0,2,"A 2011 HD remaster for the PlayStation 3 alleviated these problems, but now, with 2018's Shadow of the Colossus for PlayStation 4, Bluepoint Games has completely rebuilt every aspect of the game's world while leaving the underlying structure and mechanics intact, a move which not only rejuvenates the game visually but uncategorically intensifies the utter majesty of this extraordinary experience.Shadow of the Colossus takes place in an ancient world, where young warrior Wander and his horse Agro transport a deceased loved one to a forbidden, sealed land. With a mythical sword and an ordinary bow, Wander hopes to take advantage of a fable that suggests something in this isolated province has the means to bring back the dead. There, he encounters an omnipresent entity who compels him to destroy sixteen colossi scattered throughout the territory in order to enable his wish.If you've already played a previous version of Shadow of the Colossus, you'll find that Bluepoint's rendition feels much the same, barring some minor differences in controller mapping, some subtle quality-of-life tweaks, and a new Easter egg. The locations of each colossus and the methods of defeating them remain the same, as do the locations of every white-tailed lizard and fruit collectible. The weight and movement physics of Wander and Agro feel unchanged, and New Game+ rewards are identical.But the impact of the completely rebuilt world is transcendent. This is a world that is geographically as you remember, but one that still astounds you as if seeing it for the first time. Highly detailed environment modeling in tandem with impressive light and shadow simulation bring amazing life to the game's breathtaking biomes. Forests are densely packed with majestic tall trees and twisting foliage, dappled beautifully with soft rays of sunlight. Vast, arid deserts feel hauntingly desolate as you try and sight somber ruins through a wispy sandstorm. Even the simple sight of mountainous crags and cliff faces is impressive, with shadows acutely defining their rocky surfaces, making them pop ominously. Every time you crest a hill, emerge from a crevice, or change your perspective, the landscape will be a sight worthy of pause.The increased fidelity of the reconstructed colossi is just as spectacular, and the mere sight of one in this version of the game is even more awe-inspiring than it is in your memory. Each foe--some small and nimble, the rest impossibly titanic and overbearing--is a terrifying beast of stone, fur, and leather. That fur is now noticeably more dense and luscious, and hanging onto it for dear life as your enemy tries to violently shake you off feels even more intense. These moments are enhanced by the detail of the distant environment that lies far beneath you when on top of a colossus, combined with motion effects that amplify the sense of danger at these dizzying heights. The first time I mounted a flying colossus in this version of the game, I could feel my chest wrench as I squeezed my controller to hold onto its wing for dear life while it soared, flapping wildly through the air. It was exhilarating.Playing on a PS4 Pro offers you the ability to further enhance visual fidelity via high dynamic range color, as well as the choice between two different graphical options with different priorities. Cinematic mode enables 4K resolutions, as well as allowing for impressive downsampling (that is, scaling down a higher-resolution image) for 1080p displays at a targeted 30fps. Performance mode provides less impressive graphical quality but maintains a smoother frame rate targeting 60fps. In my experience, I preferred the crisper image offered in Cinematic mode--once you realise you can recognise the definition between each individual blade of grass, it's hard to let that go. However, the visual quality offered by both modes still enhances the experience of the game in ways previously mentioned, especially for those whose last memory of it was suffering through sub-30fps framerate issues on the original PS2 release.The visual reconstruction doesn't detract from what makes Shadow of the Colossus great, and the game's holistic and understated direction still comes through strongly: its muted colors, cinematic camera angles, and stark absence of music while exploring the world still evoke a poignant tone of desolation and solitude. The world's large forsaken landscape doesn't feel bereft of things to do, because simply riding through it and enjoying at the majesty of the land, accompanied only by the sound of Agro's hooves scraping against the earth, is a meditative experience.Fighting a colossus is still a grand, solemn, and tense challenge that is exhilarating to overcome. The impassioned orchestral soundtrack heightens the pressure of every maneuver: Deciphering a method of mounting your impossibly enormous enemy, clambering to reach their vulnerabilities as they try to fling you off, and driving your sword into their flesh. Every moment of a colossus battle is thrilling to execute and witness, whether you're doing it for the first time, or the fifteenth time in a post-game time trial.While the passing of twelve years hasn't affected the overall quality of Shadow of the Colossus, there are two technical annoyances that persist and remind you of a bygone era. The third-person camera system does not clip through world objects, so it becomes erratic and troublesome to adjust when moving Wander through enclosed spaces, or near a solid object. Additionally, the game's unforgiving climbing system, which asks you to jump with the X button and grasp onto a ledge or surface with the R2 trigger, is occasionally temperamental in certain situations; there may be times when contact with a ledge may not correctly register even though you may have been holding R2 well in advance and correctly estimated the distance needed for your jump. However, both of these issues affect only a small amount of your time with the game and should not be considered a significant strike against the whole. In the case of the climbing system, it's a quirk that's easy to come to peace with because of how absolutely essential the mechanic is to creating the rousing pressure and suspense of colossus encounters.Shadow of the Colossus is a tremendous journey, and one well worth taking and retaking. The visual overhaul is stunning, thoroughly enhancing every facet of Wander and Agro's excellent adventure. Galloping through the tranquil world is always breathtaking; felling a monumental colossus is always humbling. Shadow of the Colossus is a beautiful reconstruction of an already exceptional title. It continues to be a modern classic and is an extraordinary game that everyone must experience."
3055,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,8.0,2,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. When it came out in 1998 for the Nintendo 64, Ocarina of Time set a new standard for three-dimensional action and introduced gameplay mechanics that are still copied today. Though it has since appeared on the GameCube and the Wii Virtual Console, the new version for the Nintendo 3DS marks the first time this classic has received a significant update. The completely overhauled visuals are the most striking improvement, and they infuse this 13-year-old game with a vibrant modern feel. The sharp motion controls and the video hint system are new additions that fit in well, but the real star is the original adventure. Though it shows its age, Link's quest is indeed a timeless one that is full of invigorating exploration, tricky puzzles, satisfying combat, memorable characters, and stirring music. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is a great way to experience this seminal adventure, and it's a shining example of how old can be made new again.          The world of Hyrule has been reinvented many times over in the Legend of Zelda series, but the visual makeover of Ocarina of Time's Hyrule is something different. The cozy village in Kokiri Forest sparkles with vivid foliage and golden shafts of sunlight, which is an early testament to the improved graphics. As with many adventures, your quest starts out small but quickly broadens in scope, sending you out into the expansive Hyrule Field where day turns to night as you appreciate the soft violets and deep purples of dusk. From here, you can travel to Castle Town, where first-time visitors will encounter a bustling plaza and sleepy alleyways. Returning visitors with good memories will be impressed by the improvements made to the buildings that make each shop burst with life. When you step inside one, you see that building interiors now feature more furniture, wallpaper, picture frames, and assorted knickknacks, making them some of the most dramatically enriched areas.      These aesthetic improvements haven't been made just for the sake of putting more stuff in there; in fact, the relative emptiness of many areas is one of the ways Ocarina of Time 3D shows its 64-bit roots. Villages, fields, and dungeons have a somewhat sparse feel when compared to the rich environments of many modern games. Despite this austerity, you still feel like you are exploring a fertile world. Keeping an eye out for anomalous areas can lead to a crucial discovery or a pleasant reward, and you regularly encounter things that you can't make heads or tails of until later in your adventure. Though the main quest is fairly linear, there is an abundance of mysteries to solve, (one-sided) conversations to have, and places to explore. When a villager tells you of rumors of a far-off land, and you later get to travel there to see it for yourself, it creates the sense that things are connected. When you hear a legend about an object that lets its owner see the truth, you've got some hunting to do.        The pursuit of objects is key to your quest in ridding the land of a great evil. In addition to uniting powerful artifacts, you acquire an array of weapons, clothing, tools, and items that can help you along the way. You get many of these as a necessary part of your journey, yet some are found only by going off the beaten path (by, say, helping a lady with her escaped chickens). It's a pleasure to build and upgrade your arsenal, even if you already know where to get the biggest wallet in the land. Some items, like the slingshot and bow, even benefit from the addition of motion controls. Whipping out one of these weapons snaps the camera into a first-person view. All you have to do is angle your 3DS to set up your aim and fire. These controls are not only quicker than the circle pad (you can turn motion controls off in the options menu), but they are also a lot more fun. Plugging a target from across the room with an arrow is more satisfying when you physically aim the 3DS, and looking around your environment (a crucial skill in Ocarina of Time 3D) is much quicker and easier. The only caveat is that this kind of aiming can cause the 3D effect to go out of whack, but this is easily solved by moving your head in sync with your arms or just flicking the 3D slider to off.         Weapons can also be fired at specific targets using the vaunted target-lock mechanic that Ocarina of Time introduced years ago. This system, now widely used in many games, is an effective combat aid that allows you to focus your attacks on one particular enemy. It can be finicky at times and require you to reorient the camera to actually obtain a lock, but as long as you give yourself some distance from your enemy before fiddling with your view, you should emerge victorious. Though there are some tough foes, combat in Ocarina of Time 3D usually presents a fair challenge. Most of your enemies can be vanquished with your trusty sword and judicious use of timing, dodging, and blocking, with enemies emitting a satisfying squish or death wail when you defeat them. Some kills are even more satisfying here than they were in other versions of Ocarina of Time because the revamped textures make your enemies look extra threatening. And if you fancy another run at any of the big bosses you conquer in your quest, a visit to your childhood home in Kokiri Forest lets you tackle these battles again in your dreams (a new feature for the 3DS version).         Puzzles are more likely to slow your progress than combat, and they make up a significant amount of the time you spend in the game's many dungeons and temples. At the time of the original release, adventuring in a three-dimensional world was still a novel phenomenon, and as such, many of the puzzles presented spatial challenges that involved moving objects around or observing 360-degree views of your surroundings. The intervening years have taken the shine off of some of these puzzles, and even first timers will find them simplistic. Yet the majority of the original level design still holds up well, and there is still satisfaction aplenty to be found in navigating temples (even if you've been there before). Some parts that were stumpers then are still tricky now, but players of Ocarina of Time 3D have an advantage that their predecessors did not. In the gameworld, there are now locations where you can receive visions of the challenges you face. These are video hints that show a series of brief scenes and illuminate the solutions to many of the game's puzzles. They reveal just enough to set you straight without spoiling the result, though if you're still stumped, you can always suspend the software, access the Web browser from the Home menu, and look up an online walkthrough.      With a long main quest and a bevy of other goals to pursue, you can easily spend more than 20 hours on your Ocarina of Time 3D play-through. Your entire journey is woven together by the excellent musical score that is as crucial in creating a sense of place as the environmental design. The brisk tune of Castle Town contrasts sweetly with the sleepy pastoral sounds of Lon Lon Ranch. Traveling from the jovial plunking beat of Goron City to the looming ambient tones of Dodongo's Cavern lets you know things are getting serious, while your travels to the western reaches of the map bring exotic strains unfamiliar to your Hyrulian ear. You meet many characters in your travels--the most memorable of whom have their own musical themes--and this connection deepens your emotional investment in the tale. And, of course, there's the titular ocarina. You wield this instrument in times of joy and times of trial; you play it to conjure helpful items and to whisk yourself across a continent. Music suffuses every aspect of this game, taking an epic adventure and making it soar.        When you've seen your journey to completion, you unlock the Master Quest, a tougher version of the same game you just beat. All of the environments are mirrored, which gives things a refreshingly unfamiliar feel. The dungeons and temples are also stocked with more enemies and restructured puzzles to test your mettle. It's a shame the Master Quest isn't unlocked from the beginning to give veteran players an advanced point of entry, but Ocarina of Time 3D should tempt both young Kokiri and wizened Heroes of Time. Though its roots show through from time to time, the improved visuals remove any barrier of entry that age may have posed. The new elements enhance the core adventure to create the definitive version of this classic game, making Ocarina of Time 3D the best way to embark on (or relive) this landmark adventure.   "
3018,Akimi Village,6.0,1,"A Kingdom for Keflings and A World of Keflings--alleviated some of the potential boredom with online co-op, mini-quests, and multiple maps. Akimi Village takes the simple template of those games and makes it even simpler--and thus, less compelling. Yet while you might struggle with bouts of occasional tedium, it's rewarding to watch your petite empire take form, and to turn the world's gloomy pockets of blackness into sunny pastures ready to be harvested for their stone and wood.         Akimi Village is a city builder with a focus on supply lines. As either a male or female avatar, you develop the village by assigning collection and transport tasks to blue creatures called Akimi. To give an Akimi a job, you pick one up and set it in front of the resource you want it to gather or the pile of resources you want it to transport. Then, you drop it in front of the structure you want it to transport these goods to. From here, you walk up to various supply structures and order components to be produced. To build structures, you pick up these components one at a time and drop them on an available plot of land. Need to build a workshop? Head to your work hut and queue up the right trinkets. Want a temple? That requires that you have a workshop, a sculptor, a gardener, and a master craftsman first, because each building produces items necessary for your temple's creation. Once you get used to the largely pictorial interface, it's easy to understand how to bring your plans to fruition. Each structure's construction menu identifies what you need to queue up based on your currently chosen blueprint, and a glowing cursor highlights the ground where you should place each component.     As you progress, buildings require more and more objects to complete them, and thus, more complex supply chains. As a result, you need to put more and more Akimi to work. There are available helpers scattered about the land, but they aren't available for serfdom immediately. These Akimi roam dark, colorless land called The Gloom. Every so often, you earn a special acorn for a job well done. To free gloomy Akimi from their dismal existence, you drop these acorns into fissures known as spirit wells. Doing so causes a flowery flourish of color, and the sun again shines on a chunk of previously miserable land where the freed Akimi are now thrilled to do your bidding. In city builders, it's always a delight to see a bustling community emerge from almost nothing. Watching these dead areas spring to life enhances that inherent satisfaction even further.        Unfortunately, where Akimi Village stumbles is in its moment-to-moment pacing. As your modest kingdom grows, you must haul objects further and further across the map. Because later structures require many more components than early ones, you eventually spend a lot of time trekking across the same stretches of land just to assemble a single dojo. This often leads to monotony, which is exacerbated by some of Akimi Village's small but irritating issues. Some structures are add-ons to existing ones, such as the gate and the temple. You might place the initial buildings close to other structures or resource nodes, only to discover later that you've built yourself into a corner and have to move a structure to another spot. The problem? In order to do so, you have to deconstruct it and move every individual component. And thus, you add another exhausting five minutes to an already slow task. A World of Keflings already addressed this issue by letting you move entire buildings; that it wasn't dealt with here is flabbergasting.      For that matter, the Keflings games broke up the drudgery in a number of ways, such as short quests, different environments, and even assistants that could finish build tasks on your behalf. Akimi Village takes place on one pretty but otherwise uninteresting map and involves creating supply lines and then walking around and building stuff--but nothing more. Without the little touches to keep you interested, Akimi Village reveals this formula for what it is: a shallow city builder in which you control the slowest mouse cursor ever. Eventually you can build portals that help ease the grind of trudging back and forth, but you'll long for the ability hours before you actually unlock the portal blueprint.         Yet while this slow pace can make for monotony, it is sometimes agreeably Zen-like. This is a sandbox game without pressure or time constraints. The soundtrack is made up of lush harmonies, tinkling glockenspiel melodies, and occasional vocalizations, sometimes laid on top of lively beat patterns. The music is tranquil in just the right way. Any more energetic and it would have been too cutesy; any more stagnant and it might have put you to sleep. Watching Akimi cheerfully pull rickshaws and prance about with bundles of straw in their arms will endear them to you, and the sad Akimi ambling in The Gloom look so despondent, they may break your heart. There's a good-natured, sometimes surreal charm to the structure descriptions and bits of dialogue. (The inn description states: ""Visiting Akimi stay at the local inn. It doesn't have Wi-Fi, but the Akimi don't mind."") When you don't move for a while, your avatar rises into the air in a lotus position--a nice touch in a game designed to relax you.     All too often, however, Akimi Village stops being relaxing and becomes boring. It takes about six to eight hours to restore this single village to its former glory, but while the game is long as far as downloadable games go, it is never substantial--what would amount to an hour's worth of gameplay with a mouse cursor stretched into a full $9.99 game. There's never a reason you should run out of supplies; as long as you have proper supply lines set up, resources take care of themselves. Nonetheless, you can send resources to other players on your friend's list, or even take a look at their village. What you can't do, however, is join them--either online or locally. (Co-op play is another feature inexplicably stripped from the formula.) Co-op play, like quests and visual diversity, could have broken up the monotony that so often visits this quirky village. But if you're the patient sort looking for a diversion on a lazy afternoon, this peaceful city builder might soothe your savage inclinations.     "
4217,Star Trek: Shattered Universe,4.0,0," Star Trek games, much like the many other facets of the Star Trek franchise, tend to be either very good or very poor, without much of a gray area in between. Star Trek: Shattered Universe, the latest game to bear the Trek name, regrettably falls toward the poorer branch of the Trek universe. Brought to you by TDK Mediactive and developer Starsphere Interactive, Shattered Universe is essentially a lazily designed space shooter that takes place inside an alternate universe depicted in an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series called ""Mirror, Mirror."" In this universe, everything is backward--the Federation is now an evil empire, former foes are now your allies, and everybody either has a scar, a goatee, or something similar to clearly indicate that you are most definitely in some sort of bizarro universe. This concept itself obviously isn't a terribly original one, and Shattered Universe's gameplay mechanics are equally pedestrian in design, hopelessly trying to mirror bigger, better space combat games.       There isn't a whole lot to Shattered Universe's plot beyond an extremely basic setup. Essentially, you play as a nameless member of the crew of the U.S.S. Excelsior, commanded by George Takei's Captain Sulu. At the beginning of the game, the Excelsior is called to aid the U.S.S. Enterprise, which has become trapped in some sort of space anomaly (and also happens to be captained by Walter Koenig's Commander Chekov). Upon its arrival, the Excelsior is pulled into the anomaly and is spit out into an unfamiliar universe. A battle with an alternate version of the Enterprise--captained by a now-evil Chekov--then ensues, and although you are eventually victorious, the anomaly disappears, leaving you no immediate escape back to your own universe. From there on out, the Excelsior's task is to get home by trying to find this anomaly once again. Along the way, you'll engage in a lot of meaningless combat while meandering around this strange universe, performing one dull task after another.   There are 19 missions in Shattered Universe. Each mission has multiple objectives, some of which you find out at the very beginning of the mission and some of which appear only after you're neck-deep into one. Each mission is prefaced by a somewhat drawn-out and perplexingly, uninformative briefing from Captain Sulu. Missions primarily have you flying around in one of the game's several small fighter ships--which include a couple of Federation-brand fighters, a Klingon Bird of Prey, and a Romulan Shrike--blasting other fighters, collecting random items, and occasionally engaging starships. The problem with the game's missions is that they never really feel like they have much purpose, nor are they particularly well paced.    Several chapters require you to go on ""scout"" missions, where you essentially fly from one navigation point to another, collecting minerals for some unknown reason, and in between, you shoot a lot of fighters. In another mission, you have to protect the Excelsior from an Enterprise attack. Your goal is to damage the Enterprise so that it will retreat. Once you've done that, the Enterprise launches a warhead at the Excelsior. Sulu informs you that the warhead is too heavily shielded to be destroyed, so you need to go destroy the rest of the Enterprise's fighter squadron in three minutes. How does destroying a group of fighters save the Excelsior from a seemingly indestructible warhead, and why does the task need to be completed in three minutes? No satisfactory answers are given for these or any number of other questions that will likely pop into your head while playing the game. Additionally, most of the missions can take anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes to complete, and it is far too easy for you to end up getting smoked right at the end of a mission when some late-mission objective presents itself out of the blue, thus causing you to have to start all over again.   These problems might be forgivable if Shattered Universe's combat were well designed, but unfortunately it isn't. Each fighter ship has three basic weapons: a basic phaser, a bolt weapon (which is like a quick, short phaser burst), and photon torpedoes. When engaging smaller ships, really, the only weapon that is of any use to you is the basic phaser, since the leading targeting reticle for your targeted ship isn't accurate enough for your bolt weapon, and photon torpedoes are completely useless unless you're attacking a starship. Also, despite the fact that the game can be rather trying, the AI of opposing ships isn't especially brilliant. Fighters have some rather rudimentary attack patterns that can be easily avoided with some decent flying skills. As for the starships, the only real challenge comes from the fact that their weapons are pretty adept at taking you out in only a couple of short bursts. However, some missions do require you to destroy starships, so generally, your best bet is to find a spot within tight range of the opposing ship--so that its weapons can't lock onto you--and start hammering the attack buttons for the several minutes it takes to destroy the ship. If this doesn't sound like much fun, well, you're right, it isn't.   As far as Shattered Universe's presentational aspects go, you can't help but think that the developers really didn't put much effort into any of them. The game's graphics definitely aren't anything special--ship designs lack much in the way of detail, and the various effects used for phaser fire, explosions, and the like all look extremely low-rent. The same can be said for the multitude of different space environments in the game. Though there's a decent variety of different background elements, like nebulae, space stations, asteroid fields, and even occasional planets, none of them look in any way impressive. The game also features a number of awful CG cutscenes, with in-game versions of Sulu and Chekov that are laughable at best. Every CG character moves in painfully slow motion, and the actual renderings barely look anything like the actors, especially Sulu, who looks like some kind of decrepit skeleton. The PS2 and Xbox versions of the game look near-identical in every way. For what it's worth, the Xbox version does support 480p, though it doesn't look much better when using it.      Shattered Universe's sound design is equally as unimpressive as the game's visuals. It should have been a simple task for George Takei and Walter Koenig to reprise their longtime roles as Sulu and Chekov in Shattered Universe, and yet, somehow, when you listen to them talk in the game, it sounds more like this is their first experience with the roles. Takei phones in his performance horribly, flatly reading every line as though it were some kind of college dissertation, and as for Koenig, though he tries to emphasize the inherent ""evilness"" of his mirror-universe character, it just comes off more as unintentional parody than anything else. In terms of in-game sound, there's a limited amount of music that plays throughout the game, as well as some rather bland-sounding phaser and explosion sounds, but not much else.   Perhaps if it existed in an alternate universe, Star Trek: Shattered Universe might be a game worth playing. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In our universe, Shattered Universe's dull, unimaginative gameplay, redundant mission structure, and highly unimpressive production values make for a pretty lousy game all around. As an attempt at Star Trek, it wastes every opportunity given to it to do something even mildly interesting or entertaining, and it certainly won't please any fan of the franchise. As for its place among space combat games, it is completely unimpressive in every imaginable way and is easily shown up by practically every game currently available in the genre today. There's just nothing about Shattered Universe worth recommending to Star Trek fans or space shooter fans, and if you fall into either category, you're definitely better off looking elsewhere for your particular needs.

963,Fe,7.0,2,"In Fe, your most powerful tool is your voice. You, a small fox-like creature, can use your songlike call to befriend other animals, open up new pathways in the environment, and distract the game's mechanical enemies. But you also have to know when to stay quiet and silently read the signals of the other forest animals around you. Communication, and the connections between living things, are at the heart of Fe's gorgeous woodland world. That world is a delight to explore, and though the act of exploration never builds to something greater, it's a captivating and often melancholic look at our relationship with nature.Fe drops you in the forest all alone, with no clear purpose or direction. You can communicate using a garbled, baby-talk sort of call, and you're given one small bit of instruction as you begin to wander the ethereal forest: ""Sing gently with animals."" The harder you press the trigger, the louder you'll ""sing,"" and you have to strike the right note to communicate with the different species around you.Each species' unique song has its own use; certain plants respond to birds' calls, while others only open for deer's voices. In addition to being absolutely adorable, a baby salamander's chirp will open up a pink flower you can bounce on to get to high-up areas. Animals you befriend will follow you around, and their songs will give you access to places you couldn't reach alone. You need to work with the other animals--and eventually learn their various ""languages""--to traverse the forest.Exploring in Fe is very much a give-and-take. Early on, you can't get anywhere without the help of another animal, but typically, those animals (or the plants they interact with) are leading you to others who need help. In one of the most memorable parts of the game, following a deer through the woods will lead you to a giant deer struggling against its chains. You have to sneak your way past machines patrolling the area, destroy the machines' webs to break the chains and release the deer, and carefully climb the deer to communicate with it. The climb itself is breathtaking, as you're jumping from tree to tree growing along the deer's sky-scraping body, but the stillness afterward, when the deer teaches you its call as thanks, is stunning in its own way.Those moments of peace--by way of the harmonies you've made with other creatures--are shattered quickly and easily by Fe's inorganic enemies, whose harsh industrial lights and abrasive noises pierce the solemn orchestral music of the forest. If they spot you, you have to find somewhere to hide and fast, or you'll be caught in their webs. It's not hard to stay stealthy and save yourself, but you'll end up watching at least once as the friendly animals you had in tow get captured one by one--and it's heartbreaking.Fe is hauntingly beautiful, and as a result, it often doesn't feel like the relatively simple platformer-adventure game it is. Like a lot of similar games, you collect items--in this case, pink crystals--around the world to unlock new abilities. But finding those crystals is more a consequence of following other animals and seeing where the flora and fauna take you, not a primary goal or even a strictly necessary one. Only two unlockable skills, climbing trees and gliding, are required to finish the game, and you'll find enough crystals to get them in the first hour or so as long as you follow the surprisingly linear routes in front of you.The simplicity of Fe's mechanics becomes more apparent sometime after helping the giant deer. There's a distinct pattern: Save some animals, learn their call, and use that call to turn flowers into different kinds of platforms so you can move on to the next section. Very rarely does what you learned before come in handy again later in creative or surprising ways, even after you've learned every song. While this leaves room for you to think about the greater meaning behind what you're doing--rather than the discrete objectives in your path--it's disappointing that the skills you learn from each species never meaningfully combine, especially when the connections you make with each of the living things around you are so important at first blush.But despite being one-note on a gameplay level, Fe's world, with its lush environments and wistful score, compels you to explore. Establishing fleeting connections with the creatures around you is both charming and a little sad, and learning the truth about the enemy machines is even more tragic. By the end, the most important thing you've learned is how to connect with nature, not just by singing with animals but by understanding the world around you."
3345,Rock Band 3,9.0,2,"Rock Band blazed a new trail in the rhythm game genre, Rock Band 3 takes the art of living-room rock to new heights. A new keyboard peripheral joins guitars, drums, and microphones, providing a great new way to play along. And if you want to take your musical skills beyond the fake plastic stage, the new Pro modes and instrument training sessions can help you on your way. Though these impressive instructive modes require pricey extra peripherals, you don't need to pay a premium to enjoy Rock Band 3. It's easier than ever to have an awesome time playing your plastic instruments and singing your heart out, thanks to the ingenious menus, the rewarding goal system, and the diverse 83-song setlist. Rock Band 3 builds on all the things that made its predecessors great and introduces some engrossing new elements, making it the most robust rhythm game on consoles today.          One of the best ways to enjoy Rock Band 3 is the same way you've been enjoying Rock Band for years--get a bunch of friends together and rock out using two guitars, a drum set, and up to three microphones (thanks to the inclusion of vocal harmonies). Though only four profiles can be signed in at once, up to seven people can play at the same time using the aforementioned instruments and the new keyboard peripheral. Playing songs in Quickplay is an easy way to get things rocking, and it's now even easier thanks to new song sorting options, built-in setlists from developer Harmonix, and the ability to download user-created setlists. You can also take on one of the many Road Challenges, which are like segmented versions of the World Tour that appeared in previous Rock Band games. These short tours string together a few setlists and feature bonus goals that give you extra credit for feats like deploying overdrive or accumulating long note streaks. Road Challenges nicely harness the progression-oriented appeal of a career mode and neatly avoid the rigidity of previous World Tours, creating a great blend of structure and flexibility.      Regardless of which mode you are playing, your performance earns you progress toward a bevy of overarching goals that reward you for a wide variety of accomplishments. Some are simple, like visiting the downloadable music store, and others are more challenging, like playing a 500-note streak. Some can be accomplished in the span of one song (hit 100 percent of the notes in a solo), while others take much longer (earn a career score of 5 million points). Completing goals can earn you fans for your band and gear for your character, as well as bragging rights on the online leaderboards. Almost every performance can earn you some sort of progress, and it's pleasantly satisfying to finish a setlist and watch the fans roll in.     Aside from refining and improving the familiar Rock Band experience, Rock Band 3 supports a new instrument peripheral to bolster your band. The sold-separately keyboard ($79.99, or in a bundle with the game for $129.99) gives you a chance to tickle the ivories along with some excellent songs and offers two distinct ways to play. In straightforward Keys mode, you use only five white keys, and the note highway looks just like that of a guitar or bass. This mode is a great way to cut loose on the keyboard, especially if you've attached a strap in order to rock out keytar-style. The one-button-per-finger ratio also makes it arguably the easiest instrumental entry point into the series for those who haven't cut their teeth on a guitar or drum set.         If you want to take on a more serious challenge, you can also play the keyboard in Pro mode. Here, you use both white and black keys across the 25-key peripheral to play parts that more closely mimic what it is like to actually play a given song. Just like when you play another instrument, Pro Keys has a difficulty scale that allows you to ease into it. There are also extensive lessons that cater to all levels of players, teaching things ranging from simple scales all the way up through chords and arpeggios. The lessons are clearly and logically delivered, offering novice keyboardists plenty of room to work on their skills. Those with experience playing actual keyboards or pianos are also advised to check out some of the lessons in order to familiarize themselves with the way Rock Band 3 handles the instrument. Though the vertically scrolling note highway does a good job of visually representing the notes, it is unlike any other music reading experience you are likely to have had. Furthermore, you may have to resist your hand positioning instincts in order to get comfortable with the keyboard. Yet though Pro Keys probably won't earn you a spot in a real band, it cultivates dexterity and musical sensibility in a concrete, transferrable way that was previously accessible only for Rock Band drummers. And once you get the hang of it, it makes rocking out feel a whole lot cooler.     There is also a Pro Drums mode that incorporates cymbals that you can attach to your drum set. These offer the opportunity to play the already-legit drums in a more engaging, challenging, and legitimate way, but you have to buy the cymbals ($39.99) if you want to indulge your inner Neil Peart. The peripheral required for Pro Guitar also involves a hefty additional investment, but  the excellent training lessons will help teach you dexterity and core concepts that apply to real-world guitar playing. Actual guitarists face a similar learning curve to actual keyboardists because they must get accustomed to reading musical notation the Rock Band 3 way and, at least until the compatible stringed guitar is released, contend with a not-quite-the-real-thing peripheral. The expensive guitar peripheral ($149.99) replaces strings with more than 100 tiny plastic buttons, and it can be tricky to find your place in the sea of little nubs. Still,  it allows you to play Rock Band using actual guitar fingerings, and the note highway does an impressive job of communicating a lot of information in an intelligible way.         Though these Pro modes come with an extra cover charge, they offer something truly unique in the realm of rhythm games: a way to turn time spent with Rock Band into skills that can help you learn to play an actual instrument. Practicing chords over and over again may not be as unabashedly fun as ripping into an intense solo with only five fret buttons to worry about, but the thrill of building some musical skills definitely provides some strong satisfaction. Yet even if you don't invest in the brave new world of Pro mode, Rock Band 3 is still an excellent game that provides the best platform yet for plastic living-room rock. A slick menu system ties it all together, making it easy to swap around difficulty levels, instruments, and even profiles without having to back out to the main menu. It seamlessly incorporates all your downloaded or imported tracks, and pipes in leaderboard info to fuel the competitive fire within. Rock Band 3 not only introduces new and exciting things to the world of rhythm games, but it does almost everything better than those that have come before it. When it comes to accessible, inventive, and immensely entertaining music video games, nobody does it better than Rock Band 3.    "
209,Hatsune Miku: Project Diva MegaMix,8.0,2,"When the Hatsune Miku voice software debuted back in 2007, few could have guessed the tremendous impact it would have. The concept of a virtual singer--one whose songs were almost entirely user-generated--was a bizarre and intriguing novelty. 15 years later, Miku and her friends have endured, solidifying their reputations as pioneers across music, the internet, and gaming cultures. Sega's Hatsune Miku: Project Diva serves as a powerful testament to the aquamarine-haired songstress' lasting legacy, and Project Diva Megamix+ is a phenomenal reminder of Miku's musical significance.Like previous games in the series, Project Diva Megamix+ is a rhythm game built around the popular Japanese ""virtual singer"" characters of Hatsune Miku, the Kagamine Rin and Len duo, Megurine Luka, Meiko, and Kaito. Each game in the series offers a selection of songs sourced from independent creators who've made songs using these characters. Most of these tracks also feature an elaborately choreographed, real-time music video that plays in the background, which can be customized with costumes and accessories for the characters you earn with in-game currency.Megamix+ is an enhanced port of 2020's Hatsune Miku Project Diva Megamix for Switch, which itself was a “best-of” compilation based on the arcade and PS4 game Hatsune Miku Project Diva Future Tone. That might sound a little confusing if you're not familiar with the series chronology, but the important thing is that it means that Megamix+ has no shortage of music. From the moment you boot the game, over 100 tracks--including many that were DLC-only on the Switch version--are ready to play. There's also optional paid DLC to add most of the songs from PS4/arcade Future Tone that didn't make it into the Switch game, and with up to five uniquely charted difficulty levels available for each song, you get a huge amount of bang for your buck, regardless of if you spring for the DLC.What makes the sheer amount of music contained in Megamix+ even better is how much variety can be found among the songs. The music of Hatsune Miku and friends is largely made by independent creators with varied musical styles and tastes, and the selection of tunes here showcases exactly that. You'll find a little bit of everything here: cheerful bouncy pop (LOL Lots of Laugh, Clover Club, Dreamin ChuChu), fast-paced rock (Rolling Girl, Ghost Rule), techno-industrial (Sadistic.Music∞Factory), bossa nova (Tricolore Airline), prog-rock (Meltdown), novelty earworms (Po Pi Po), eurobeat (Luka Luka Night Fever), jazz and piano (On the Rocks, Piano x Forte x Scandal), classic game music with new vocals (After Burner, Like the Wind) and even ridiculous memes (Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! aka the Nyan Cat song). There are also a lot of offbeat tracks that are hard to pigeonhole into specific genres, like Alien Alien, Jitterbug, and Ooedo Julianight. Sweetening the selection is that each song comes with a unique and lavishly produced video featuring distinct backgrounds, choreography, and character models. Suffice to say, even if you're not well-versed in the world of Miku's music and producers, you're bound to find a lot here to enjoy--which makes Megamix+ an ideal entry point for those curious about the series.Like many music games, the mechanics are deceptively simple initially. The notes you need to hit are displayed over the music video as it plays. The control pad and face buttons are used to hit these notes as they fly onto the screen, while a spinning dial hand indicates the correct timing for each note (the perfect timing being high noon). Both the d-pad and controller face buttons are usable for the same inputs -- for example, if you're using an Xbox controller, you can press either up on the d-pad or Y to successfully hit a note labeled ↑ or Y. There are also slides, which can be performed by tilting the left or right analog sticks in the direction indicated for a set amount of time.Simple, right? But where things start to get a bit tricky is in the introduction of hold notes and connected notes. Hold notes give an extra score bonus when they're held down, but you'll frequently be asked to both hold down that note and hit a bunch of other notes at the same time, requiring dextrous use of both the D-pad and face button inputs. Linked notes require you to press two or more buttons at the same time, and can be hold notes as well.As simple as this might sound, things in Project Diva can start to escalate very quickly. A song that starts with simple rhythmic button taps can evolve into a complex composition of sudden swipes, rapid-fire simultaneous multidirectional inputs, and challenging hold patterns requiring you to carefully (and quickly) coordinate D-pad and face button presses. Since a huge chunk of the screen is used to display inputs, notes can come flying in from every which way, requiring you to keep your eyes fixed on the entire screen lest a stray input zoom in from parts unknown. There's definitely a learning curve when it comes to anything past Normal difficulty, as the inputs that start to be frequently utilized in Hard can be quite daunting. The game's solution to this is Challenge Time, a brief period during songs on Easy and Normal difficulties where you're given some of the more demanding inputs frequently seen on higher difficulties. You can't fail out of a song during Challenge Time, making it relatively risk-free--though your performance does factor into your overall score, giving you an incentive to perform well. It's a clever way to help ease players into more challenging mechanics and push them to try higher difficulties once they feel comfortable. Charts across all difficulties are well-designed and engaging, making you feel as though you're part of the song--an absolutely make-or-break element for rhythm games that Megamix+ nails expertly.Aside from the expanded music selection, Megamix+ offers a few extras over the Switch original. Players can now freely switch between the simpler character models of Megamix to the higher-polycount, more detailed models of Future Tone. You can also change the in-song note displays to match a variety of controller types, including the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch controllers--or even just directional arrows. You can also use and customize a keyboard layout to play songs with, though it never quite feels “right,” especially when doing slide notes. (You also can't customize the note display to exactly match your chosen keyboard inputs--even if you're playing with WASD and numpad you're stuck with arrow, symbol, or controller button displays.) Mix Mode and Tap Play, the JoyCon and touchscreen modes from the Switch version, are both absent here,--but given how gimmicky and unsatisfying those modes felt, I think most players won't miss them.Is Megamix+ worth it if you already own Future Tone or Megamix on Switch? It's a very comprehensive package, but unless PC is your absolute preferred platform, it's hard to recommend to series veterans who already have every DLC pack for the previous console games. The extra features are nice, but not enough on their own for a double- or triple-dip. Also, in order to unlock the Extreme and Extra Extreme difficulties for each song, you need to clear each of them individually on Hard, which will be tedious for music game devotees who want those crazy-hard charts but have to manually unlock them all yet again.But for series newcomers and PC-focused players, Megamix+ is an easy recommendation. There's a ton of content here, built upon a strong rhythm-game foundation that challenges you to grow your skills and aim ever higher--all while having fun watching music videos, playing dress-up, and collecting all the cool and wacky customizations for the entire cast. But most importantly, Megamix+ is the best showcase of Miku's legacy to date, showcasing the unbridled creativity and variety of the online musical and artistic subcultures she's inspired."
4879,Delta Ops: Army Special Forces,2.0,0," Remember the 2002 budget game Shadow Force: Razor Unit? Probably not. As forgettable as budget PC games get, Shadow Force was a shabby, uninteresting first-person shooter that put you in the soldier role as a member of the Air Force Special Operations Unit. The levels were ugly, the AI was a mess, and the game was simply not worth the time or effort it took to play. Nearly two years after Shadow Force, Activision Value released a ""new"" game called Delta Ops: Army Special Forces. And by ""new,"" we mean ""Shadow Force with a new name.""      The only indicator that an otherwise-unsuspecting customer would get that this is actually a 2002 release is found on the back of the box, where the package admits, in fine print, that Delta Ops was ""previously released as Shadow Force."" However, if you look a little deeper, you'll see a few other signs that this game isn't a recent development. For instance, the game tries to install DirectX 8.1 as part of its install process, even if you already have a later version installed.   After an entirely needless training session, the game drops you into the desert for 10 levels of bad enemy AI, ugly graphics, and, above all, very boring gameplay. While the game gives you objectives to complete, none of them are interesting enough to cut through the game's problems. Even when you compare it to the fairly low standards of most budget games, Delta Ops comes up short. The weapons are bland, the controls for picking up or manipulating items are clunky, and there really just isn't enough to do.   Interestingly enough, some changes have been made to the game, but they don't really improve matters very much. Finding multiplayer games--if there were any--in Shadow Force was nearly impossible, since the game didn't have an in-game server browser, and it didn't offer support for third-party browser tools. Delta Ops has a server browser and a lobby option, which is nice because it takes the guesswork out of the process and lets you know right off the bat that there aren't any multiplayer servers running. In the strange event that you were to actually find a server running, or if you wanted to mess around with the game's dodgy, well-hidden bot support, you'd be able to play deathmatch, team deathmatch, or capture the flag in 16-player matches.   Graphically, Delta Ops wasn't a looker when it was released in 2002. So, as you can imagine, it certainly doesn't look any better today. The movement feels jerky, the textures are a total mess, and the environments are completely bland. In addition to that, on some machines, the game runs at a stuttery, unplayable pace. This isn't a system requirements issue, since the systems we tested it on outpace the game's measly Pentium II requirements by a long shot, but it affects everything--from the gameplay to the video intro to the menu screens.      The game's sound certainly doesn't save it either. Delta Ops has some voice work that pops up throughout the missions--usually to point you in the right direction--but it sounds incredibly unprofessional, both in content and in recording. It's almost as if the developer just had the programmers step up to a broken stick microphone so that they could record some random dialogue.   There's really no need for this game to exist. For Activision Value to have essentially repackaged a bad old game as a bad new game is an obvious and despicable attempt to cash in on the recent military operations going on in the Middle East. Despite this, Delta Ops: Army Special Forces is an awful game that isn't worth your time or money. Avoid it at all costs.  "
560,Granblue Fantasy: Versus,7.0,2,"There isn't a lot of room for newcomers in the fighting game genre. Veteran franchises like Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, and Guilty Gear have dominated the space for years, so the new challengers that do choose to step into the ring usually have the backing of a popular license. Granblue Fantasy Versus is just that kind of rookie fighter; it's based on a property that's incredibly popular in Japan thanks to a successful mobile gacha (virtual capsule-toy vending machine) game with RPG hooks, but relatively unknown everywhere else. Versus is, for all intents and purposes, Granblue Fantasy's debut on the world stage.Developed by Arc System Works--known for excellent fighting game adaptations of Dragon Ball Z and Persona 4--Granblue Fantasy Versus has a strong core thanks to unorthodox gameplay mechanics that delicately balance depth with approachability, while introducing interesting new ideas of its own. The extra flourishes that serve as a nod to fans or aim to adhere to RPG roots whiff on occasion, but the experience as a whole holds its own thanks to the strength of its fundamentals.ArcSys has made strides in improving the approachability of its anime fighters more with simpler inputs and easier-to-understand systems, but for Granblue Fantasy Versus, it has moved away from the breakneck pace, air-dashing-oriented, aggressive playstyle of anime fighters to something more traditional. As a ground-based fighting game, Versus has a much slower pace of play and places heavier focus on normals and special moves instead of partner assists and lengthy touch-of-death combos. In that respect, it can be likened more closely to Capcom fighting games such as Street Fighter. The emphasis is on timing and spacing your attacks properly to create opportunities for follow-ups or set up situations where you have an advantage, but not necessarily an almost guaranteed victory. At a higher level, it's about footsies, precisely executed mixups, smart use of the universal overhead, and the occasional frame trap. For newcomers--of which there's likely to be many, given the popularity of Granblue Fantasy--it's much more stable ground to find footing. Fighting game veterans will naturally have an advantage, but for everyone else, the mountain doesn't seem as steep to climb, so the idea of walking the path to mastery is much more inviting.Auto-combos, a common mechanic in ArcSys games, have been included, which means that a complete newcomer can pick up a controller and press an attack button repeatedly to execute basic combos. These strings of attacks are effective, but limited in damage and applicability without the addition of special moves to a string.And it's here that Granblue Fantasy Versus starts to throw in unique ideas that make for interesting moment-to-moment fighting, but also embody the spirit of how an RPG is played. Special moves are executed in one of two ways, the first being a traditional combination of directional movements and button presses--a quarter-circle forward and attack will, in most cases, execute a projectile if a character has one, for example. However, there are also shortcuts mapped to buttons--you can pull off that same projectile attack with just the press of the R1 button. For every character, special moves are mapped to R1 or R1 plus a directional button. The added layer is, like in an RPG, each of these special moves goes on cooldown after being used, with the length of that cooldown being longer if you use the shortcut to execute it. This is ArcSys' way of balancing out the system so that those who struggle with fighting game inputs can still do cool moves, but players that put in the work are also rewarded for their effort.This system also creates a rather interesting meta-game that lends a degree of unpredictability to fights, especially at higher levels. In most traditional fighting games there are certain tells that provide a keen player with some indication of what is about to happen. Take a charge character like Street Fighter's M. Bison, for example; if you see him shifting one way or another for too long, you know he might unleash a certain special move, and you can try to prepare your next move accordingly. That's not the case in Granblue Fantasy Versus, however, since the shortcut commands can instantly execute special moves.This means that diminutive knight Charlotta can go from walking towards you dragging an a-bit-too-big-for-her sword to launching herself in the air to deliver a crushing overhead blow without needing to charge down back first and give away what she's about to do. And you're left to react in an instant. Similarly, the terrifying behemoth Vaseraga might be a little less scary when he's across the screen, but at any second he could come barreling at you to deliver a devastating shoulder check because of an instant input. The same can be said of every other special move in the game.It sounds like a nightmare to deal with and, admittedly, it can be. But it also creates a really fascinating dynamic that hasn't been explored much in the past. Games like Smash Bros. and Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO also have these kinds of easy input options, but rarely has it factored into the way a game is played as meaningfully as it is in Granblue Fantasy Versus. The cooldown system layered on top of the shortcuts present strategic decision-making moments where you weigh up the pros and cons of using shortcuts versus having an ability temporarily taken out of play and how long it's unavailable for. As with many aspects of fighting games, this early in the game's life it's difficult to pass a definitive judgment on the scope of the systems and mechanics, as the fighting game community often finds new and innovative ways to use techniques, but as it stands, the pieces fit together in a satisfying way even if the bigger picture isn't fully visible.Granblue Fantasy Versus has a robust and intricate set of fighting game mechanics that are easy to get a grasp of and offer plenty of depth to explore for those who keep diggingGranblue Fantasy Versus has a number of other familiar mechanics cherry-picked from across the genre's history. Spot dodging lets attacks be side-stepped with the press of a button, while there are also multiple options for guarding. If directional inputs are used to manually guard high and low, as well as cross-ups, Just Defense is available with proper timing. However, if the dedicated guard button is used, it becomes possible to dash out--and through, in some cases--or dash back. The dedicated guard button also makes blocking cross-ups more consistent, but Just Defense becomes unavailable. Again, Granblue Fantasy Versus asks you to weigh up whether you want to take the easier approach at the cost of some advantages or put in the work for more of a payout. What I've enjoyed most is trying to get my head around using both at the right moment--engaging with the technical side of play when I feel confident, but then switching to the simpler options when I'm feeling overwhelmed or want to be safer. It's kind of like being able to juggle with two balls, but then having a third thrown into the mix; I know how to do it, I just need to coordinate myself better to account for the new variable and get the timing down and the rhythm right. The process of trying to hone the skills needed to do that has been gratifying.All this is to say that, fundamentally, Granblue Fantasy Versus has a robust and intricate set of fighting game mechanics that are easy to get a grasp of and offer plenty of depth to explore for those who keep digging. It's a shame, then, that the game doesn't leverage the intricately designed one-on-one gameplay for its RPG Quest mode, and instead relies on shallow button mashing. Functionally, this mode serves multiple purposes: It introduces those unfamiliar with the franchise to the world and its characters, tells its own unique story, and teaches you the basics of how to play. Sadly, it fails to do any of these in a satisfactory way, while also opting to diminish everything that actually makes it fun to play.Battles in this mode look and feel more like the mobile RPG version of Granblue Fantasy, but it's not turn-based. Instead, you have direct control over characters and must dispatch waves of incoming enemies in something that feels somewhere between a classic side-scrolling beat-em-up and Tekken's Force Mode. However, the enemies present little to no challenge. They also have very little health, so they can usually be offed with a couple of heavy attacks. As a result, there's little reason to use some of Granblue Fantasy Versus' more interesting ideas. Sure, you can use special moves to combat enemies, but why do that when just spamming a single attack button gets the job done? Occasionally, boss characters appear, but they don't force a change in approach--the all-out attack is the smartest and easiest thing to do most of the time.Other members of the fighting game's cast have been corrupted and led astray as part of the game's story, and you encounter them on your journey. To snap them out of their stupor, you've got to give them a beating and, in these encounters, battles take the form of the typical one-on-one fight in Granblue Fantasy Versus. However, these characters are mostly there to be sandbagged so they can be added to your party. The unsatisfying gameplay makes the cliche, forgettable story about a bunch of sky pirates freeing their friends from evil and battling an evil empire even more tiresome to sit through. I really wanted to care about the characters; de facto protagonist Gran has a shounen anime look and charm that I'm partial to. Lowain is a very odd, free-spirited fella with cat ears that calls his mates into battle to take cheeky little shots, and he also summons Yggdrasil, a Primal Beast that's basically a giant lady that bullies his enemies. Then there are archetypes like cool knight Lancelot and arrogant fire boy Percival. As someone who favors charge characters, I really took a shine to Charlotta, who is surprisingly vicious, given her small cutesy design. They all are visually appealing, but the story mode does absolutely nothing for them. Their characterisation is thin at best, in a story that bounces between obtuse and rote. And when the gameplay punctuating this is unrewarding, it's hard to recommend sitting through it.The RPG Quest mode is also where the Granblue Fantasy mobile game's gacha elements appear. You unlock unique weapons for completing the main story quests, but you don't get to actually use any of them. Instead, they all get thrown into what is effectively buckets, and their combined power then raises the attack attributes of your character. Enemies have elemental alignments, and using opposing ones will grant bonus damage, but manually crafting loadouts is time-consuming and unnecessary when an option to automate and optimize exists. There's no real reason to overthink loadouts since elemental alignment is the only major factor at play, so allowing the game to simply put an ideal one together is the best course of action. Ultimately, the gacha elements end up being a throwaway novelty, instead of a valuable wrinkle to gameplay.Granblue Fantasy Versus has a comprehensive suite of training missions that cover everything from basic moves and specials, to advance combos, strategies, and specific mixups. Any and all time spent there is more valuable than in the RPG Quest mode, especially since that's what'll be tested when you head online. Currently, the game's servers aren't as populated as they will be post-launch, but in the time we spent playing online the experience was generally smooth. Occasionally hitches can be attributed to matching up against players outside our local territory, but otherwise there haven't been any disruptive network issues.Granblue Fantasy Versus presents a set of systems that are distinct and unique without putting up unnecessary hurdles for those that are just here to get a Granblue fix. Arc System Works has cleverly meshed RPG and fighting game mechanics, and the way that manifests in the core one-on-one battles is really exciting. In other respects, namely the campaign story mode and its gacha stylings, it leaves a lot to be desired. In bringing Granblue to the wider world, Arc System Works hasn't put its best foot forward, but Versus is definitely a game where you can come for the fantasy and stay for the fighting."
536,Cloudpunk,7.0,2,"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe,"" begins Roy Batty's dying monologue in Blade Runner. In the nearly 40 years since Ridley Scott's film established a visual aesthetic for what would become known as cyberpunk, we've seen these things many times now. Cloudpunk is a complex and uneven narrative-heavy adventure game that trades heavily in cyberpunk cliche. Familiar tropes are rejuvenated with mostly smart writing and consistently striking art direction, but there are also opportunities missed thanks to undernourished, by-the-numbers design.Nivalis is the last city, or at least that's what people say. Towering neon spires thrust out of the climate-ravaged ocean and, eventually, emerge through the clouds; at the top live the privileged few, the self-dubbed CEOs secluded in their stratified penthouses, while underneath everybody else ekes out a living in the dense urban sprawl where every city block has a noodle stand, night is permanent and it's almost always raining. You've seen it all before, of course, yet this well-worn set dressing is rendered in such singular fashion it remains striking throughout.Simply put, Cloudpunk is a stunningly gorgeous game. Nivalis is constructed out of voxels, big chunky bricks of solid colour that give the urban landscape the feel of an enormous, elaborate Lego diorama. Terrific use is made of contrast and lighting. Skyscrapers almost recede into negative space, their facades composed of hundreds of tiny boxes of light, alternating in lurid pinks, yellows and blues. When you're flying through the city in your hover car, each turn delivers a spectacular view, each ascension over a row of high-rises greeted with a dazzling neon-drenched vista. To be honest, this review took longer than it should have because I had to pause every few seconds to snap off another screenshot.Yet it's even better when you get out of your hover car and traverse the city on foot. Here, the camera is locked to a certain view, typically showing a side-on vantage that takes in the street you're running along, with your character often rendered with no more than a tiny handful of voxels in the middle. At first the lack of camera control feels restrictive, but soon the intended purpose becomes clear. Relying on a predefined camera perspective means every shot is designed to best showcase the frequently jaw-dropping environment, with the scale working hand in hand to make you feel even more in awe of it all looming over you. Occasionally the camera zooms in, usually when you venture down a narrow alley, thus replicating the claustrophobic press of the surrounding structures. Other times it'll drop to ground level and tilt up to cinematically frame an event happening in the distance or maybe just to point out--once again--how amazing the city looks. Cloudpunk is constantly tapping you on the shoulder to say, hey, check this out, and at least in terms of postcard material it never fails to disappoint.Inevitably, the reason why you're exploring Nivalis and able to enjoy such breathtaking scenery must suffer from the comparison, so perhaps it's sensible that the character you play is given a prosaic profession. Rania is a courier for Cloudpunk, an illicit delivery company that takes the jobs others refuse. A recent arrival in Nivalis, Rania is working the gig economy in an attempt to shake the Debt Corps. It sounds like a terrible idea to my 2020 ears, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expose the precarity of all labor--especially freelancers--in a capitalist world, but Cloudpunk (the company) seems enlightened to an implausible degree. Rania might have to pay for her hovercar's own gas, but she doesn't have to rely on tips, and if her vehicle is stolen Cloudpunk will replace it at no cost. Not to mention she can somehow afford a spacious studio apartment before she's even worked a day in the job.That job consists of getting a call from Control, the Cloudpunk handler, being assigned a waypoint, and piloting to the required destination. As a cloud city, Nivalis has some worryingly lax ""road"" rules. Rania is free to fly her hover car almost anywhere, weaving through residential complexes and swooping over business parks before touching down on the designated parking zones in each district. Narrow highways get you to her destination faster, but I preferred to take the scenic route.The primary story is told through these jobs, as Rania stumbles into a mystery concerning who or what controls Nivalis, and why it is so clearly falling apart at the seams--literally, in some instances, as another skyscraper collapses, tumbling into the ocean to a collective shrug from a downtrodden population resigned to its fate. As Rania interacts with her handler and Camus, her AI companion (who once embodied a robot dog but now resides in her car, yet still behaves like a dog), and speaks to clients and eventually passengers, you don't get to choose her dialogue options. Conversations are set in stone. Early on, Rania would prefer to keep her head down and not get involved. She just wants to do the job and pay off her debts. Her compassion comes to the fore, though, her wariness subsides, and she develops into a strong voice over the course of the game. I didn't always agree with what she had to say, but it's a credit to the overall calibre of the dialogue that I wanted to keep hearing it and add to my understanding of her take on the world.Even if there aren't choices to be made in dialogue, Rania is presented with a number of binary decisions during certain jobs. These tend to arise from Rania discussing events with Camus and realising there's an alternative to the task she's been given; however, they're not all executed to the same standard. Some feel logical and you totally get why she might think this is a better solution, and some feel suitably urgent as they burden you with newfound dramatic weight. Yet others come across as contrived, as if they're choices for the sake of choices. Regardless, the consequences of all these decisions never match the setup, their underwhelming conclusions usually predictable, though sometimes maddeningly vague, and occasionally downright silly.Indeed, the quality of writing varies wildly across the board. As you'd expect, the central mystery receives most of the attention, though some of the minor characters you can run into throughout the city open up side stories worth investigating. Given Rania's outsider status, issues of cultural memory and appropriation are handled with a deft touch while the core examination of how technology both diminishes and enhances our humanity thankfully goes beyond the basic question of whether robot is human. The writing is at its best when it's focused on people whose situations connect with the wider themes at play in its critique of capitalism. Story threads about corporations automating their labour to endlessly replicate capital to the sole benefit of shareholders, or the drug company releasing a new strain of virus so it can sell the cure it's manufactured, are delivered with a grim wit that transcends cliche.Cloudpunk is at its weakest when inserting knowing references to contemporary culture--Rania's encounter with a ""Debate Me"" dude has its heart in the right place, but it's simply too on-the-nose and fails to find anything relevant or interesting to say beyond the fact that ""Debate Me"" dudes suck. The best-written side character is unfortunately also the one whose questline progress is locked behind the baffling inclusion of collectibles. On balance, though, the good outweighs the bad here, and the real disappointment is that it's such a close call.If the inconsistent writing hints that Cloudpunk isn't entirely sure what type of narrative experience it wants to be, then the addition of a light economic layer betrays a lack of confidence. Money earned from successful jobs must be spent on the odd trip to the gas station to refuel, and can also be put towards a couple of non-essential handling upgrades and cosmetic tweaks to the hover car. Food and drink can be purchased and consumed to give Rania a slight speed boost while a handful of drugs can be bought to make the screen go blurry and little else. There's even a thin trading game where you can buy low and sell high between vendors to maximise profits. But it's all so unnecessary, the impact of any part of this economy so trivial that you're left confused as to why it's there at all. It doesn't actively harm the experience, but it's a distraction you're much better off ignoring completely.Cloudpunk is a game with a single core strength so powerful it alone is sufficient to make it an easy game to recommend. Thanks to the rare beauty and rich atmosphere of its voxel-driven cityscape, Cloudpunk is a constant joy to explore. Whether soaring through the neon-plastered clouds or darting across vertiginous walkways dangling a hundred storeys in the air, the desire remains to keep pushing forward because the next view might be even better. And it usually is. It's not a straightforward case of style over substance, because in Rania and in much of the story there's no lack of substance, but it can feel that way when the style is so disproportionately stellar."
851,Strange Brigade,7.0,2,"While it definitely carries the troubling legacy of colonialism, there's still something indelibly appealing about the adventure genre--which is to say the genre of adventure broadly, not necessarily adventure games. The trek, the hunt, and the questing through ancient ruins all make a compelling foundation for any journey. That spirit is one that Strange Brigade carries well. It cribs iconography and ideas from the likes of Indiana Jones and its thematic kin for a cooperative romp through unknown jungles packed with zombies, magic, and mysteries--all while nailing the fun-loving wanderlust and, unfortunately, flubbing some of the basics.The premise is simple enough: a cooperative third-person shooter where you beat down mythical monstrosities. Often these will take the form of a cadre of mobile, combat-hardened mummies or the legendary Minotaur. Your mission, as given to you by the English secret service, is to conquer these foes and help lay to rest the soul of a millennia-old queen whose spirit rampages through the region.Your crew of four is a raucous bunch, each with their own thematically-appropriate skills and story. Tough-talking Gracie, for instance, provides the industrious muscle for the squad, and Frank is the experienced leader. The pair of magicians include the classically styled Archimedes and the vaguely racist Nalangu, an amalgam of tribalist stereotypes of indigenous shamans and warriors that does Strange Brigade no favors. To be fair, there's little hint of mean-spirit in Strange Brigade itself; it's more a natural consequence of the genre and a failure to adequately or actively push back against some of those tropes. Problematic elements aside, there's plenty of stylized presentation and jovial pomp to keep you entertained--though you'd be more than forgiven to not overlook those touchy aspects, too.Beyond its setting, it can be a bit tough to nail down what precisely Strange Brigade does that stands out. Gunplay is straightforward, as are its foes--most of whom are either big baddies or swarms of mooks. But the '30s radio serial tone actually works well to create a solid premise for its better elements. Traps and puzzles feel like logical extensions, and the cooperative nature helps you better manage the chaos. While you've no doubt mowed down your share of zombies while an NPC scrambles to unlock a door, shifting that role to another player adds a little something extra. When those panicked shouts come through the headset, you feel imminently responsible for your friend's safety and they trust that you'll have their back.All of this works with the game's relatively straightforward inventory system. Alongside the spread of traps and obstacles throughout the stage to create an unusual method of traversing and battling, an array of bonuses and upgrades encourage traversal of these branching worlds. You can, and are encouraged to, for instance, manipulate traps to squash, pierce, and dismember teeming hordes of monsters. These battles play out in labyrinthine stages, too, offering a few different ways to guide and control enemies along the way. Everyone in the group will get a chance to flex their skills and contribute at some point.While the variety of locales is a bit limited--they're all Egyptian-themed to a degree--there's quite a bit of variability within that. Desert areas offer much more open battle spaces than the caverns of an ancient tomb, which will funnel you through cramped passages packed with swinging axe blades and pressure-plate flamethrowers. All-told, you can spend upwards of 10 hours exploring each of them with a crew, and while they're all a bit similar, they don't wear out their welcome too soon.Each character will have items and supplies they can buy with the loot they collect along the way, and all carry a magical amulet that can absorb the spirits of the baddies they've conquered to unleash super-charged attacks. Other gear, like specialized and temporary weapons--akin to the turrets or miniguns you might be able to wield in more traditional shooters for a time--help break up the pacing a bit more, and offer up a few more chances to coordinate with the team.Despite the extra fluff, it's hard to shake the sense that Strange Brigade isn't much more than a snack. The tongue-in-cheek tone and setting are the big draws here, and while they facilitate some unusual and entertaining play, they don't do much beyond that. Puzzles are dreadfully simple--bouncing between connect-the-pipes and basic matching games--and upgrades just don't provide a lot to play around with. Each weapon has a few slots, but even that's plug-and-play. For such an unusual world, more types of attacks, weapons, foes, would be a joy. And, unfortunately, what's there does have some significant technical problems. Texture pop-in can be jarring, and a bevy of other problems like clipping issues and uneven loot distribution give the impression that parts of Strange Brigade are in need for further refinement.The grand result is an amusing adventure that makes a powerful case for more creativity with level design, setting, and pacing in co-op shooters, without thoroughly capitalizing on all of its own best ideas. Traps and their extensive use within many of the levels are a joy, and the underpinning gunplay is strong enough to warrant a sturdy recommendation, but it all comes to a head well before it should."
2670,Ridge Racer Unbounded,8.0,2,"   MotorStorm: Apocalypse and Split/Second; the slow-motion takedowns are those of Burnout; and the fast-paced multiplayer action is akin to Blur's. But it's thrown together with a great deal of care. Your cars are varied, plentiful, and oh so shiny. You can pick from all manner of machines, some faster and lighter, others stronger and better in the drift. All have a unique look that mimics real-world classics, yet they retain the pseudo-futuristic style that Ridge Racer is famed for.      Their handling is a blend of old and new too. Drifting still plays its part, but gone is the on-rails feel of old, replaced with a much more dynamic and exciting system that rewards careful timing of the hand brake and judicious tweaks of the steering to make it around corners. Overdo the steering, and you slam straight into a wall. Undercook it, and you won't even make it around the bend. Put simply, you can't coast through drifts anymore. This makes them more challenging, but the rewards for such skilful manoeuvres are greater than before.      The boost bar that fills during drifts isn't just for bursts of speed; it's your primary weapon of destruction. Competitors can be turned into twisted heaps of metal with a well-timed boost to the rear, resulting in spectacular--if overly long--slow-motion wipeouts of flame and shrapnel. Buildings that stand in the way of a straight path down the track are ripe for your boosts too, exploding with a vigour that propels you out the other side in a display of broken glass and rubble that would be worthy of any great action movie.        Such displays of destruction are not only a treat for the eyes, but a key to your success. For every car you wreck, building you destroy, or lamppost you topple, there are points to be won. Even if you don't take a podium place during an event--though there is a bonus for doing so--your time on the circuit isn't wasted: the points you earn from destruction go towards increasing your overall racing level, which opens up new districts (tracks) in Shatter Bay, new cars, and new events. They include Domination races that reward destruction, Shindo races that reward pure racing skill, Drift Attacks that reward your ability to go sideways, and Frag Attacks that reward smashing your opponents into a wall.     Districts you unlock give each event a new lease on life, such is their variety. The dusty, crate-filled roads and tight turns of the Docks area soon give way to the towering concrete skyscrapers of the inner city, with drift-friendly roads, explosive trucks, and mesmerizing jumps making them a joy to race through. The outer city brings with it highways and tight tunnels for close-quarters shunting, while the addition of nighttime races adds more beauty to the already finely crafted and detailed tracks. Performance is good too, even on modest systems, but there's a disappointing lack of graphics options--you have to rely on your graphics card drivers for any tweaks you want to make. A minimal HUD consisting of just a speedometer ensures you're given an unobstructed view of the city; finer details like position, lap times, and score are cleverly overlaid onto the environment itself.     There's a case to be made for the cleverness of the multiplayer too, which shuns a traditional lobby-based system for something altogether more personal. A track-creation system lets you craft circuit events to place within a city hub of your very own. You can set a score in any of your events and send it out to the world as a challenge, or grab a group of would-be competitors and go head-to-head in action-packed online races. It's a shame the track editor isn't a little easier to use, due to its flaky camera navigation and confusing tools for placing tunnels, but the resulting circuit designs already add a great deal of longevity to a game that has no shortage of tracks right out of the box. That's not to mention the sheer joy of fragging other players just as they're about to reach the finish line in first place, leaving them to wallow in a fiery mess of machine.        And really, that's what Unbounded excels at: balls-to-the wall, explosive action. Truth be told, it's Ridge Racer by name only and a massive departure from previous games in the series. But there's so much to like here, so much joy to be had fragging your opponents, so much creativity to be poured into the track creator, and so much stupid satisfaction to be had from blowing stuff up that you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to dismiss Unbounded just because it doesn't handle like you're used to, or because Reiko isn't there to mentally undress during loading screens. Ridge Racer Unbounded is much more exciting than that, and much more compelling than anything that has come before. There's no point in looking back. Instead, celebrate the fact that you've got a brighter, sleeker, and more explosion-filled Ridge Racer. It's one hell of a ride.  "
3769,Monster Madness,5.0,1,"  Released last year for the PC and Xbox 360, Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia tried to dress up the fun of classic top-down arcade games such as Gauntlet in the trappings of a schlocky monster movie. But a host of issues, including lousy pacing and imprecise controls, made the game itself feel pretty schlocky. Now a revamped version of the game, complete with a new subtitle, is out on the PlayStation 3. But despite a few nice improvements, Monster Madness: Grave Danger is an awkward, tedious game.          The core game in Grave Danger is very similar to that of the original release. It tells the tale of four teenagers--a geek, a skater, a goth girl, and a cheerleader, all as stereotypical as can be--who find themselves fending for their lives against a massive invasion of ghosts, goblins, skeletons, zombies, and countless other denizens of the underworld. The game relies heavily on pop-culture references for its attempts at humor, riffing on everything from Superman II to Homestar Runner, and although it may occasionally get a chuckle out of you, most of the jokes fall flat. But the story isn't of much importance here anyway, given that it only provides the flimsiest of excuses for all of the action, and, really, how much of an excuse do you need to cut down zombies with a gun that shoots CDs? At least the comic-book style cutscenes that the game occasionally employs look pretty good.     When the game begins, you pick your teen and head into the fray. Although each character specializes in a different type of melee weapon, the differences between them are almost entirely cosmetic, which feels like a bit of a missed opportunity to add some replay value to the game. For a while, you'll find yourself hacking your way through the enemy onslaught with melee weapons such as swords, hockey sticks, and batons, and this quickly gets boring. The combat just isn't varied or precise enough to stay interesting for long, and the enemies are bone stupid to boot. The game tries to make up for this by throwing them at you in large numbers, but this just means that you have to spend more time whaling on the attack button to chop them all down, maybe tossing in an occasional dodge for good measure.      However, before too long the game introduces ranged weapons, which are a bit more fun. Throughout the game, you'll employ a nice variety of ranged weapons, from nail guns to shotguns to flamethrowers, and this is where one of this version's most significant improvements over the original release comes into play. Ranged combat is now controlled with a dual-stick shooter control scheme, and it's such a natural fit for the game that it's a bit mind-boggling that the developers didn't think to include it previously. It's totally intuitive and helps contribute to the old-school arcade action feel that the game is targeting.      Although this improvement is much-needed, it isn't enough to compensate for the game's other lingering issues. Grave Danger, like its predecessor, lacks any sense of pacing, and some battles go on for far too long. One battle on a rooftop near the game's end is positively interminable. And when the game does try to break up all of the hacking and shooting a bit, it frequently does so with a fetch quest that's far less interesting than the combat that it's serving to interrupt. To add insult to injury, you'll often undertake these fetch quests at the behest of a leprechaun whose horrible Irish accent just might be the scariest thing about this game. You'll also encounter numerous vehicle sequences, and though a few of these vehicles, such as a swan boat and mech suits, are mildly enjoyable, most of them are just sluggish and cumbersome. All in all, the game overstays its welcome by a good, long while, stretching its simple gameplay out across 12 hours or so, with each successive level feeling like more of the same. When goth girl Carrie says, in that sarcastic way of hers, ""Wonderful, more trudging through sewers and dungeons,"" you'll know just how she feels.           Like the original Monster Madness, the game also feels very unbalanced, though this isn't quite the impediment that it was in Battle for Suburbia, which could be downright punishing at times and had a checkpoint system that exacerbated the problem. Rather than addressing the balance issues in any kind of meaningful way, Grave Danger simply does away with the checkpoint system altogether and replaces it with one in which you are instantly respawned whenever you die, losing only a few of the monster tokens that serve as the game's currency as a penalty. This takes what was a frustratingly difficult game and saps it of all challenge, which feels less like a solution and more like a cop-out. You'll still die a lot, and it's still a drag. It's understandable that the developers would want to tone down the challenge somewhat to make the game more accessible, but an actual adjustment of the game's balance could have resulted in a far more satisfying gameplay experience.         The pace, balance, and overall enjoyment is improved somewhat if you have some friends tagging along with you, and the game's other big improvement makes playing with friends much easier: The campaign can now be played online with up to four players. Of course, the online functionality isn't without its quirks; on a few occasions while attempting to join a game, we got stuck on a loading screen and had to restart the console. But once you're in a game with other players, it works fine. Monster Madness feels like a game that was designed from the ground up to be played in groups, and playing the game alone feels not only unbalanced, but also oddly lonely by comparison. When you've got two to four players going at it, the screen fills up with monster-slaying mayhem in ways that the single-player experience can't match. The massive carnage of a multiplayer game is definitely a good thing, but as in Battle for Suburbia, the game's camera doesn't always seem able to handle that much action, and you'll sometimes find yourself as little more than a distant speck in the background, unable to tell where you're aiming or if you're hitting anything.       Grave Danger also includes 25 new single-player challenges, many of which consist of typical monster-killing fare like what you find throughout the campaign. The slightly more interesting challenges are the minigames, such as a home-run contest, a simple rhythm game, and a knock-off of the card game Concentration in which you must match identical monsters. Playing through these games will appeal to folks interested in unlocking all the character costumes, but aside from that, the challenges aren't compelling enough to add any real value to the package.The game also includes competitive online multiplayer for up to 12 people in modes such as Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and Capture the Flag. These modes work well enough, provided that you know a bunch of people who are willing to play them with you. Don't expect to find many public competitive online games. That scene is deader than the rotting corpses you'll slaughter throughout the game.         Graphically, Monster Madness is unimpressive from a technical viewpoint. The camera generally maintains a good distance from the action so that things have a clean, sharp appearance, but when the camera pulls in, a lack of detail in the character models and environments becomes apparent. Nevertheless, Monster Madness' focus is on tossing scads of monsters on the screen at once, and in that regard, the game performs well. There's also an evocative sense of style to the game's levels that makes up a bit for the technical shortcomings of the visuals. The park, high school, and shopping mall areas successfully suggest an ""Anytown, USA"" kind of setting. Sadly, it's hard to find much of anything kind to say about the game's sound. The music is generic, the voice acting isn't very good, and you'll hear the same obnoxious screams and taunts from your enemies so many times that you may wonder if the game is actually trying to drive you insane.        Compared to the original game, Monster Madness: Grave Danger is definitely an improvement overall, thanks to the vastly superior shooting controls and the ability to play the campaign online. However, these improvements aren't enough to actually make the game worth your time, and those who have played the original game will be puzzled at some of the omissions and awkward design choices in this version. Taken entirely on its own terms, Monster Madness: Grave Danger is an extremely repetitive, frequently tedious game that feels less like a nostalgic throwback to classic top-down arcade shooters and more like an exercise in dated gameplay styles that would have been better left in the past.            The pace, balance, and overall enjoyment is improved somewhat if you have some friends tagging along with you, and the game's other big improvement makes playing with friends much easier: The campaign can now be played online with up to four players. Of course, the online functionality isn't without its quirks; on a few occasions while attempting to join a game, we got stuck on a loading screen and had to restart the console. But once you're in a game with other players, it works fine. Monster Madness feels like a game that was designed from the ground up to be played in groups, and playing the game alone feels not only unbalanced, but also oddly lonely by comparison. When you've got two to four players going at it, the screen fills up with monster-slaying mayhem in ways that the single-player experience can't match. The massive carnage of a multiplayer game is definitely a good thing, but as in Battle for Suburbia, the game's camera doesn't always seem able to handle that much action, and you'll sometimes find yourself as little more than a distant speck in the background, unable to tell where you're aiming or if you're hitting anything.      Grave Danger also makes a number of other changes, minor and major, to Monster Madness. The nuts, bolts, screws, holy grails, and various other doohickeys that you need to assemble the game's ranged weapons are now gathered in tool boxes rather than scattered around the levels, which cuts down on exploration time. Characters can also be upgraded now with special gear that improves health, ammo capacity, movement speed, and the like, though this doesn't change the fact that all four characters are essentially identical. They all have the same bonuses available to them; one character's duct-tape bag is another's utility belt. Furthermore, the game's bestiary feature, which provided details about all of the monsters you've encountered, has been removed. It didn't add anything to the gameplay, but it was a neat bonus for monster enthusiasts, and seeing as how the vast, comically designed assortment of creatures that populate the game is one of its best assets, it's hard to comprehend what the reasoning could be for the bestiary's removal.   More significantly, the game cuts a few chase sequences and boss battles from the campaign. Some of these edits are seamless, so you'll miss them only if you've played the original game, but some stick out like a sore thumb. For instance, at one point an extremely evil garbage truck shows up, and you hop in your buggy, conveniently parked at a freeway onramp, clearly setting the stage for a desperate escape. In the original game, a desperate escape does indeed ensue. But here, the game jumps to the next level without so much as a mention of the garbage truck that was bearing down on you just a moment before. It's awkward and calls attention to the fact that some content is missing from this version.   Grave Danger also includes 25 new single-player challenges, many of which consist of typical monster-killing fare like what you find throughout the campaign. The slightly more interesting challenges are the minigames, such as a home-run contest, a simple rhythm game, and a knock-off of the card game Concentration in which you must match identical monsters. Meeting certain goals in each game unlocks a new costume for your characters, so completionists may feel compelled to play all of them until they've acquired all of the outfits. Aside from that, the challenges aren't compelling enough on their own to add any real value to the package. The game also includes competitive online multiplayer for up to 12 people in modes such as Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and Capture the Flag. These modes work well enough, provided that you know a bunch of people who are willing to play them with you. Don't expect to find many public competitive online games. That scene is deader than the rotting corpses you'll slaughter throughout the game.    Graphically, Monster Madness is unimpressive from a technical viewpoint. The camera generally maintains a good distance from the action so that things have a clean, sharp appearance, but when the camera pulls in, a lack of detail in the character models and environments becomes apparent. Nevertheless, Monster Madness' focus is on tossing scads of monsters on the screen at once, and in that regard, the game performs well. There's also an evocative sense of style to the game's levels that makes up a bit for the technical shortcomings of the visuals. The park, high school, and shopping mall areas successfully suggest an ""Anytown, USA"" kind of setting. Sadly, it's hard to find much of anything kind to say about the game's sound. The music is generic, the voice acting isn't very good, and you'll hear the same obnoxious screams and taunts from your enemies so many times that you may wonder if the game is actually trying to drive you insane.         Compared to the original game, Monster Madness: Grave Danger is definitely an improvement overall, thanks to the vastly superior shooting controls and the ability to play the campaign online. However, these improvements aren't enough to actually make the game worth your time, and those who have played the original game will be puzzled at some of the omissions and awkward design choices in this version. Taken entirely on its own terms, Monster Madness: Grave Danger is an extremely repetitive, frequently tedious game that feels less like a nostalgic throwback to classic top-down arcade shooters and more like an exercise in dated gameplay styles that would have been better left in the past.

3344,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,6.0,1,"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed took a fine game and turned it into a technical mess. The Force Unleashed II takes a lesser game and delivers it in a perfectly playable state. This may come as a relief to players that suffered through the original's performance difficulties, but truth be told, this sequel isn't much of a step forward. Rather, it is less enjoyable, less varied, and shorter than the game that came before it. The art design, while not very diverse, is still impressive, and the story, while not always emotionally convincing, is still dotted with poignant moments. But the frustrations of the original haven't been improved in any meaningful ways, and an incredibly bland final boss battle brings a decent action game to a limp conclusion. The Force Unleashed II has none of the spark or diversity of the first game, and though it isn't as technically troublesome, it harbors some bizarre bugs of its own.          The story is The Force Unleashed II's first notable element. On the watery planet of Kamino, Darth Vader hovers over a familiar figure. It looks to be Starkiller, the original game's leading man and Vader's unauthorized apprentice. But is it really Starkiller--the one said to have sacrificed himself for the Rebellion? Thus, you step into this man's shoes and begin your search for the truth, not to mention the search for Juno Eclipse, Starkiller's former pilot and lover. Excellent voice acting and facial animations give cutscenes emotional impact, and a sequence near the end of the game in which you are plagued by visions is a great touch that melds storytelling with gameplay. It's unfortunate that a lengthy central stretch that focuses on the combat needs of the Rebellion brings the narrative to a halt. It's also unfortunate that you may encounter broken cinematics that play audio and display subtitles over a dark screen. This common glitch is disappointing, given that the story, while not up to the standards of its predecessor, is both fitting and fulfilling. This is in part because it harks back to the original Star Wars trilogy, in which the action was not gratuitous but was granted context by human emotion and complicated relationships.     The game's art design is the other standout facet. On the world of Cato Neimodia, a rich color palette of gold, orange, and red makes an opulent palace come alive. In the final hour, the lights of looming edifices punctuate the murk. As in the first game, striking lighting and painted textures give many of your surroundings a warm, lush look. It's unfortunate that the drawn-out middle section squanders The Force Unleashed II's good looks as much as it squanders the story. The hangars and hallways capture the Imperial vibe, but the lack of diversity will have you missing the temple on Coruscant, the junkyards of Raxus Prime, and the fungal jungles of Felucia--all beautiful and prominent locations featured in the first game. A visit to an important planet in the Star Wars canon may have you excited to explore its humid regions, but there's little gameplay here, and you end up flying away to far less interesting places. A great deal of artistry went into making these locales leap off the screen, and it's regrettable that many of them are so similar that one bleeds right into the next.         The lack of variety extends beyond the game's environments. While The Force Unleashed featured Jawas, Wookies, Felucian skullblades, Rodian rippers, drones, scrap creatures, and more (in addition to the expected troops and walkers), this sequel relies heavily on the same few enemies, repeated over and over again. Armed with your dual sabers and some of the same basic Force powers of the original, you leave behind a trail of stormtroopers, AT-ST walkers, and other trooper and walker variants. You do so by slashing them with your dual lightsabers, zapping them with Force lightning, flinging them back with Force push, and using Force grip to fling objects and enemies around. The powerful physics are still impressive to behold as you toss around barrels and grab TIE fighters out of the air, as is using Force repulse to clear away a crowd of menacing robotic spiders. However, like in the original, the targeting is still imprecise, though less maddeningly so. You can now lock the camera on to a particular enemy, but this pointless addition is of absolutely no help. You still grab objects other than those you intend, and you still fling junk in directions other than that of your target. And as before, the camera might insist on an unhelpful view in linear environments, of which there are more in this outing.      The Force Unleashed II adds a few new abilities to your repertoire. One is Force sense, which is a guidance system that directs you to your objective and negates the need for a map. Another is mind trick, which confuses humanoid enemies and causes them to attack their comrades. However, neither skill is as game changing as the grapple, in which the camera zooms in while you get a good look at the powerful attack. This is cool the first few times, but the same few canned animations lose their edge quickly. Another drawback is that it grappling often works as a win button, allowing you to dash around and exterminate your humanoid foes without much resistance. The final drawback is that in one of the two grapple types, the animations break when you try to deliver a final saber slash, causing your foe to teleport back to the ground.         You can simply avoid the move if you want a greater challenge, but if you stick to standard tactics, you might get frustrated. The game tries to vary the combat by mixing up enemies in different combinations, making for annoying battles in which you face acolytes resistant to Force powers and heavy troopers resistant to lightsaber attacks at once, all while a robot spews flames at you or a couple of walkers fire missiles at you. It's nice that you can deflect those missiles or grab and fling them back, but when you're dealing with a half-dozen other enemies that might temporarily stun you on top of the ranged attacks, you stop feeling like a powerful Jedi, and the combat stops being fun. That's especially true when you want to grab an incoming rocket in the heat of battle and seize some meaningless object instead.      There are a few thrilling set-piece sections to enjoy, such as those in which you hurtle toward the ground, avoiding debris or Force pushing it out of the way. Boss fights, on the other hand, don't have the same driving momentum. A boss battle versus a hulking monstrosity is frustrating due to a limited camera, invisible walls, and unpredictable collision detection. It also drags on and on, which makes it seem like it was meant to pad the campaign's five-hour length. (Luckily, this same fight ends with a fantastic cinematic tour de force that makes the tedium almost worth it.) The final encounter is similarly protracted and perhaps the blandest chore in the game. This battle is unthinkably easy, having you perform the same exact actions over and over again for upward of 10 minutes and never requiring you to mix up techniques. It comes directly after an overlong and boring platforming sequence that dissolves any tension the game may have accumulated to this point. It's a disappointing end to a game that never reaches its potential.         Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II at least performs better than the original game did on the PC, but it doesn't improve on any of its core mechanics. That's unfortunate because the core combat is fun. It's a thrill to fling your foes into dangerous force fields and to zap jumptroopers with lightning and watch them uncontrollably zip around. And while the story isn't as affecting as the original's, great voice acting and cinematics (at least, the ones that work) help it make an impression nonetheless. Yet with less enjoyable boss battles, less environmental variety, and more enemy repetition, this sequel is a missed opportunity. Perhaps you can't get enough Force Unleashed; in that case, you could always return to the game wearing one of the unlockable costumes or try out some of the unlockable challenge rooms, which are timed combat scenarios of disparate quality. But Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II is too predictable and glitchy to inspire extended play time.      "
1556,N++,8.0,2,"N++ explaining the main premise. You’re a ninja, and the goal is to escape a neverending series of deadly traps, with naught but a floaty jump button at your disposal, while making off with all the gold you can. It sounds like a hectic, crazy mission, especially considering that the stages come at you with everything they’ve got, including lasers, missiles, lightning, and drones of all shapes, sizes, and intelligence. Your only real weapon is the sheer force of momentum itself. But the secret to success in N++ isn’t to hyperventilate and sharpen your twitch reflexes but to find your zen, that place of unshakable equilibrium, of comfort with the controls, the knowledge of how the world will react to your every move and how you will respond in kind. It’s the same sense of zen that most people can associate with going on a long drive, a contextual, situational awareness of the vehicle you’re in, what it’s capable of doing and not doing, the road ahead, and the other vehicles around you. It’s the point where you’re no longer fighting the rules of the world around you but flourishing within it. There’s an ebb and flow to every stage, a rhythm to every trap, every projectile, every time your tiny stick-figure ninja jumps through the air. Your average platformer presents an obstacle at each turn, expecting a specific utilization of the tools at your disposal to surmount. In N++, it’s more akin to the game teaching you to do a kinetic dance each and every time. That isn’t to say that N, now in its third iteration, has become any less of a challenge. It’s still a game that’s definitely not going to coddle you on your neverending journey to the holy doorway out of each stage, and the portions have never been more daunting, with 100+ puzzles built right into the game and an infinite sprawl of new stages available through the level editor--some built for pure evil and others as a showcase of pure Rube Goldberg genius. However, the learning curve has a much more gentle gradation this time around. The game’s background, once a grayscale matrix pattern, can now be shifted into a number of contrasts and colors. Most are just cool, though a couple (like a certain pink one) are weirdly nauseating. Even the music, once a pulsing, pounding, insistent heartbeat, is now mostly a mix of chilled trance and tense, moody trip-hop. It’s a game that’s inviting you to the peace at its center instead of taunting you to come get it. The first trophy you ever get is the game’s ethos in a nutshell: “You Suck, but That’s Okay.” Veterans know this, and there isn't much here to surprise anyone who's been through the wringer with N+. But the game doesn't have to surprise you. Instead, N++ is more of a refinement for a series that’s always felt like an ongoing statement of purpose more than a full game, despite the sheer number of puzzles pre-loaded. The game still feels a little on the slight side. Aside from high scores and the mere satisfaction, there’s not really an impetus for the average player to go chasing after the harder bits of gold scattered throughout the stage, especially when much of the same satisfaction can be had just from reaching the goal to begin with. Instead, it remains just as it has been, a strange sort of gaming meditation, sharpening skills that definitely have applications elsewhere in one’s gaming life. Try playing this for a half hour and then try beating the harder obstacle course stages in Rayman Legends. The same principles work like magic. Still, the purity of N++ is still its greatest appeal, a stripped-down representation of the skills that many gamers have come to know as innate, given free reign in some of the best level design ideas in the industry. N++ may represent an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” sort of expansion, but the exhilaration that it continues to offer speaks to the idea that it may have been perfect to begin with."
808,SoulCalibur VI,8.0,2,"What truly distinguishes SoulCalibur from its genre contemporaries is a pervading sense of adventure. It tells a grand tale of knights and ninjas, axe-wielding goliaths and pirate warriors, all struggling over mythical weapons of good and evil. It accents this with a rousing orchestral score and grandiose narrations about entwined destinies and inescapable fates. Sure, deep and rewarding mechanics are at the heart of every good fighting game--and SoulCalibur VI certainly has that--but for this series, adventure has always been the soul.That spirit of adventure is most evident in SoulCalibur VI's two story modes. Libra of Souls is the meatier of the two and takes inspiration from SoulCalibur II's beloved Weapon Master Mode. It's part fighting game, part role-playing game, part Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign; you create and customize your own unique fighter using options that, while serviceable, aren't nearly as robust as the ones in Bandai Namco's other fighter, Tekken 7. From there you embark on a journey that will take you across the world, and along the way you'll cross paths--and swords--with both named characters and generically named bit-parters.Libra of Souls tells its story primarily through text, but it's all surprisingly engaging, with dialogue and descriptions setting the stage for the inevitable fight and giving even its throwaway opponents a bit of flavour. The story's conceit for making you travel around the world is that you're ""malfested"" with an evil energy and must absorb Astral Fissures to stay alive. Although you're ushered between main quest missions, various side-quests pop up around you, with NPCs asking for a hand solving their problems. Naturally, the solution each time is a sword-swinging contest, but the game does a valiant job of world building along the way to give texture to its fantasy universe. You'll learn that Ceylon is a major producer of cinnamon, which is favoured by royalty and thus very precious, and that hamlets are being decimated by a rampaging Azure Knight with a thirst for souls. You'll meet a would-be entrepreneur who, while affable, is mostly after handouts; a weaponsmith who is looking to impress the royal family to win a contract; and a priestess who doubts her abilities, among others.Completing these missions rewards you with experience that levels you up, and this is where the RPG hooks are strongest. As you grow, you'll be able to use stronger weapons that have different visual styles and properties. Enemies also become hardier and, on top of that, special battle conditions spice up fights. These may make one type of attack more effective while decreasing the strength of others, thus forcing you to diversify your skillset within the battle system. Another wrinkle to the RPG mechanics is the ability to select a food item to take into battle. These bestow bonuses such as increased counter damage, a boost to health at the start of a new round, or extra experience for a win, to name a few. If you’d rather let someone else do the dirty work, you can visit the Mercenaries Guild and hire a fighter, outfit them with a weapon and food, then send them into battle. At best the AI will secure a victory; at worst they’ll knock off some health from the enemy before you step in.There are also little touches in Libra of Souls that reinforce the idea that you're a wandering warrior on an epic journey. One of them is an indicator at the top of the world map that ticks down the years as you progress, establishing a passage of time as you bounce between locations and fights in rapid succession. Another is the decision-making moments, some of which will simply dictate how you act towards a character, while others will weigh your soul towards good or evil, impact the story, and decide how the ending battle plays out. The eventual consequence of your actions is small, but it's a neat way to give you a tiny bit of authorship in the story.The main issue with Libra of Souls is the ratio of storytelling to actual gameplay. The mode is very text-heavy, which would be less of a problem if its battles weren't so quick. In the hands of a capable fighting game player, many enemies can be dispatched within as little as 10 seconds, which means time spent in Libra of Souls is heavily skewed toward reading over fighting. And although the loading screens before and after battles are quite short, they can become increasingly tedious. The mode is also lacking in variety, so beyond the occasional battle condition, it does very little to keep you on your toes. For the most part, applying an aggressive strategy will see you emerge victorious.The second mode, Soul Chronicles, is a more typical take on a fighting game story but is still expansive and has an interesting approach to laying out its narrative. It features a main story that chronicles what happens with the legendary Soul Edge but supplements this with 19 character-specific campaigns, drilling down on what they're doing while the broader story takes place. Although they're heavily reliant on static artwork, they're fully voiced and the artwork itself has an eye-catching, sketch-like style. There's a microcosm of Libra of Souls' issues here too, though, as battles can be over in the blink of an eye, and that means more hitting buttons to advance text.Nevertheless, Libra of Souls and Soul Chronicle make for a satisfying single-player offering, with the former lasting upwards of eight hours and the latter taking around four. Idiosyncrasies aside, both give you plenty to do and provide a comprehensive, engrossing story throughout. By the time it's over, you'll have travelled the world, met a variety of colorful characters, and fought all manner of strange creatures. Quite the adventure.SoulCalibur VI doesn't demand hours of study and experimentation ... you can pick up a controller and feel like you're competent in no timeThe beauty of SoulCalibur's gameplay is its simplicity, and in that respect SoulCalibur VI is a bit like rock-paper-scissors. At its most superficial, the rules of engagement are simple and the pace of battles means decision-making is based on instinct as much as considered tactics and being reactive. Admittedly, the same can be said of most fighting games, but unlike them SoulCalibur VI doesn't demand hours of study and experimentation to do this; you can pick up a controller and feel like you're competent in no time. Although there are complicated systems and techniques to consider, an inability to interact with them doesn't loom over you. Before long vertical attacks will reveal themselves as powerful but slow, you'll quickly realise that horizontal attacks interrupt sidesteps and are a safe way to apply pressure, and kicks are a nice balance of the two but with limited range. It takes little time to internalize those fundamentals, and so their intricacies become apparent quicker than in most fighting games. Throw in blocking and movement, both of which are intuitive, and the pick-up-and-play factor becomes a key strength of SoulCalibur VI.The surface simplicity belies more complex systems beneath, and SoulCalibur VI is mechanically dense. It layers systems from throughout the series on top of each other so even veterans will need to examine the individual pieces and figure out how they fit together. Although each character has a relatively limited range of attacks, the eight-way run movement lets you modify them. Attacks also land at different heights--high, mid, and low--and in turn blocking becomes a three-tiered system. More confident players can react to an attack by executing a last-second Guard Impact to repel and leave their opponent open, but a staggered player can retaliate with a Reversal Impact--a reversal reversal.From there it only gets more complicated. Reversal Edge is a special stance that will counter incoming attacks at any height. It's executed with a single button and the longer it's held the more attacks it can absorb. This makes defending against an onslaught of attacks really easy, but the ease of execution means it also steps on the toes of the more skill-based Guard Impact. Reversal Edge seems to be aimed at casual players as, while a successful Guard Impact places the initiator in a more advantageous position, Reversal Edge establishes a neutral playfield by initiating a clash. Here the action slows, the camera swoops in close, and the two fighters effectively bet on what the other player will do and counter it. This is a useful way to create some breathing room when being smothered, but the guessing game leads to a feeling of randomness that can be frustrating. The workaround here is to land an unblockable break attack to stop a Reversal Edge.Beyond that there are Critical Edges, which are the game's equivalent of super moves. These are governed by the Soul Gauge, which is built up by attacking, defending, and taking damage. Once one level is attained, it can be spent on executing an incredibly powerful and outlandish cinematic attack. A Soul Gauge can also be spent on a Soul Charge, a comeback state of sorts that opens a separate set of moves up for a character to use, powers up normal attacks, and makes them cause damage to blocking opponents for a brief period.Those are just a few of the systems in SoulCalibur VI, so for those that want to become students of the game, it offers plenty to learn. However, at times it can also feel needlessly complex. This is likely a symptom of creating a collection of systems that give the hardcore fighting game players the depth they crave while also enabling casual players to stand their ground against them. On paper that might seem like a good approach, but the end result is a construction that is at odds with itself, as if built out of both K-Nex and Lego--the simpler parts undermine the complex ones, and although it works, it's inelegant. A good player with an understanding of all the systems will almost always triumph over someone only making use of the basic ones, so the biggest issue this superfluousness presents is that it makes the path from casual to expert a little less appealing to walk. That complexity is overwhelming when it doesn't need to be, and if there are simpler and easier options there's less incentive to dig beneath the surface.As with most fighting games, it'll be some time before overly powerful characters or dubious strategies emerge online, if at all. However, from a network perspective SoulCalibur VI's online modes are stable. We played a number of matches online in ranked and casual and had no trouble finding other players, connecting, and having smooth fights. In casual mode, you can search for a room based on customizable parameters such as skill level, round count, region, and language. You can also specify if custom characters are allowed. Alternatively, you can establish your own room and invite others to join or have it open to anyone.In ranked mode you select your character and style from a pop-up menu, forgoing the need to go into the game's normal selection screen. There's also the option to pick connection status, region, and preferred starting side, for those that want it. If you're looking to learn and refine your skills, the replay channel is handy for rewatching your own saved matches, as well as finding recent replays from the community to favorite and watch. A nice touch is the ability to see who won the match, so if you want to see how to play a character successfully it's easy to do so. Overall, SoulCalibur VI's online suite is fairly no-frills, sticking to the basics but doing them well.SoulCalibur VI is a fighting game that's easy to recommend. Like all the best titles in the genre, it has a low barrier to entry and high skill ceiling. For those looking to get in a few games with friends it's welcoming and immediately enjoyable. For those committed to ploughing the depths of its systems to get tournament ready, it has plenty to unpack and understand. Better still, those that want to play alone will find SoulCalibur VI has some of the most substantial single-player content in any fighting game today."
2464,Ratchet &amp; Clank: Full Frontal Assault,7.0,2,"All 4 One, Ratchet and Clank continue their foray into multiplayer-focused action with Full Frontal Assault. There isn't a whole lot to this game; it's narrow in scope and priced accordingly. Here, the focus is on competitive multiplayer, and the one and only such mode requires you to balance making tactical decisions with blasting lots of things to smithereens. These two elements form a fast-paced whole that rewards your reflexes and your smarts.        Playing Full Frontal Assault's competitive multiplayer either one-on-one or two-on-two, your goal is to destroy the six generators in your opponent's base while ensuring that at least one of your own generators survives. Play revolves through three phases--a node-capturing phase, a defense- and squad-purchasing phase, and an assault phase.     During the first phase, called recon, you zip across the map, enjoyably aided by rocket boosters on the soles of your boots. Nodes around the battlefield are guarded by meager defenses; by defeating those forces, you can claim the nodes as your own. Of course, during this time, your opponent is also racing to claim nodes, and may even try to take nodes that belong to you. Capturing nodes rewards you with weapons for your hero, and more importantly, each node you currently control pays out a steady stream of bolts over time.     Those bolts start coming in handy once the squad phase begins. During this phase, you can spend the bolts you've got coming in on base defenses--turrets, barriers, mines, and so on--and on forces that assault the enemy base. Do you pour all your bolts into trying to build a nigh-impregnable fortress? Do you go on the offensive, trying to overwhelm your opponent in the early stages? Or do you hedge your bets? During the first few rounds, your supply of bolts isn't great, but nodes gradually dish out more bolts as games progress, ensuring that battles escalate over time.        If your opponent secured more nodes than you during the previous recon phase, it's not easy to come back from a big bolt deficit, but it's not impossible, either. There's no rule that says you have to spend your entire squad phase in your base. You can't capture nodes during this time, but you can whittle away at the defenses on your opponent's nodes, making them quick and easy to take when the next recon phase begins and setting the stage for a possible comeback. While some battles are one-sided affairs that end in a quick and decisive victory, others have an exciting ebb and flow as players vie for dominance. There are enough tactical options available to you and your opponent to allow for a good deal of unpredictability and some sudden and surprising shifts in momentum.     The squad phase gives way to the assault phase, during which any squads you purchased assault the enemy base, and your base comes under attack from enemy forces. As before, you have a choice to make, and it can make a huge difference. Do you stick around and protect your generators, or put your considerable muscle into the assault on the enemy base? If your opponent's base is poorly guarded, your presence there can be the deciding factor in the battle. But if your defenses are inadequate to meet the enemy onslaught, your absence at home may be the final nail in your own coffin.     Solid shooting action supports the tactical decision-making. You start out with a straightforward combuster, but as you take nodes, you acquire an assortment of alternate weapons, as well as support items like the death-dealing robot sidekick Mr. Zurkon and the attack decoy known as Dopplebanger. Ammo is somewhat scarce on the battlefield, so the more weapons you're packing, the longer you can hold out in a fight. Smart use of your support items can help you take nodes and fend off enemy attacks, and in true Ratchet &amp; Clank tradition, weapons feel powerful and are fun to use. Unfortunately the AI of enemies you must sometimes use your weapons on isn't very sharp. You commonly find foes getting caught on the environment as they approach your base.     Ranked competitive matches rate your performance and then place you into one of several leagues. The system does a fine job of finding opponents at around your skill level, while also giving you the goal of getting better and climbing up the ranks. You can also host or join custom matches and play with friends.        In addition to the competitive multiplayer, there's a brief, rudimentary campaign that can be played either solo or in split-screen or online co-op. Most missions have you defending a base while venturing out onto the battlefield to take out enemy strongholds, and it all culminates in a decent boss battle. There are a few laughs to be had--seeing Captain Qwark flex heroically and pointlessly as he flies through the air is always amusing. But if you come to Full Frontal Assault hoping for a substantial single-player experience like those offered by so many Ratchet &amp; Clank games, you'll be disappointed.     This $20 game does one thing well: it has a competitive multiplayer mode that blends tactics and action in a way that allows for some exciting and unpredictable battles. You also get the Vita version with your purchase, though that won't be available until January. It's unfortunate that there aren't more multiplayer modes; as good as the one here is, you eventually wish for a change of pace from the cycle of recon, squad, and assault. But having your forces lay waste to your opponent's base as you keep his forces at bay with the dance-inducing power of a Groovitron is still a satisfying way to win a fight.  "
4027,Blade (2000),5.0,1,"Based on Wesley Snipes' filmic ""destroy all vampires"" romp from last year, Activision's Blade first appeared to be a more action-oriented take on horror-themed games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. In actuality, it's turned out to be more similar to beat- and shoot-'em-ups like Eidos' Fighting Force series and Sega's Zombie Revenge. Preliminary expectations aside, it's still a disappointment.   You play as the game's namesake, a human born with the powers of a vampire without the weaknesses or the need to drink blood. You and your partner Whistler have vowed to destroy the vampire menace, one at a time if necessary (and of course it is necessary). To aid you in doing so, you have an impressive arsenal with which to deal with the zombies, vampires, and possessed humans that oppose you. Besides your fists, you have a samurai sword, a handgun, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, and a machine gun. Some of these work better against certain enemies than others. For instance, the handgun is generally useless against the vampires, but your sword works very well when you're confronted with one. Likewise, the zombies are pretty impervious to your sword, but a few shots from your shotgun will dispatch them. While this juggling of weapons in the face of adversaries might sound like an interesting gameplay element, it's very frustrating when you enter a room that has, for example, two vampires and two gun-toting humans in it. Go to shoot the humans, and the vampires will block your shots. Go to attack the vampires with your sword, and the humans will shoot at you. Even under regular circumstances, having to constantly switch between weapons becomes tiresome quickly.   The same game engine that drove Shadow Master and Quake II for the PlayStation powers Blade, but it's now beginning to show its age. The engine worked well with first-person shooters, but third-person action games require more than it's willing to do. The game's platform jumping segments are played either from the standard behind-the-back view or from a fixed camera position. Neither works well, as it's hard to judge distance using the former and it's difficult to perceive the direction your character is facing using the latter.    In general, the game looks like an unsavory fusion of Probe's Die Hard Trilogy and Neversoft's Apocalypse. It's very dark, but not dark enough to hide its drab textures and frequent warping or the fact that its seams show from time to time. The environments seem to have been designed small to avoid instances of pop-up, but this shrinking also gives the game a claustrophobic feel that results in your character getting shot by enemies lurking around its many corners because you just don't have the space to get out of the way.   If it's possible that music, too, can fail to give you headroom, the concept is pioneered here. A good techno soundtrack can add a lot to an action game, so it's a shame that Blade doesn't have one. Instead, the game dishes out repetitive spin-cycle beats that never build with the action because they're already caught up in a state of perpetual fugue. The game's sound effects - which are made up of generic sound-library grade grunts, groans, and gunshots - are equally unimpressive.   Activision has enjoyed a pretty strong track record when it comes to translating comic books and movies into game form, but it's failed on both accounts here. Blade lacks the energy of the film, the feel of the comic, and the standards set by other games in its genre. Fans of third-person shooters are much better off looking up the original Syphon Filter or even one of n-Space's two Duke Nukem games."
3339,God of War: Ghost of Sparta,8.0,2,"      God of War: Chains of Olympus and punt dogs into specific objects as Kratos did in God of War III, but that doesn't hinder the fun of figuring out what needs to be done to proceed. The puzzles find a good middle ground between painfully obvious and maddeningly obtuse, so you still feel empowered when you solve a tricky conundrum and don't have to worry about being stranded in the same spot because it's way too challenging. The one flaw pertains, once again, to the zoomed-out camera and small screen. You often have to interact with a specific object to move on, and it can be tough to see what needs to be done when it's just a few pixels high. But, for the most part, the puzzles are a great respite from the hectic action.       Boss fights are the one area where Ghost of Sparta falters. You square off against a number of murderous monsters, and finishing them off in style is certainly exciting. But the fights are ultimately forgettable for a number of reasons. First, they are exceptionally easy. A seasoned God of War player should be able to breeze through every one of these encounters without any problems, and it's not exactly thrilling to topple a giant pushover. Second, they borrow so heavily from previous games in the series that they don't have an identity of their own. This is true for the vast majority of the game, whether it's the boss fights, puzzles, visual design, or combat, and it's not until the end that Sparta becomes its own beast. The entire last level, and especially the boss, is when Sparta finally separates itself from the games that came before it.      The biggest problem with Ghost of Sparta is that it tries so hard to mirror previous entries in the series that it doesn't have its own identity. This hinders the gameplay occasionally because a feeling of deja vu permeates all of your actions, and the PSP just can't match its console peers. But when Sparta's biggest problem is that it's too close to the excellent games that came before it, that's not a huge setback. This is not only an amazing-looking game, but it's incredibly fun as well. Slicing mischievous minions in a variety of stunning locales is an exhilarating experience, and because the adventure stretches on for more than 10 hours, you can lose yourself in this fantastical land for quite a while. Ghost of Sparta is a gorgeous and satisfying adventure that will keep you glued to the screen until the very end.  "
4345,Crime Stories: From the Files of Martin Mystere,4.0,0,"  Crime Stories is an appropriately generic title for a game as fundamentally uninteresting as the Adventure Company's latest crime solving adventure. Based within the universe of a popular Italian comic book called Martin Mystère, Crime Stories takes the titular comic book hero and thrusts him into a drab and uneventful murder mystery of snooze-worthy proportions. Its adherence to ancient adventure game mechanics doesn't help matters, but the fact that it can't even use these ancient mechanics well enough to qualify as a decent throwback to an olden genre is all the more damning. This game is a pixel hunt of the most redundant and boring kind, and nobody should waste their time with it.          Crime Stories' hero, Martin Mystère, is a professor of something. What, exactly, is never made entirely clear, but he's definitely of the scholarly ilk. Mystère lives with his wife in a New York City townhouse with a caveman butler (and that's not just a descriptor--he's literally a caveman) named Java. Various pieces of archeological and literary significance litter his house. As for the man himself, he evidently affords his life of luxury by solving mysteries. In Crime Stories, Mystère is called to the scene of a grisly murder at the home of a famous professor named Eulemberg. But before he can get there, he has to find the hidden key to his wardrobe, dig up the phone number for his auto mechanic, and find his cell phone. Yes, the entire first act of this game revolves around one of the great crime-solving minds of the world taking in upward of 45 minutes to get dressed, find a phone number, and dig up his cellular. Priceless.      All along the way, Mystère makes nonsensical quips as you click on every piece of clickable furniture in his house, forcing you to sit through endless strings of text about books, art pieces, and other meaningless bric-a-brac while you try to dig up the necessary items to head to the crime scene. To make matters worse, he does the exact same thing even once you've gotten into the actual crime itself. Upon arrival at Eulemberg's estate, Mystère begins quipping nonsense about every piece of everything he sees. The info is not even relevant most times. If you find a piece of evidence, he won't necessarily tell you why it's evidence or what the significance could be. He'll just talk, endlessly, about nothing. Suffice it to say, Mystère is not an enjoyable protagonist. He's just kind of a self-important windbag with a painfully bad sense of humor and no real personality to speak of. This isn't to say that any of the other characters you'll encounter throughout the adventure are much deeper, but you spend the entirety of the game with Mystère, and by the second or third act, you'll wish someone would just show up to kill him, already.      On top of Mystère's unlikable personality, the story has zero going for it. The first hour or so following the investigation of Eulemberg's body is a bit intriguing, but the evidence you find never seems to take you anywhere of consequence. Sure, there are some exotic locales and a few interesting twists and turns, but you spend entirely too much time putting together clues that aren't so much clues as they are extraneous ways to force you to backtrack over and over again. One sequence requires a ticket to get into a club to pick up an item so that you can get more info from someone you already talked to. To get the ticket, you have to go to a location to talk to a person, go through all the lines of dialogue, then go back to your house to find a book for them, bring it back, get the ticket, go to the club, find out the ticket doesn't work, go back to another location to use a device to make a forgery (that you'll only know exists if you're paying extra close attention), then go back to the club again to use the forged ticket, just to get this one item. And then the payoff for doing so isn't even satisfying or revelatory--you're just sent on even more annoying fetch quests.     It would be considered labyrinthine if the work itself weren't so by the numbers. Like any pixel hunting adventure game, Crime Stories has you eventually finding everything you're supposed to do by being thorough. If the mouse icon reveals a hot spot, click on it. Seventy-five percent of what you click on will be completely inconsequential, but you've got to do it, lest you miss that one obscure piece of evidence that gets you to the next chapter. That's nothing new for adventure games like this one, but none of the ancillary items you click on are interesting. There's no clever commentary about them, and they're not pleasant to look at. Everything's ugly and boring the whole way through.     The biggest and most egregious flaw in Crime Stories, however, is its presentation. The dialogue in particular is atrocious. In part it seems an abhorrent English translation is to blame (the game was originally released in Europe some time ago), but also the editing is simply terrible. When characters speak, if their sentence goes on longer than the dialog box at the bottom of the screen will allow, they will pause midsentence and then start the sentence back up a second later when the next part of the line loads up in the dialogue box. It's as if every character has been taking acting lessons from William Shatner, or something. There are also purposely inserted ""ums,"" ""ers,"" and other conversational stutters that are completely out of place, breaking up the flow of a conversation to the point where people are just speaking syllables and not even saying anything remotely coherent.           Crime Stories' graphics at least feature 3D character models, but the designs are awful. Mystère looks like a cross between Mickey Rourke as Marv in Sin City and Brian Setzer. Everybody moves in a stiff and jerky fashion, and most times moving a character into position to converse with another doesn't work right. There are sequences where Mystère will be standing with his back to someone he's talking directly to. Also, the characters look muddy. They're highly pixilated and are decidedly light on detail. Environments look similarly ugly. There are a few grandiose locations, but the scale is offset by the blurriness and pixilation of the static backgrounds. It's just not an attractive game by any stretch of the imagination.      You can finish Crime Stories in six or seven hours if you don't click on every single hotspot you see, but you'll be done with it long before the mystery reaches its conclusion. Trying to sit through Crime Stories' painful dialogue, patently uninteresting plot, and dinosaur-like gameplay is simply an exercise in self-punishment. Even with the adventure genre as hard up as it is these days, don't waste your time on a scattered mess like Crime Stories.    "
4334,Breed,4.0,0," Breed makes a horrible first impression. This single-player sci-fi shooter takes so outrageously long to load that it should ship with an alarm clock to wake you up when it's finally ready. Breed then makes many more bad impressions once you actually get to play it. You quickly see that it takes a lot of its ideas from the hit game Halo (and in turn from films like Starship Troopers and Aliens), and that it suffers from flimsy writing, atrocious voice acting, generic enemies and settings, frame rate hits, poor mission design, lagging multiplayer, and severe bugs. All isn't totally lost, though. For all that Breed does wrong, it at least lets you control some neat vehicles in expansive environments. Still, even in its good moments--which are uncommon--Breed is a poor game. During its many bad moments, you'll want to avoid it altogether.      Breed sends you to the twenty-seventh century, where a horde of alien creatures known as the Breed have lured most of Earth's military away to a distant colony to launch a sneak attack on Earth. You play as the few remaining GRUNT (Genetically Revived Universal Tactical Sentient) soldiers, basically clones, who return home to find Earth overrun with little purple and red aliens armed with glowing guns. You'd think a tale of a last-ditch effort to liberate Earth from alien hordes would be gripping. Not in Breed; it totally lacks emotional resonance. The scenarios, settings, and alien invaders feel generic, with no discernible character, let alone real style or imagination. The cutscenes are plodding and clumsy, and the writing leaves even more to be desired: ""A tear falls into my handkerchief,"" your silly and gabby leader solemnly intones. A character duly notes that her ""head hurts"" when she's blown up by artillery fire, and a soldier calls the Breed ""dumb heads"" as an insult. Some lines are oddly phrased: ""permission given"" instead of ""permission granted."" There are localization problems also, like a few words spelled in German in the subtitles.   Assuming you don't uninstall the game in frustration, you'll progress through eighteen missions, sometimes alone, but often with a small squad of GRUNTs. You play from either a first- or third-person view and assume direct control of any GRUNT in your squad at will. As in Halo, you'll zip around outdoors in futuristic dune buggies and tanks and fly in nimble fighters. You take over enemy turrets to blast hordes of hapless Breed, who often move, fight, and even do little sideways acrobatic dodges just like the aliens in Halo. Occasionally you'll fight indoors, too, but those settings are sparse and boring.   There's little fun to be had fighting on foot in Breed, in part because your squad mates are monstrously inept. They're far more of a hindrance than a help, since they barely return fire yet always manage to end up right in the line of fire--that is, when they're not falling off cliffs. (Things get even worse in some of the airborne missions, where your wingmen literally do nothing to help out.) Since the artificial intelligence allies in Breed always seem to be in need of rescuing, most of your ""tactics"" revolve around keeping them out of harm's way instead of using them as combat assets. It seems utterly superfluous that you can order them to spread out, close in, assume different formations, and so on. You'll mostly be ordering them to halt behind what little cover you can find or telling them to hand you a medikit when you're in dire straits.    GRUNTs are divided into a few different classes that determine what two weapons they initially carry (the two-weapon limit again recalling Halo). The weapons in Breed are all standard shooter fare: slightly futuristic assault rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and the like. Breed ignores one of the basic necessities of any shooter: The guns should look so cool and feel so powerful that the mere act of firing them is fun. Here, they're all pretty dull. As in Halo, you can pick up alien energy weapons, but these are also bland, not to mention inaccurate.   Breed takes a turn for the better with its vehicles. The ground vehicles, including tanks, buggies, jeeps, and APCs are easy to control (think Halo or Battlefield 1942) and boast physics that are just realistic enough without becoming cumbersome. Some of them bristle with multiple weapons, like the neatest GRUNT vehicle, the tank. You both steer it and aim the main turret, which lets you switch between a minigun, plasma cannon, guided missiles, and rockets. Meanwhile, other GRUNTs man smaller machine-gun turrets. It's overkill in the best sense. Cruising around and blasting towers and trees to dust can be fun while it lasts. (Fun never lasts long in Breed.) Air vehicles, like fighters and dropships, are a bear to control at first and can fall into irrecoverable stalls too easily, but once you get the hang of them you'll appreciate their high maneuverability.   Unfortunately, Breed's missions can be so numbingly repetitive, predictable, or downright confusing that it probably won't matter to you whether you're driving a snazzy vehicle or merely jogging about on foot. Superficially, the missions are well varied: You fight outdoors and in, on the ground and in the air (sometimes in the same mission). Sometimes there are timed segments to light a fire under you. Beneath that exterior diversity, you quickly see that the missions often follow the same basic patterns. Every time you turn a bend or crest a hill, out pops a horde of enemies, usually with a couple more firing nearby turrets or firing down from nearby hilltops. It's way too easy to guess exactly what will happen next.    Scripting problems, bugs, and confusing goals also mar missions. You're told a wingman is in trouble and that you need to help him, yet there are no enemies left that can hurt him. As you try to escort him to safety, he just mysteriously blows up for no reason, and there goes the mission.    On top of that, the aliens in Breed are about as smart as stones: Other than the occasional dodge, they mostly just charge you until they're all wiped out, or they stand around waiting to be sniped en masse. When they win, it's through sheer strength in numbers, and the game loves to overwhelm you with enemies. Airborne battles are similar in that they usually send one wave of fighters after another toward you with a clockwork precision.    Breed's presentation suffers from the same lack of imagination and polish that hurts the whole game. It's literally hard to remember what the aliens look like (other than their vague resemblance to Halo's enemies), and the same applies to the GRUNT armor, enemy bases, and most of the vehicles. The game's settings usually bear little resemblance to any real place on Earth, but rather feel like some generic fantasy planet. Technically, the graphics are reasonably impressive, rendering all kinds of flashy weapon fire and sprawling outdoor environments, but at the cost of stuttering frame rates--particularly during battles. Even with a high-end rig, you may have to crank the resolution or details down. The game is also annoying in that it requires you to re-specify your preferred refresh rate every time you play.       While the graphics have their good and bad points, the audio is often so bad you'll want to turn it off. Prepare yourself for audio stuttering and drop-outs, forgettable music, wimpy-sounding weapons and explosions, and horrid voice ""acting"" (by the game's developers instead of professional actors) replete with cheesy accents and mispronounced words (""stealth"" comes out as ""steelth"").   Along with the poor single-player campaign, Breed includes unimaginative multiplayer: just deathmatch variants. It can still be mildly fun to fly above the battlefield and bomb unsuspecting soldiers into oblivion, though we found multiplayer barely playable most of the time, even with the latest patch installed. Various bugs, some ill-conceived maps, and frequent--and often severe--lag, warping, and hit detection issues mean you can snipe someone in the head five times without it registering. Vehicles and characters often seem to teleport around the map, move through each other, or sink into the ground, even when you play over a broadband connection. Really, the only thing Breed has going for it is its wide variety of vehicles. But in a game with so many serious problems, it's hard to enjoy them for long. "
610,Destiny 2,8.0,2,"It's hard to overstate how much better Destiny 2 has become in the last year. The Forsaken expansion and the smaller, more frequent updates that followed added variety in activities that meant you could earn rewards while playing your favorite content, as well as a huge amount of new, weird lore to sift through, and secrets to uncover. It's not a stretch to say Destiny as a franchise was the best it's ever been in the second year of Destiny 2.The new Shadowkeep expansion builds on those foundations in just about every way. While returning to the moon is a pretty good time in and of itself--the expansion leans hard on the spooky locale, which was part of Destiny 1 but refreshed and enlarged for Destiny 2--it's the smaller improvements to the way the game works that are really the standout. Shadowkeep's content offerings aren't quite as sprawling, varied, or engaging as what we saw in Forsaken, but the expansion builds on the recent tweaks in Destiny 2 to make the moment-to-moment gameplay even stronger.Forsaken made some effort to establish Destiny 2 as a game that's constantly evolving. Instead of dropping a series of big content updates with little happening between them, Destiny 2's second year became a drip-feed of new stuff that helped keep the game compelling, for the most part, month after month. Bungie has said this approach is how it wants to handle the game going forward, and Shadowkeep represents a big step in that direction. That means parts of the expansion feels a bit truncated--it teases more to come, but leaves some of Shadowkeep a bit unsatisfying.Destiny 2 story campaigns have always been a touch lackluster--they usually pack cool individual missions, but they almost always end quickly and rarely amount to more than chasing down some big enemy and putting them in the ground. Shadowkeep's main story is also on the short side, wrapping up in a four or five dedicated hours (and less once you start leveling alternate characters who benefit from the high-level gear you've already procured). It's also clearly the first part of a much larger tale, one that Bungie says will play out over the entire year. As such, it presents something of an unsatisfying journey; it's the first few steps, rather than a complete arc, and you might be a bit surprised when it's suddenly over.Shadowkeep sees the return of a Destiny 1 character, Eris Morn, who was central to two previous expansions: The Dark Below and The Taken King. Here, Eris has learned that the death-worshipping faction, the Hive, has discovered something on the moon that's conjuring up phantoms of past foes and allies, returning deadly facsimiles of them to life. In a way, it's a big reunion tour of the Destiny of old. Eris is back, you return to the D1 location of the moon, which we haven't seen in two years, and you fight slightly watered-down versions of big bad guys you've previously defeated, such as Dark Below raid boss Crota and Destiny 2 vanilla boss Ghaul. It's something of an amped-up nostalgia trip that's a good time, especially if you've got a long history with the Destiny franchise--but we're waiting to reach the long-term endgame content that will wrap up some of these story threads.It is cool, however, to hang out on the moon, especially because its spooky factor has gone up. Lunar tunnels are filled with frightening screams of hidden terrors, there are plenty of tough enemies to dispatch, and the whole place carries an air of haunted mystery. It seems we've only scratched the surface of what's hidden on the moon so far. Destiny is at its best when it's full of secrets for the community to uncover, and the game has already provided a few big, baffling mysteries that have required everyone to band together to work out.Though it ends a little too quickly, the story campaign has some exciting moments as Guardians band together to attack and infiltrate the new Scarlet Keep location and discover what the Hive is up to. The rest of the expansion's new content is engaging as well. Nightmare Hunts are pretty much mini-Strikes, making them quick and palatable boss fights that help you grab new gear. A new take on Nightfall Strikes, the tougher versions of Destiny 2's three-player Strike activities, are enticing thanks to a ramping difficulty system that gives you challenges at a variety of Power levels. Exploring the moon has a lot to offer as well--though a lot of the location is made up of old areas, they're deep and maze-like, and every trip into their depths feels deliciously dangerous.There's also the Garden of Salvation raid, which became available a few days after launch, to give Destiny 2's highest-level players something to aspire to finishing. Destiny raids are often the best, most inventive content the game has to offer, and Garden of Salvation continues the tradition of including strange and fun mechanics that push your limits of skill and team coordination. It's one of the shorter raids with only four encounters, but includes big, exciting pieces, like a chase through a field exploding with enemy fire and a Gambit-like boss battle that requires teams to split into multiple groups to gather items and defend against team-wiping attacks. Garden of Salvation isn't quite the equal of the massive Forsaken raid, Last Wish, but it's a highlight of Shadowkeep for certain.Vex Offensive, a new six-player wave-based activity that dropped alongside the raid, helps to round out the amount of stuff Shadowkeep gives you to do for its first season. Like last season's Menagerie, it has the feeling of being a lighter, easier raid-like activity that's more accessible for those who aren't quite hardcore enough to take on Garden of Salvation. The activity itself requires a little more teamwork than the usual Destiny 2 event, without being impossible to do if you're matchmaking alone. It's a fun change of pace from Strikes or Crucible, and its huge dump of rewards mean chasing the best rolls for its many guns doesn't feel like a chore.Where Shadowkeep really excels, however, is less in the content to work through and more in the myriad smaller changes Bungie has made to totally revamp Destiny 2. The biggest changes focus on making character builds a more important part of the experience, giving you a chance to experiment with weapons and armor not just to make your character more powerful in general, but more powerful in ways that specifically meet your particular play style and needs.Driving that focus is the new approach to weapon and armor mods, which allows you to mix and match elements that were previously unmovable perks on particular pieces of gear. In the past, you had to spend so much time switching gear in order to make your overall stats go up that more nuanced numbers, like how fast your grenades recharged or how quickly you moved, could generally be ignored. Making sure you had the best rolls on particular gear only really mattered in the game's toughest activities and to the most hardcore members of the community.With Armor 2.0 and the new weapon mod system, you can move those perks (now as individual mods) between armor sets to build a few pieces of gear with exactly the capabilities you want. You're also no longer penalized for experimenting since mods aren't consumed on use. It means that once you start to get some pieces of armor and weapons that work really well for you, it's possible to continually tweak them to fit how you want to play the game and your particular role on a team.Shadowkeep's tweaks to higher-level enemy encounters, like adding enemies that require specific mods to defeat, provide excellent opportunities to experiment with character builds and loadouts. Especially in Garden of Salvation, I found myself stopping to try different equipment combinations to help me deal with tough enemies or specific situations. The system provides a lot of opportunities to think about and develop character builds; more than I've been doing through most of the five years I've played Destiny. It's an improvement that makes the game's core loop of constantly chasing new gear feel like it matters to how you play the game--and it's one Destiny desperately needed.The early leveling system has been improved significantly as well, making the climb to the endgame a lot more reasonable. Leveling up your character is (mostly) gone in favor of constantly chasing gear with better Power numbers. Up to the soft Power level cap, every drop is a useful one--giving you a chance to try out a host of different weapons and armor in various circumstances before you get to Shadowkeep's toughest content. Shadowkeep's change to move experience points from a needless character-leveling system to a battle pass and new Seasonal Artifact item also helps a major ongoing Destiny problem of running out of things to do as you approach maximum level. Everything earns you experience to advance your battle pass and artifact, and the latter of which contributes to your characters' overall Power level, so there's a lot less wasted time chasing useless rewards.Much of the experience of live service games like Destiny 2 is in the continued chase after better gear and more power in the endgame. While things slow down significantly during the post-soft cap climb, progress feels steady through the game's decent variety of activities, especially with the addition of Vex Offensive. Bungie's changes to the system strike a nice balance between the issues of Year Two, when so many activities started to feel like chores, and the problems of the past, when progressing was a much slower grind. Pushing hard through a week's worth of Powerful gear drops can get you raid-ready in a hurry, but with a number of new guns to chase and new activities to master, there's still a lot for top-tier players to focus on beyond trying to raise their Power level through the roof. The new Seasonal Artifact also helps balance the grind by continually awarding additional Power points regardless of the numbers on your gear. As a result, you never feel stalled, no matter what part of the game you're playing.Shadowkeep represents a shift in the fundamentals of Destiny 2, and that has only improved the game. Returning to the moon is full of spooky fun, and while Shadowkeep might not be as huge as Forsaken, it still provides some impressive additions to the world that will take time to fully explore. More meaningful choices in Shadowkeep are pushing me to think beyond just packing my most powerful guns and shooting everything in my path. These are improvements that represent a giant leap forward for Destiny 2."
3089,MX vs. ATV Alive,6.0,1,"MX vs. ATV Reflex, though; there's no structured career mode, there are no vehicle types beyond those mentioned in the title, and there are only two event types: Race and Free Ride. Additional features are promised in the form of downloadable content, but right now, this off-road offering barely does enough to justify even its seemingly attractive $40 price tag.        Climbing onto either a 125cc motocross bike or a 250cc quad in MX vs. ATV Alive as a level 1 rider can be daunting, particularly if you never played Reflex. Not only do you have to use both analog sticks to control your vehicle and rider independently of each other, but the game also makes no attempt to explain more advanced techniques: using the clutch to get off the start line quickly or to maintain speed through corners, or locking your seat bounce to preload for a jump, for example. Regardless, it shouldn't take you long to get a handle on the basics and start winning races.     There are four different difficulty settings to choose from, so you should have no problem finding appropriately challenging AI opposition. As you recklessly throw yourself into corners launch off of huge mounds of dirt, you have to contend with opponents who, while capable of making mistakes, are always fiercely competitive. Collisions are commonplace, but where in previous games these would often end badly, here they can work to your advantage because it's not uncommon to send an opponent to the dirt without taking a tumble yourself. Major mishaps aside, anytime you're in danger of falling off your ride, you're afforded an opportunity to recover by quickly flicking the right analog stick in the direction indicated onscreen to maintain your balance. It's the same system that was used in Reflex, and it works well; races are far less frustrating when you're not falling off after every mistake and you're not punished for riding aggressively.     At the end of every race, both you and your currently selected vehicle earn experience points and levels. Leveling up unlocks all manner of extra customization options. These include new paint jobs, performance-improving parts for your vehicles, and licensed rider gear. There are also rider abilities that, once equipped in the two available slots, can make it easier to prevent spills, knock opponents out of the way, or recover from falls, for example. There's even an ability that increases the number of experience points you receive after every race as well, which is very useful when you're eager to unlock the tracks that don't become available until you reach levels 10 and 25. (Alternatively, you can spend around $6 to unlock everything instantly.)        On the disc, MX vs. ATV Alive offers a dozen different full-length tracks, plus four short tracks and a couple of modest free-ride environments. Annoyingly, the vast majority of this mostly good content isn't available from the outset, and unlocking it takes long enough that you inevitably end up having to replay the same handful of tracks over and over again while leveling up. A redeemable code included with new copies of the game can be used to download two additional tracks located in a third free-ride environment, but even taking those into account, the selection that's on offer for the first few hours of racing is woefully inadequate.      One way to lessen the repetition of racing against the same AI riders on the same tracks is to put your skills to the test against human opponents, which still earns you experience points for your persistent rider and vehicles. MX vs. ATV Alive supports two-player split-screen in a full field of 12 racers, as well as online play for up to 12 riders. Split-screen play works well enough, though there's some noticeable texture and object pop-in that's not present when playing solo. The mostly lag-free online play suffers no such distractions and is a lot of fun, especially if get into a racing session with similarly skilled opposition. After selecting which class you want to race in (there are three bike and two quad classes to choose from), you're placed into a lobby with other players, and between races, you get to vote on which track is raced next.   lot of air for them to be successful.        Whether performing tricks or waiting at the start gate, riders and vehicles are reasonably detailed, and though track surfaces occasionally appear pixilated, the environments also look good when you're racing through them at speed. The most impressive aspect of the visuals, which also has an impact on gameplay, is that tracks get increasingly deformed and believably torn up by the bikes and ATVs as races progress, sprinkling every lap with a little welcome unpredictability. MX vs. ATV Alive is a better racing game than its predecessor, but sadly, it's not nearly as good a value proposition. Even after you spend several hours unlocking all that it has to offer, this is a game that's sorely in need of more content. It's coming, but rather than adding to an already fully featured game, here, it's hard not to feel like DLC will merely bring it closer to being the game it should've been from day one.  "
3419,NHL Slapshot,8.0,2,"                  Although you might be tempted to dismiss NHL Slapshot as a lesser, kiddie knockoff of NHL 11 geared for the Wii's younger demographic, don't be too quick to rate it as an also-ran. This is a great arcade hockey game with unique controls that is an absolute blast to play with a friend (who should bring his own stick since only one is included with the game) or when you just want to experience something completely different from traditional gamepad hockey.   "
4061,John Romero's Daikatana,5.0,1,"After more than three years in production, Daikatana, the first game developed entirely in-house by Ion Storm, has been released. And it's pretty bad. Ironically, Daikatana's biggest failures are due in large part to both a lack of imagination and poor design choices - in short, the very principles on which Ion Storm was founded.   Daikatana is a cross between a first-person shooter and a stat-based, story-driven role-playing game. But you get the feeling the game isn't going to tread any new narrative ground early on. Daikatana's opening scene is five minutes of dense, tedious exposition delivered as a virtual monologue by a character who stands still while the camera makes swooping motions around him. At some point in his speech he apparently gets killed but then recovers just enough to deliver another minute of exposition in the classic dying-guy choked gasp. In a sense, the segment does set a mood: Since you realize that Daikatana is supposed to be story-driven, you'll find that the numbing lack of creativity displayed in both the structure and writing of this first scene acts as an ill omen of things to come.   The plot is advanced through periodic in-game cutscenes that are usually shorter than the opening cutscene but equally inane. It's as if whoever wrote the story wasn't aware of the game going on between the plot points. At one point your character Hiro is spooked by the appearance of a ghost after having just dispatched two hundred reanimated skeletons in the previous level. At a later point, characters debate walking through a graveyard. One of them says he has a bad feeling about it, while another chides him for being superstitious. Meanwhile, they've both forgotten that they were battling an entire army of zombies moments ago and that the time for healthy skepticism is over. This sort of disparity between the plot and the gameplay is frequent and gives the story a cheap, threadbare quality that works against any atmosphere the game attempts to build.   The role-playing elements are a wash as well. Hiro has attributes for speed, rate of fire, vitality, power, and jump height. You gain experience by killing monsters, and when enough points are accrued, you can raise one of the attributes a notch, up to a maximum of five per attribute. The problem is that the level raising has little noticeable effect on gameplay. In fact, the entire system could simply be removed from the game, and the experience of playing Daikatana would be virtually unchanged. The Daikatana itself can gain up to five levels if you use the weapon to kill enemies. By the fifth level, it's arguably the most powerful weapon in the game, but it's distracting to carry around because it bisects the screen and has animated blue energy lines flickering around it. It's probably the biggest weapon in shooter history. The sword has a little more effect on the game than Hiro's stats, but it's still ultimately a gimmick that seems more like an afterthought than a tightly integrated feature.   Even with its nonsensical story and irrelevant RPG trappings, Daikatana could still have emerged as a good shooter if the action parts had turned out well. Unfortunately, the action portions of Daikatana frustrate more often than they entertain due to a combination of inconsistent level design, a poorly realized sidekick feature, and an unforgiving save system.   The sidekicks are by far the biggest problem and effectively ruin the experience of playing Daikatana. For much of the game, you're accompanied by up to two computer-controlled companions. They fight alongside of you, give you bits of information, and arbitrarily do things like scream ""wazzzzzup?!"" more times than they probably should. If either of the sidekicks gets killed, the game is over. Unfortunately, they have a tendency to get lost, shoot you, walk into your line of fire, get crushed under doors, fall to their deaths, get stuck running toward walls, and generally cause you grief. The sidekicks are a burden, and managing them is a chore. Yet unlike the story and statistics, they are a nontrivial part of the game that cannot be ignored. You can give them the same basic commands you would a dog, such as come, stay, back off, and fetch, but they won't always listen to you. It's especially frustrating when your buddies refuse to grab much-needed health packs sitting atop even the gentlest incline.  Daikatana's save system complements the sidekick problem. Eschewing the save-anywhere feature used by virtually every modern shooter, the designers have implemented a system whereby you must find ""save gems"" in order to save your progress. You can carry as many as three gems at once, which can then be traded at any time for an opportunity to save your game. Progress is also saved at level transitions. In theory, it's not a bad system. It builds tension by creating an actual penalty for death. If death in Daikatana were only caused by your own lack of skill, there would be no problem with the save-gem concept. However, since death is often the result of a failure of the game logic controlling your sidekicks, a save system that could have built tension instead creates acute frustration. In addition, the placement of the gems is inconsistent. Since you have no idea what lies ahead of you or how long each level is, it would have been nice if the designers had placed the gems in such a way that you could infer some meaning from their position. Sometimes the gems are located in a perfect spot for saving, and sometimes they're placed five feet from a level transition. A few of the boss battles that occur in the middle of a level also could have used a gem right afterward.   The game takes place across four time periods: far-future Japan, ancient Greece, Dark Ages-era Norway, and San Francisco in the year 2030. The first of these, future Japan, features the straightforward action of the original Doom. The monsters in this episode set the tone for the rest of the game. Although the appearance of the monsters changes throughout the course of the game, they all exhibit the same simple artificial intelligence. Virtually every enemy runs straight toward you until you either kill it or it gets stuck on something, which happens a lot. The look of this first set of levels is uninspired. The world starts out monochromatic green and eventually becomes monochromatic blue. You must navigate a very long series of similar-looking twisty corridors to reach your final destination.   The second world, Ancient Greece, looks better than the Japan levels but actually represents the low point of Daikatana's level design. It starts off with wide-open spaces and bright colors that offer a respite from the dark cramped feeling of the previous episode. The open areas even allow for some pitched battles against hordes of oncoming skeletons. But it soon degenerates into a stuffy corridor crawl, this time in brown.   By being strictly linear, the first episode sets a precedent that the second episode proceeds to break, which can be confusing. In the first episode, level transitions are absolute. There's no need to backtrack. The second episode requires you to backtrack a lot. It's confusing because your goals are not clearly presented, and the play mechanic of the second episode directly contradicts the rules of the game universe you've learned by playing the first episode. At one point, instead of informing you up front that your goal is to collect a series of keystones, the game waits until you actually need them to give you that important fact. The sinking sensation that occurs when you realize you're going to have to go back and reexplore the giant level is profound.   Near the beginning of the third episode, one of your pals becomes sick, and the healthy one must carry the other through the entire world, making both of them essentially useless for fighting. You must simply protect them. These levels really put the babysitting skills you've learned up to this point to the test, and they lead to more frustration. The fourth episode is a return to modern times and features a recurring find-the-hidden-key theme.   The designers did make one commendable decision. They have included a cooperative multiplayer feature. Up to three people, one playing Hiro and two people controlling the sidekick characters, can play through a modified version of the single-player game. The experience is modified in the sense that both the story and the computer-controlled sidekicks are removed. The game benefits greatly from their absence, and in this mode the game is often more fun and less maddening.   Several other standard multiplayer modes are included, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and deathtag, a variation on capture the flag in which two players must work together to retrieve the goal object. In a few online tests, it seemed as if the weapon balancing was off, as everyone would scramble for the superweapon available in each time period.   There are moments playing Daikatana in which everything comes together - the sidekicks act as they should or simply aren't around, and you're able to enjoy the game as a pure, unadulterated shooter. But these moments are rare and are separated by long stretches of frustration punctuated by tedium. It's true that the game has a lot of content. The levels are large, there are plenty of monsters and weapons, and it will take you some time to finish. Yet a shorter, less disjointed experience with a few memorable set pieces would have been preferable. After years of development and a vast body of negative press, Daikatana is not an unmitigated disaster. But unfortunately, that's not enough to endorse it. "
4221,Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Subway,4.0,0,"  After delivering a poor game with Spider-Man 2 3D: New York Rooftops, Sony decided to release a follow-up to capitalize on that nonexistent momentum. Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Subway is like its predecessor in every way, only it takes place on an outdoor railroad. Even if you're a passionate fan of the film or comic, you still won't enjoy this joyless hodgepodge of minigames. Purchasing the LG VX 8000 version of NY Subway for $10 is a horrible value, especially since it's such a poor game.        NY Subway consists of five minigames, each of which must be beaten three times to advance to the next. These are loosely based on the scene in the Spider-Man 2 film in which Spidey must chase Doc Ock on a moving train. At no point do NY Subway's rhythm-based games make you feel like Spider-Man. The only combat sequence consists of the pressing of random buttons in time with their onscreen representations.     It's as yet unknown whether the joy of webslinging could be conveyed through a mobile phone's keypad. Spider-Man 2: NY Subway's simple timing games can't represent the medium's pinnacle, however. Pressing the up and down keys alternately to dodge thrown beams feels like a chore. Testing a player's reflexes is one thing, but Spidey's got more powers than just a spider sense.      Graphically, this game looks a bit better than its predecessor. The 3D models have undergone some work, and they more closely resemble the characters they are meant to represent. These models are set, though, in supremely unimpressive environments without much detail. For example: you're on a moving train, but you could be anywhere in the world, because there's no background at all--just a bright, white overlay, indicating outdoor ambient light. The sound isn't particularly worth enabling, and it certainly isn't what you'd hope for from the purportedly multimedia-rich V Cast service.     Playing Spider-Man 2: New York Subway is a poor use of your time. Its gameplay is identical to that of its predecessor, and it isn't any more compelling a second time around. The graphics are supposed to be the main draw here, but they're not nearly impressive enough to warrant V Cast's $10 price tag. NY Subway can be completed in about half an hour, and there's no reason you'd want to play for longer, save to justify your unwise purchase.    "
3342,Red Dead Redemption,8.0,2,"Red Dead Redemption's world, nobody has a clue what's going on or how to deal with it. Reprising the role of protagonist John Marston, you become embroiled in the battle against the undead when the brain munching hits a little too close to home. And as Undead Nightmare's story unfolds, it becomes clear that similar events are playing out across the entire map from the original game. This horror-themed and often humorous add-on isn't the tour de force that Red Dead Redemption was, but it's great fun and a welcome excuse to return to memorable locations like Blackwater, Armadillo, and Chuparosa.        With that said, Red Dead Redemption's world feels very different in Undead Nightmare. A large percentage of the population is either dead or undead, the wildlife is different, and every town on the map has been overrun by victims of what the survivors believe to be some new kind of plague--caused possibly by immigrants, the government, or both. You need to liberate towns before you can accept missions or even sleep and save your progress in them, and although you can't head south of the border initially, you're free to tackle towns that you can reach at any time and in any order. Reclaiming towns for the living also affords you the ability to fast-travel between them, which you are likely to take advantage of on occasion, even if you enjoy lengthy rides through the wilderness.     When you enter a settlement that's under siege, your goal is to completely eradicate the undead presence. Survivors do a good job of assisting you if you share some of your ammo with them, but you should know that--at least early on--bullets are something of a commodity in Undead Nightmare because none of the stores that sell them are open for business. Regardless of what you choose to do with your precious projectiles, the clearing of every town unfortunately plays out in much the same way. You arrive in town, decide whether or not you're going to give bullets to the locals, and then do your best to kill rather than satisfy your enemies' hunger for brain meat. The problem is that while decapitations of the decaying are entertaining for a time, combat in Undead Nightmare isn't as much fun as it was in Red Dead Redemption. There are some sweet new weapons to play with, including a powerful blunderbuss that uses zombie parts for ammunition, but you're unlikely to ever need them.     Undead enemies don't pose as much of a challenge as their cowboy counterparts. The living-impaired don't use guns, don't use cover, and don't ride horses. For the most part, they just head straight for you, and they're only dangerous when they attack in numbers. Some sorely needed challenge and variety comes courtesy of three special zombie types, but even these faster, stronger, and retching reanimated are no match for the tactics that you're likely to employ once you get a feel for how your encounters with them play out. The easiest way to kill a zombie is with a headshot, and the easiest way to get a headshot is to forgo aiming from a distance and just squeeze the trigger after moving into melee range. It doesn't matter which zombie you're up against or which gun from Undead Nightmare's sizeable arsenal you have equipped because the result is the same. Alternatively, you can kill zombies with fire, putting the new torch weapon to good use. Waving the torch around and watching your enemies burn as they continue to pursue you is initially a lot of fun, but even this gets old after an hour or so. You're free to engage in traditional gunplay if you choose, of course, but it's unfortunate that Undead Nightmare never encourages you to do so, and it's disappointing that anytime you take position on a rooftop, you get to pick off the undead with ease because, like fish in a barrel, they can't climb ladders.        Thankfully, a number of the story missions require you to do things other than just kill the undead, and there are also plenty of optional challenges to undertake. There are missing persons to locate and return to their loved ones in missions that play out a lot like the original game's bounties. There are also new skill challenges and outfits to complete, as well as mythological creatures to track down and tame. Specifically, it's possible to break the four horses of the apocalypse; Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death. All four of these nags look great, and each offers a different gameplay advantage. War sets nearby enemies on fire while Pestilence is resistant enough to pain that even attacks from undead cougars are no cause for concern, for example. Famine's perk is unlimited stamina, but given that their stamina gauges never move, the other three mythological mounts appear to have that as well.      Depending on how much of the optional content you choose to complete and how much you use the fast-travel option, Undead Nightmare's story might take you anywhere from five to a dozen or more hours to complete. The add-on ends every bit as well as Red Dead Redemption did, and if you haven't beaten the original game yet, you'd do well to do so before playing this add-on. That way, you can fully appreciate not only the superb ending but also the appearance of numerous returning characters whose predicaments are made even more amusing by your knowledge of them from previous encounters. Seth the grave robber, for example, is still messing with the deceased and now attempting to befriend them.     In addition to its sizable single-player offering, Undead Nightmare introduces a new multiplayer mode titled Undead Overrun. Up to four of you team up and then, after deciding on which of the four weapon loadouts you each want to play with, you're dropped into a spooky environment and must survive for as long as possible against increasingly tough waves of undead. In a neat twist on the formula, the in-game clock counts down rather than up and can be replenished only by opening coffins that appear on the map between waves. This not only forces you to move around rather than fortify yourself inside a structure, but also encourages you to take risks so that you can clear the waves as quickly as possible. Cooperation is a must, and if you stray too far from your teammates, they're less likely to come and revive you successfully should you find yourself incapacitated.        While it clearly retains many of Red Dead Redemption's best qualities as far as presentation is concerned, Undead Nightmare isn't a more-of-the-same add-on. The combat isn't as good, the story isn't as compelling, and the missions aren't as varied. On the flipside, the humor is more plentiful, the arsenal is more imaginative, the soundtrack is suitably spooky, and the rare mounts are now well worth the fairly minimal effort that it takes to track them down. There's a whole lot of fun to be had here for just 800 Microsoft points, which makes Undead Nightmare a great reason to return to the world of Red Dead Redemption.  "
1768,The Crew,5.0,1," You start off in the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a trope-filled campaign that plays out like a Fast &amp; Furious sequel, send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover, The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking. It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally outdated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of aliasing.   At some point during your journey across America, you wonder: what was that about forming a crew, again? Despite the game's title and pitch, The Crew is a single-player experience tucked into a multiplayer server. It starts with a story that casts you on a grand mission, and you're constantly encouraged by your cohorts to head to the next step along the way. You always have the option of inviting three of your friends along for the ride, but at no point does the game inspire you to do so. Think extra crewmates will help you on a difficult mission? Nope; the game scales its difficulty accordingly. If anything, forming a crew is a chore that's easy to brush aside. The best thing you can do to improve your chances at success is to upgrade your car, but the way in which The Crew facilitates this can get a little frustrating. While the game won't prevent you from entering a story mission, it will tell you if you're below the recommended level. You can purchase kits when you're avatar's level is high enough, but it takes a while to hit successive milestones. In practice, you earn new parts as rewards for missions, but playing story missions alone won't provide you with enough parts to get your vehicle to the appropriate level towards the end of the game. That's when you have to grind through optional missions, which pop up as you drive around the map. Some of these objectives are enjoyable, such as long-distance jumps and missions that challenge you to drive as fast and as far as you can while keeping your tires on the road. Others, like the missions that challenge you to hit a series of targets that are strewn both on and off the road, are frustrating. Essentially, the game asks you to drive like a jerk, and it's not fun when you can't help but careen into other cars and buildings as you try your best to fulfill the criteria to earn a medal. It comes down to the luck of the draw. Sometimes the coast is clear, and other times you're bombarded by a phalanx of other vehicles that you can't avoid when pursuing objectives. These optional missions can be useful when you need to level up, but they can also be an annoyance when you're just trying to get from point A to point B. Every time you hit the road, you eventually cross the virtual gate that activates these missions, but there's nothing you can do to prevent them from activating automatically. Pass through a gate, and you have to suffer through a cluttered user interface, which starts with icons, but ends with a large results screen that blocks your view while driving. Apart from driving off the road to avoid a gate, or entering into a menu to abort after a mission activates, you're at the mercy of the map. One of the best aspects of a racing game is the selection of cars that you get to choose from, but The Crew has a meager selection and does a poor job of incentivizing you to explore your options. Story missions are broken up by the type of vehicle they require: street, dirt, raid, performance, or circuit. Not every vehicle can be kitted out to fit every spec, but the one you get at the start of the game definitely can. Given that you earn new parts for the vehicle you complete missions with, you are never compelled to pick up new cars. Maybe your curiosity will get the better of you and you'll check out a new car, but there's nothing stopping you from using the same car from the beginning of the game through to the end. Although the variety of cars is underwhelming and underutilized, the story missions take advantage of the different car specs in a good way. As you travel from one region of the country to the next, you encounter different terrain and environments that call upon the different types of kits you can fit to your car. You race street cars through dense cities, take on dirt car races through construction sites and rough terrain, and tear across states in souped up performance vehicles. The story missions are largely the best moments in the game, however, there exceptions: raid car missions and fleeing missions. Raid missions are fun at first--you charge through mountains, swamps, and back country in an armored vehicle--but at some point, the game decides that you need to fulfill precise criteria, such as collecting objects on rough terrain under a strict time limit, and raid cars are anything but precise. They slip and slide all over the place, and when these missions leave no room for error, you end up very frustrated when you're cut short due to the game's poor physics. The same can be said for missions where you have to flee from cops, who are incredibly overpowered. These missions are not fun in the least, and the cops' unusual bursts of speed feels like a product of driving games of old. This isn't the only example of frustrating AI. During races against the computer, cars sometimes drive off of tracks for no reason, taking a 90 degree turn out of the blue before flying off of a cliff. Essentially, the game asks you to drive like a jerk, and it's not fun when you can't help but careen into other cars and buildings as you try your best to fulfill the criteria to earn a medal. With rough physics and AI, you get into a lot of collisions, but luckily, damage doesn't hinder your car's driving capabilities. However, you do have to endure a slow-motion cutscene as punishment when you take a strong hit. Eventually, you have to pay a negligible fee to fix your car if you've gotten in a lot of accidents, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to how much money you earn during missions. If crashing is not a big deal, wasting players' time with slow-motion cutscenes as punishment is pointless and disrespectful of their time. Unfortunately, you have to endure the game's questionable physics in other scenarios, most notably during player-versus-player races. It's nearly a guarantee that each PVP race will start with a ridiculous display of bugginess when opponents' cars suddenly speed up and flip in multiple directions at the drop of a hat. I've seen cars teleport into the sky, and rotate uncontrollably before appearing 20 feet down the track for no reason. These moments of chaos are funny, but they make for an inconsistent and unpredictable experience. Pray it doesn't happen to you. That's assuming you can even get into a PVP match. There are a handful of lobbies across the map, but they're severely underpopulated. It's a rare occurrence that you can find enough people to race against in less than 15 minutes. Luckily, you have the option to drive around while you wait, but it's still deflating when you can't find anyone to play with.   Keep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have issues. When The Crew puts you into races with good AI, and you get to race through interesting and varied environments, you get the feeling that you're playing a good game. When you struggle to find people to join your crew online, balk at the outdated graphics, and shake your head at the AI and the occasionally unpredictable physics, you realize: The Crew isn't that good after all. When you can't play due to server issues, you find a new game to play and leave The Crew in your dust."
3133,Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes,8.0,2,"     Despite the similar name, Clash of Heroes isn't quite a Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game. You might be confused in the beginning, however, because the basic structure here is nearly identical to those predecessors. The main mode of play is a campaign where you lead five young heroes in the fantasy land of Ashan (featured in Heroes of Might and Magic V on the PC) into battle while trying to soothe tensions that sneaky demons have stirred up between the realm's leading kingdoms. You start off with a hero who gains experience, casts spells, and equips artifacts. And, you lead units of D&amp;D refugees into battle against foes in one-on-one arena-styled duels. Quick Battle mode and multiplayer are both available online and off, letting you stage one-versus-one or two-versus-two battles with customized armies (new to Clash of Heroes for consoles). Cosmetically, the game looks and feels different from previous releases in the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series, with the art tipped toward cheerful, colorful anime, and the mostly lighthearted plot aimed at an all-ages crowd.    Puzzle Quest-derived match-three format with rows of troops aligned into grids. You have a limited number of moves to make for each turn and can only shift the last unit in a line or remove a unit farther up in a column. Generally, you try to set up an attack or a defense with each move. Attacks are arranged by lining up same-colored units vertically aimed toward the enemy formation. If you place three green elven hunters in a row, for example, they chain, which means that they activate and start charging for an attack in a subsequent turn. When troops do attack, they generally charge straight into the enemy columns, doing damage to any foes or fortifications along the way. The goal is to get to the back of the enemy line, where you inflict damage to your opponent's health. Bonus damage is earned by linking multiple attacks of the same color at the same time, as well as by fusing two attack groups stacked on top of one another. Defenses are arranged in the same way, although here, you line up same-colored units horizontally. This creates walls that block enemy assaults and are invaluable for keeping powerhouse foes away from your back line.     Grim Fandango, demons, wizards, and pretty much the rest of the monster manual refugees that populate traditional Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games.      In addition to the basic concepts described above for low-end grunts, you field elite and champion units that activate when you stack two or four same-color units directly behind them. Successfully setting up one of these units requires some finagling because they take up a lot of territory on the battle grid, but pulling off an attack with one tends to be absolutely devastating on the enemy. You can launch root attacks with treants, for instance, or send green dragons flying over enemy walls and lay waste to everything beyond with acid breath. Heroes also have special spells that charge when you do damage during battles. Magic arrows, lightning bolts, and fireballs are just three of the incantations that can be deployed at key moments to take down enemy defenses or obliterate health points. Heroes can also equip artifacts that provide the usual attack and defense buffs, along with special frills like regenerating walls and boosting experience points.       Despite all of these layers it's not difficult to get a handle on the basics, but to succeed beyond the first few fights you need to be quick study. Soon enough you'll be pulling off tricky fusion and chain attacks with relative ease. The game isn't exactly easy on you, though, especially in the beginning. After the first few simple battles, the difficulty shoots up dramatically, putting you into positions where you have to consistently make smart, efficient moves or see the enemies mop the floor with you. These encounters are made more challenging by the presence of high-powered enemy elite and champion units. If you let just one of them get off an attack in these battles, you generally lose instantly because of their high attack damages and your low early health points. This can be a tough lesson to learn early on because these devastating attacks that generate an astonishing 40 to 50 hit points of damage come as a huge surprise, given how grunt troops do no more than 10 at a shot and usually much fewer. Even though there are some battles that you simply can't win without a bit of trial and error, you can still always see the light at the end of the tunnel. You feel like you're learning the game while you're having your head handed to you, so instead of being frustrated, you keep going with the story and getting better with every fight. The campaign also features side quest puzzle battles where you need to win in just a single turn, which are great exercises that teach you how to get the absolute most out of the limited number of moves available.     Porting the game from the small screens of the Nintendo DS to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 has not been accomplished without some problems. There is a noticeable issue here with scale. While the graphics are big, sharp, and colorful during the talking-head cutscenes, movement and battle screens appear scrunched. Text is very small. Lines aren't quite too small to read, but the font size is definitely a lot tinier than it should be for a game that is supposed to be played on the couch at a reasonable distance from your TV. Battle graphics are also somewhat indistinct. Units seem tiny; their features are smashed together to the point that you can't really make out fine details. This generally doesn't affect gameplay because you can usually tell units apart. Still, some unit colors are shown only as highlights that can be hard to see, so it is possible to mess up and mistake, say, a green deer for a blue one. Battle screens are the least-attractive part of the game, which is really unfortunate because that is where you spend the majority of your time. Another, more minor issue is the new multiplayer mode of play. While it is diverting to duel online with other human players, there isn't enough to the one-off battles featured to keep you coming back for long. Something like a full-blown tournament mode might have livened things up a lot.       Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes is one of those ""just one more turn"" games that is nearly impossible to stop playing. Battles are tough and sometimes unfair given the surprises that await you as you fight your way across the land of Ashan, but the puzzles are still fiendishly addictive. The game's roots on the tiny screen of the Nintendo DS are apparent in the often Lilliputian graphics and text, but when you're caught up in this irresistible adventure, these flaws hardly matter.   "
4320,Street Hoops,4.0,0,"Street Hoops is an attempt by Activision and developer Black Ops Entertainment to make a fast-paced basketball game with a whole lot of hip-hop flavor. Or, to put it another way, Street Hoops is an attempt to duplicate the success of EA's similarly themed NBA Street while delivering a more authentic street ball experience. However, unlike EA's game, Street Hoops is shallow and incredibly dull.  There are a handful of different modes to choose from, beginning with the standard five-on-five full-court action. You can also play down to three-on-three full court or anywhere from three-on-three to one-on-one in half-court modes. The world championship mode is the main mode here, letting you pick a team and travel to the game's different locales to play the other teams in the league, earning money along the way. That money can be used to change the appearance of your players. There's an apparel store that lets you choose from a large collection of clothing lines, including Ecko, Pure Playaz, Rocawear, and many, many more. The pawnshop is used as a jewelry store, and here you can buy fat rope chains with platinum pieces for your team. The barbershop lets you configure your players' hair for a small fee, the most expensive, of course, being the $50 Afro. At times, it seems like customizing your players is deeper and more interesting than the basketball itself. The game also has a gambling feature that lets you bet on your team in several different categories.   The gameplay in Street Hoops is forgettable and almost seems like an afterthought thrown in after Activision had acquired a ton of different music and clothing licenses. There's very little depth to be found here, and the game has the simplicity of a 16-bit-era NBA game with none of the challenge. On most difficulty settings, the computer can't put up a decent fight on defense, leaving you open to fast-break the ball up court with nothing in your way. In the event that you do have to get around a defender, you can simply pound on the juke button repeatedly, which will almost always cause the defender to fall over, clearing your path. On defense, stripping the ball from computer players is, again, a matter of button mashing and positioning your player properly. The game gives you a finer level of control by letting you select which move set you want each player to have, and it gives you a toggle button on offense that, when pressed, makes the face buttons trigger different fancy moves. However, the standard fancy move you get without holding down any buttons works just fine. Like NBA Street, Street Hoops attempts to award you for flashy play. A momentum meter builds and catches on fire when one side is completely full, giving players improved stats and unlimited turbo for a short period of time. Playing the game with another person avoids most of the stupidity found when playing against the computer, but the lack of useful strategy (beyond the obvious ""pass the ball across the court and dunk it before the defense has time to set up"") still makes the game a little too straightforward.  The GameCube version of Street Hoops is a bit cleaner than previous versions of the game. It still has a basic, low-poly look, but the texture quality isn't as blurry. The players move well but look quite bad, and given the game's heavy focus on emulating real-life clothing lines, you'd think a little more care would have been used when putting those clothes and logos into the game. The court textures look reasonably clean. The game's soundtrack is packed with tracks from artists like Cypress Hill, Xzibit, Smut Peddlers, and many more. Commentary is handled by a Los Angeles radio personality named Big Boy, who tosses in so much rap and street slang that it all sounds forced and phony. Thankfully, the game lets you adjust several different sound levels, so you can turn the announcing off.   Street Hoops is, quite simply, poor. The simplistic and boring gameplay makes it seem like the developer spent more time making sure the licensed clothing fit into the game than making sure that the basketball gameplay had any merit to it. If you were a fan of Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups for the Atari 2600, or any other game where the main function is dressing people up in various clothes, then Street Hoops is nonstop excitement. But anyone looking for basketball, arcade-style or otherwise, would be better served by NBA Street, NBA 2K3, or just about any other GameCube basketball game. "
2308,Dragon Age: Origins,5.0,1,"Dragon Age: Origins' most intriguing characters, so you might have been excited to learn of her return in that role-playing game's newest downloadable content, Witch Hunt. Sadly, you should temper your expectations: Witch Hunt is a lifeless escapade without wit, soul, or character, with Morrigan herself appearing in a cameo so brief that she might as well have not appeared at all. The contemptuous apostate mage is simply a MacGuffin--an abstract plot device that provides a reason for you and your party members to embark on a simple fetch quest that's explained with as little dialogue as possible. The story, such as it is, fizzles long before it reaches its limp climax, and its blandness is barely veiled by easy and predictable combat. A few odd moments jump out to remind you what made Dragon Age: Origins so wonderful, such as an enjoyable battle versus a creepy, multilegged beast and its minions. But these are small delights in a short, disappointing adventure that isn't worth the $7 asking price.         You start the hunt by importing a Dragon Age character or creating a new one, at which point you are whisked to Flemeth's door, where apparently a mysterious figure has been sighted. As it turns out, it isn't Morrigan--it's a Dalish elf called Ariane, who believes Morrigan has stolen a tome of some importance from her clan. It's a convenient reason for her to join your party, though she has very little to offer in the way of conversation from that point forward; most of her lines are plot-driven, revolving around an ancient word with unknown meaning and the scattered pieces of a vital object. Later, a mage joins your quest for even flimsier reasons, and surprisingly, he has even less personality than the dull, characterless Ariane. Your party is rounded out by a mabari hound, which means you at least get a full party, though his origin is never explained, and he comes across as the easiest way to round out the party without having to explain another character's presence or write additional dialogue. The voice acting gets the job done, but it isn't up to the standards set by the main game and its previous DLC, though to be fair, the script calls for little beyond tossing out plot elements. It's all filling in the blanks without a lick of creativity, just so you can reach an insulting ""cliff-hanger"" that apparently sets up events in Dragon Age 2--but does little else.      And so you set out to find Morrigan for purposes only vaguely explained, starting in a library at the Circle of Magi's tower. You run into an old friend from the main game here, though his presence isn't explained and comes across as a feeble attempt at fan service. Your main goal in the library isn't to chat with your pals, however, but to click on a bunch of bookcases until you can shift the adventure into a higher gear. Once the quest gets moving along, however, you find that the highest gear never reaches the speeds Dragon Age: Origins is capable of reaching. You explore a few areas, and they look quite lovely and provide a pleasant backdrop to the flurry of particles and explosions your colorful spells and skills emit. Unfortunately, the enemies you meet as you slash and claw your way through these nice environs don't put up much of a fight. You slice up the usual suspects on your travels, but you won't need to fiddle with your party's behavior patterns or perform any micromanagement. A menacing monstrosity provides a few momentary thrills, but while this great-looking boss lends Witch Hunt some combat variety, you needn't fear defeat, for it never ventures near.        You can finish Witch Hunt in around 90 minutes, but that's 90 minutes you should devote to Dragon Age: Origins' other, better DLC. Even Morrigan herself seems bored by the whole thing, displaying little of her signature sneering wit in the precious few moments she appears onscreen. The main game is, at its core, fun to play, and so you may still squeeze some amusement from the simple battles and appreciate the obscure hint of events to come. But even the most fanatical Dragon Age enthusiasts will come away bewildered by a brief and hollow addition to a universe that surely must have greater mysteries to reveal than this.    "
17,Lords of the Fallen,5.0,1,"There are a lot of elements that might be said to define Souls-like games, but high on the list has to be the genre’s particular approach to pacing. As a group of action-RPGs, they’re defined first by periods of growing, ratcheting tension. You fight through long areas filled with tough enemies, with each one dropping ""souls"" that you can spend to level up your character, which you risk losing if you die before you reach a safe place where you're able to spend them.Following the build of tension is the release, when you finally make it to the safety of a checkpoint, stopping to refill your health, enhance your character, and catch your breath before setting out into danger again. You're constantly making the same difficult decision: Do you risk going forward for greater rewards, or return to safety and grow your strength, knowing you'll have to fight through all the dangers you just faced once again?Though Lords of the Fallen ticks off many items from the list of things that Souls-like games are known for, it's the ebb-and-flow pacing, or rather the lack of it, that vexes the most. There's a combination of elements at play--the game's meandering level design, the spongy enemies you face as you progress, the uneven checkpoint and death systems--that creates a series of long and frustrating slogs. Lords of the Fallen is a game that has all the right Souls-like elements on-hand, but never quite gets the proportions right.The main element that sets Lords of the Fallen apart is the Umbral realm, an alternate dimension that sits on top of the world you see as you play through the game. As a Dark Crusader adventuring across the world in hopes of stopping the return of an evil god, you have the unique capability of interacting with and even entering the Umbral. And it's through the Umbral that you can actually cheat death--when you take too much damage, you're knocked into the Umbral dimension rather than killed outright, giving you a second chance to heal and survive.Often a dead end, large gap, or blocked path can be negotiated by entering the Umbral, where platforms or ladders that don't appear in the real world might exist, so venturing between the two worlds is a major focus. Accessing that alternate dimension is done with your Umbral Lamp, which you'll use in both exploration and combat. You can use the lamp to zap yourself straight into the Umbral proper (but not back to the real world; that's done with special corpses you'll have to seek out), or just raise it to get a glimpse at what's ahead in the alternate dimension.When you gaze into the Umbral, however, it gazes back. It's filled with monsters who are normally not part of your reality, but who materialize and threaten you within the Umbral (or if you hold the veil open too long with your lamp). In fact, the longer you spend there, the more dangerous it becomes. Enemies hunt you, appearing in front and behind at intervals, with their numbers increasing over time. You're also uniquely vulnerable in the Umbral because you can be fully killed, which sends you back to the last checkpoint, or ""vestige,"" you visited. What's more, while you're in the real world, enemies in the Umbral are invisible and can't interact with you. But while you're in the Umbral, the creatures of the real world can still see you--and hurt you.The Umbral is a frightening place where even the walls and ground are alive and pulsating, and hungry creatures stalk your every move. The Umbral helps to make Lords of the Fallen feel enormous and alive in an eerie way, while providing some inventive opportunities for navigation and puzzle-solving at key moments. As an addition to the usual Souls-like formula, the Umbral is a great idea. It can help you survive a mortal blow, but once you're forcibly thrown into it, the dangers you face only increase, and you're hunted as long as you're there.However, in practice, the Umbral only adds to Lords of the Fallen's underlying issues. It contributes to throwing off the pacing of exploring the game's world and adds to, rather than alleviates, frustrations in combat.The most egregious pacing issue is in the level design. The game takes you through a variety of dark fantasy locales that are all suitably ravaged and horrific, and when paired with frequent leaps into the Umbral, they create a frightening place to explore. But while Lords of the Fallen's locations are long on atmosphere, they're also sprawling and twisting in a way that makes them painful to navigate.The primary problem is the checkpoint system. As in other Souls-likes, every so often in Lords of the Fallen, you'll come across a vestige. Here, you can level up, fast travel to other vestiges, and rest, which refills your health and the healing charges in your Sanguinatrix (read: Estus Flask), while also respawning all the enemies in the area.Vestiges you find in the world are permanent, but they're few and far between. However, you can also create your own checkpoints at specific places by placing an item called an Umbral Seed in a flower bed found in the Umbral.As an idea, the Umbral Seeds sound like a potential improvement on the usual Souls-like approach to checkpoints, but they're actually a mess. Seeds are rare, mostly coming from defeating bosses, and if you don't have one, you can't create a checkpoint.Couple this lack of checkpoints with levels that pile tough enemies together in rapid succession and it’s a recipe for frustration. Many times, when you enter a new area, you'll jump into a mini-boss fight against an enemy that's not quite as tough as Lords of the Fallen's main bosses, but tough enough. Soon after you defeat these enemies, you'll start seeing them in levels as regular enemies.The thing is, Lords of the Fallen has a tendency to reward killing a big former-boss enemy with another one just ahead. And another one after that. And another after that. Stacking enemies like these in a row means long, slow fight after long, slow fight, where a mistake or two means death--and that means redoing all those other long, slow fights.Now throw in extensive side paths, Umbral detours, and shortcuts that take you into cul-de-sacs in every level, often without you realizing it. These areas are just as dangerous as the main pathway and look just as important, but mostly just hand out weapons and armor. On numerous occasions, I lost hours in Lords of the Fallen to side areas that didn't matter, full of battles that weren't necessary, usually rewarding me with weapons my character stats couldn't handle.Some Umbral flower beds are placed in extremely inopportune spots, as well. There are flower beds left in the middle of groups of enemies, for example, so that if you use a seed, you'll wake up surrounded by adversaries; but you also don't know how long it'll be until the next bed. Sometimes you'll find a flower bed just before a room filled with difficult enemies, and then another bed on the other side, so that you might feel like you wasted your seed on the weaker position. What's more, you can only have one seed planted at a time, forcing you to sacrifice your old checkpoint for a new one--so you better hope you're picking a place that's actually useful.It's possible to buy more Vestige Seeds from an Umbral vendor in the main hub area, but they're not exactly cheap, so this is a running tax on currency you would otherwise spend on leveling up. I made sure I always had seeds on-hand after too many instances of losing huge amounts of progress to the lack of a checkpoint.Lords of the Fallen's levels are so full of irritating, lengthy fights, with so few rewards in the form of safe places for a breather, that at some point I started just sprinting past whole hordes of enemies. It's generally quicker, easier, and less tedious to just run for it, even in new areas, and blow past a bunch of arduous and time-consuming minor battles to try to find a flower bed and skip them altogether. There's no increasing tension followed by sweet relief in Lords of the Fallen: just a series of slogs. The messy checkpoints and confusing level design undercut what fun there might have been in exploring the beautiful world of Lords of the Fallen, and it receives few additional favors from its combat.As with other Souls-likes, Lords of the Fallen focuses on players doing slow, heavy attacks, blocking incoming strikes with shields, and slipping past blows with a dedicated dodge move. In most ways, the combat feels pretty standard to the genre, and Lords of the Fallen is at its best when it's putting you through battles against interesting and weird boss enemies who tend to oscillate between towering corrupted knights and twisted demonic monsters. And yet pacing issues persist even in the combat, as every battle, from skirmishes with the game's common foes to titanic clashes with its best bosses, seems to take forever.There's a bit of a joke in the souls community that if you're having trouble with a boss, try dodging left--often it's a simple way to slip under attacks and can turn seemingly impossible battles into trivial tangles. In Lords of the Fallen, you don't even need to dodge left if you dodge at all. The dodging system is incredibly forgiving, providing you a ton of invincibility frames within the animation to avoid all damage from an attack, often even if you dodge late or poorly. Generally, dodging is so effective that there's rarely any need to use the game's blocking or parrying systems. Dodge left, attack, win fight.With dodging so incredibly forgiving, it's pretty easy to get the sense of a fight, even against a tough boss, after a few tries. But Souls-likes are supposed to be difficult, right? You can't just steam-roll a boss by slipping past every single attack and laying into them during the openings. These things are supposed to challenge players, to give them a sense of accomplishment--to take many tries.You can see where the issue develops. To compensate for the extremely generous (and, it must be noted, extremely fun to use) dodge, Lords of the Fallen puts the brakes on the speed with which you can take an enemy down. Sure, you can slip past four or five swings and get in an attack or two when there's an opening, but it feels like the health pool on every enemy, and especially bosses, is massive. So your one or two hits, especially with lighter, one-handed weapons, feel about as effective as whipping rocks at a T-Rex.This is why running past huge groups of enemies in search of a checkpoint becomes the go-to strategy. When you run into an enemy you previously faced as a boss, you know not only is that thing going to hit you really hard if you screw up dodging its attacks, but that you're going to have to plink away at it for a really long time. That'd be fine if Lords was throwing one or two of these fights at you and then rewarding you with a rest or a shortcut back to an earlier position so you can skip those fights in the future, but it doesn't. Instead, you're rewarded with fight after fight that moves like mud.Boss fights suffer from this pace-killer as well, because they overcompensate for your ridiculous dodge ability by dragging things out until you make a mistake. There are some really impressive bosses in Lords of the Fallen, many of which have great move sets and provide real challenges. But they all last well beyond excitement and into frustration because every one of them continues to test you long after you feel like you've achieved mastery of the situation, simply because they take forever to kill. Lords of the Fallen boss fights start to feel like Groundhog Day loops, where you know every move before it happens, but you're still stuck there.There's a parry system in Lords of the Fallen as well, but the way it works, coupled with the efficacy of the dodge, means it's often best to ignore it. On paper, parrying is a worthwhile system with great effects. Perfectly timing your blocks lowers an enemy's ""posture,"" marked by a small meter that appears near their health, and once it's emptied, you get a chance to perform a big Grievous attack, much like a Dark Souls riposte or Bloodborne Visceral attack. Regular attacks and charged attacks also lower posture, just like the parry systems in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice or Lies of P, so this is something you want to be looking for opportunities to do in fights. Or it would be, until you realize it's not nearly worth the risk.The penalty for blocking anything, even with a perfect parry, is that you suffer from ""withered health,"" which turns a chunk of your health bar gray. Withered health is another cool-sounding system on paper, playing like Bloodborne's rally system or Lies of P's guard health system. You can get your withered health back as regular health for landing strikes on enemies, but if you take a hit, you lose all your withered health, plus the regular health you would have lost normally. So blocking and parrying can help you tank a hit, but also build up a health debt that forces you to be extra careful.The trouble is that the rewards never make the risks of the withered health system worth it. Usually, blocking an attack just leads you into getting hit by the next one, costing you the withered health and more. The timing required for dodging is hugely more forgiving than that required for parrying and comes with no penalty, so standing your ground is only necessary in a few edge cases.And this is where the good idea of that second chance of landing in the Umbral upon death loses its luster as well. When you travel into the Umbral, you get your health back, but half of it is withered, so you immediately have to start fighting to get back up to full strength. Any healing you do in the Umbral is less effective as well, with some of it being withered. Okay, sure, fine ideas, providing you a second chance on death but making the situation more risky--except the Umbral has more enemies than the real world and they spawn in around you over time. Often, a bad situation just gets worse when you wind up in the Umbral because the number of foes you're facing gets compounded.So now you're dealing with the thing that killed you, plus more enemies, and they all take a bunch of hits to kill, and you're losing any health that's withered on top of whatever a regular hit would cost you, with less room to maneuver because the enemy density is higher. That Umbral second chance is now more like an Umbral gang beating. And that's if the enemy who killed you doesn't just immediately slay you as soon as you stand up, slapping away your worthless withered health along with the rest of your real health.There are a lot of potentially cool things about Lords of the Fallen. Its world is vast and beautiful, with a story of a series of religious zealots falling to corruption and ambiguous characters making you wonder if what's defined by orthodoxy as evil is really so bad. The Umbral dimension itself is an excellent addition that makes every location creepier and more interesting than it otherwise would be. And combat can be fun, especially against the game's most imaginative and challenging bosses.But the game just can't get the proportions right. The fun of risk-and-reward gameplay comes from actually earning the rewards; if the rewards aren't good enough, or if the risk is too heavy, the fun turns to frustration. For all of Lords of Fallen's good ideas, it struggles to make the payoff worthy of the investment. Its meandering level design and slogging encounters turn challenge into tedium, leaving a feeling that getting up and doing something else would be time better spent."
702,Giga Wrecker,4.0,0,"If not for the studio logo when you start up Giga Wrecker Alt, you'd never know it was made by one of the most successful video game developers in history. It isn't just that this lacks any connection to Game Freak's iconic Pokemon series. Giga Wrecker Alt, an enhanced port of the 2017 PC release, doesn't have the cohesion present in the Pokemon games, and its blend of clever ideas is held back by poor implementation.The core mechanic behind Giga Wrecker is novel: You destroy robots to gather debris, which can then be formed into objects like blocks, weapons, and tools. These help you to resolve both platforming and puzzles, and the giant debris blocks also make a handy melee weapon against the bots. The bigger the debris pile you carry around with your cybernetic arm, the better it will serve as a bludgeon against larger robots, and the more and bigger tools you can create.For example, many puzzle rooms have pressure-sensitive switches that are only activated by the maximum size debris block. The solution, then, comes from taking down progressively heftier machines to build a big enough stockpile. Junk piles can also be cut or drilled through to make platforms, or a block piece can be used to deflect a laser. It's an inventive idea that merges combat, puzzle-solving, and platforming under a single gameplay hook.However, it isn't long before the concept meets its limitations. Giga Wrecker often asks more of you than it's willing to give, making for an unforgiving and frustrating experience. Most pervasively, the physics systems at the heart of the game are inconsistent. Even when you already know the solution, you'll spend a significant amount of time performing it over and over waiting for the pieces to fall in place just so. Then, with the puzzle resolved, you'll be asked to escape to a door without falling into an instant-kill trap, which is where poor checkpointing issues arise--if you fail, you'll need to begin the puzzle again. At one point, I solved a particularly tricky puzzle and then jumped onto a moving platform, only to have the camera pull away to highlight that I had solved it. By the time camera control was restored, I was in a spike pit, dead.The checkpointing that does exist is odd and erratic. Since the physics-based puzzles are prone to unresolvable errors, each major room includes a reset point highlighted in noticeable hot pink. These are activated by pressing up, which leads to unintentional activation on a fairly regular basis. If you don't hit these reset points, though, you'll find yourself sometimes checkpointed at the start of a puzzle and other times checkpointed when you first entered a room and repeating a dialogue sequence. I got in the habit of hitting a reset point as soon as I entered any room, just to make sure I set the checkpoint there.Even putting aside unlucky moments and fiddly checkpoints, though, the platforming can be a struggle. The controls are imprecise, and you'll often continue to slide after releasing a direction or move an uncertain distance from a light, fine-tuned tap. Inching closer to an edge to prepare for a tricky jump will occasionally result in going right over it.The platforming and puzzles are scattered across three major areas joined by a central hub. Progression generally comes from solving rooms to activate nodes, which then open up doorways locked behind a set number of those nodes. Rinse, repeat. The overworld map that shows how these areas connect is nonsensical, only giving the vaguest idea of direction to find the next doorway, but the areas are small enough that memorization eventually sets in.The one area that works as intended is combat, but this element is underserved. The robot destruction is mostly about gathering debris, so enemies are few and far between, and you dispatch them with environmental hazards more than your limited arsenal of weapons. The more challenging combat comes from the boss battles: three named characters with two battles apiece, followed by a single final battle. These rare moments are where the combat shines, relying on the same debris-gathering mechanic but challenging you to gather it by countering their moves in between dodging devastating attacks. These fights are challenging, and as opposed to the rest of the game, they leave you with a feeling of accomplishment rather than exhausted relief.Even putting aside unlucky moments and fiddly checkpoints, the platforming can be a struggle.While much of the game grows more complex over time, the story actually becomes simpler and more accessible. You're put into the shoes of Reika Rekkeiji, a young girl who barely survived an apparent robot apocalypse thanks to an emergency surgery that gave her a cybernetic arm. The art style helps reinforce Reika's mindset, as her cyborg arm has a spindly sense of body horror. It looks twisted and unnatural on her frame, and as she starts to encounter humanoid ""Astra"" class robots, their appendages are similarly awkward, elongated, and misplaced on their bodies. It's a subtle and creepy way of showing rather than telling one of the story's major themes.Giga Wrecker uses some staid plot tropes, like the classic amnesiac protagonist, and at first it feels like showing up to a book club without having done the reading. Characters make multiple inside references to the ongoing robot conflict with such ease and familiarity that I genuinely wondered if it was adapted from an existing franchise. As the story proceeds it slowly clarifies itself. It all carries a distinct tone of anime melodrama, complete with soul-searching soliloquies about the nature of war and violence. It isn't breaking new ground, but it's fine enough.Despite its glimmers of inventiveness and artistry, Giga Wrecker Alt is its own worst enemy. The puzzles are too frustrating and the platforming too fiddly to recommend it. Game Freak set out to make something very different than the series it's most known for, and the studio's trademark creativity shines through in brief moments. The execution on the whole, though, is sadly lacking."
2589,Prototype 2,8.0,2,"Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 back in April, and the transition has been kind to this brutal open-world adventure. The biggest difference between this version and its console brethren is the slightly improved visuals. Greater draw distance and a higher frame rate showcase your murderous rampage in a more impressive light. Because the technical aspects have been translated with nary a hitch, it's easy to lose yourself in the destructive glee of this unrepentant sequel. Prototype 2 isn't the least bit novel, but it's so utterly ridiculous that it's hard to wipe the smile from your face.         One thing you should keep in mind is that Prototype 2 is at its best with a controller. The fast-paced fighting and empowering exploration come together seamlessly when you have a couple of analog sticks and responsive buttons. If you're using a keyboard, you can still blow through the papier-mache enemies, but the actions don't play out as smoothly. Holding down three keys to glide through the city takes a bit of finger gymnastics, and zeroing in on one attacker in a crowd is even tougher with a mouse. It's easy enough to get used to these quirks with a little practice, but Prototype 2 doesn't feel as as natural with a keyboard and mouse.      In contrast to the devil-may-care attitude showcased in the majority of the adventure, the story does take itself seriously. A military force has quarantined a major metropolis under the guise of protecting citizens from a viral outbreak, but their occupancy is far from altruistic. In reality, they are conducting bioweapon research, and the people are just unlucky cattle being led to slaughter. It's a morbid situation that makes it satisfying to kill your opposition--defense contractor Blackwatch--as you hunt down the higher-ups who ordered this atrocity.     The initial rush you feel when the central plot comes into focus dissipates as you learn more about the conspiracy. Evil stereotypes permeate the cast of characters, but even though there's proper motivation to murder them all, you rarely feel as if you understand whom you're tracking down. Scenes of redemption toward the end of the story breathe life into some of these individuals, but by that point you won't even care what happens to the villains. While character development is lacking, the storytelling is interesting. Most of the dirty details surface when you consume certain people, and the flashes of memory piece together a terrifying puzzle about the inner machinations of power-obsessed heretics who rarely question their horrific actions.          Dialogue-rich sequences explain your objectives before each mission. Plentiful swearing and unrestrained anger highlight most of these conversations, and the vulgar cutscenes force the carefree action to take a backseat far too often. Furthermore, protagonist James Heller holds his hand to his ear and slowly walks around when a contact talks to him, contrasting wildly with the crazed sprinting and leaping that make up his normal locomotion. Problems with the story aside, the artistic style used in the many cutscenes is certainly eye-catching. High-contrast black and white with flashes of color (blue eyes, red flames) add a dramatic pitch to the proceedings. This style is also used when your health gets low in combat and does a great job of communicating your struggles without obscuring your view.     Prototype 2 takes place in an open-world environment where you can run wherever you wish without artificial barriers reining you in. From the moment you're set loose, you don't need any urging to sprint through this city gone to ruin. Movement is free-flowing and empowering. Running up the sides of buildings, bounding down blocks in a single leap, and gliding like a manic flying squirrel make for quicker transport than a tired vehicle ever could, and the unabashed joy of careening through this virus-plagued town is hard to deny. Things do become a little tricky when precision is necessary, though thankfully you rarely have to move with exactitude. Instead, you sprint pell-mell until you crave the sweet satiation of your bloodthirst, and in a snap you're beating a poor sucker so badly his mother wouldn't be able to recognize him.          The convergence of movement and combat makes for instances of unrepentant brutality. While gliding over occupied streets, you might spy a fear-mongering soldier down below. Lock on to him from your safe vantage in the sky, and with a tap of a button, grab his squirming body before he has a chance to scream for help. With one more tap of a button, you can pound him into the unforgiving cement, hurl him into his fellow troops, or infect him with a viral bomb that causes him to explode in a fountain of blood, and then flee from the scene as if you were never there.     There's little reason to perform such an act other than the delicious enjoyment you get from tormenting those weaker than you. As your opposition becomes better equipped and more plentiful, the door opens for even more ridiculous sequences of gleeful violence. Like an anthropomorphic arrow of hatred, you propel yourself from tormenting tanks on the ground to hellfire helicopters in the air, mashing them into a flaming ball or ripping off their imposing guns to lay waste to those stupid enough to tag along beside them. Eventually, you gain the ability to pilot these craft, and though moving is slow going compared to the chaotic sprinting you're used to, it's a fair trade-off considering the impressive firepower you're given access to. Destruction exists everywhere in Prototype 2; you just have to decide in what way you want those who challenge you to perish.     Prototype, so you no longer have to contend with the finger gymnastics the more powerful moves demanded. Instead, your kills are varied and gruesome, and it's so easy to initiate the moves that you happily test out different combinations while dead bodies pile up at your feet.          There's a sadistic joy to brutally murdering your enemies in Prototype 2. You're blessed with such a powerful repertoire that you can cause excruciating pain with ease. Although much of the excitement exists because of this savagery, your enemies are such pushovers that you rarely feel the satisfaction of a hard-fought victory. In many ways, Prototype 2 encompasses the design philosophy normally associated with quick-time events (even though that control method doesn't often surface). In other games, frequent QTEs make you feel like a badass without much work, and that sense of unlimited power is Prototype 2 in a nutshell. Your overpowered enemies keel over after barely even scratching your durable skin, so you tear them to shreds without any fear of dying. Even when you start a New Game+ on the unlockable Insane difficulty, you progress through missions without any serious opposition.   Your biggest challenge comes from overcoming twitchy controls and a camera that falters under certain circumstances. Killing dozens of enemies is no problem in Prototype 2, but when you want to hurt just one attacker, things become a bit more complicated. You move so quickly that homing in on just one man is a crapshoot, and this means you might pick up a box or stray rocket launcher when you desperately need to grab on to a specific person instead. In tight spaces, the camera doesn't know how to properly showcase the actions. Characters become obscured behind obstacles because your view zooms in too tight, making it tricky to get your bearings. Neither of these issues is detrimental because even with hiccups you rarely confront death, but they do get in the way of the freewheeling action during the most intense moments.          These are small problems in a game that's overflowing with simple pleasures. Maybe the best of these flashes of joy come from the way you escape from the military. When you cause too much damage, troops are alerted to your presence and hunt you with extreme aggression. If you escape their line of sight and shape-shift into someone you previously consumed, they immediately call off their manhunt. In theory, this is a fine solution, but in practice, it's so delightfully illogical that it only adds to the ridiculous fun of the rest of the game. The military quits the chase abruptly and is too stupid to understand reality. So, if you transform into a scientist while running up the side of a building, no one will think twice that a medical professional is defying gravity. This leads to a number of hilarious situations in which your pursuers happily ignore gliding hobos and artillery-toting doctors while you giggle at their buffoonery.   The freedom in how you traverse the city and kill your foes is the main draw in Prototype 2, and though the missions give you the flexibility to complete them in unique ways, they lack the inventiveness that could have added variety to your objectives. Just about every mission boils down to exterminating a person of questionable morals, so you rarely have to exert much effort in planning your attacks. At least stealth elements do give you a new way to approach things. Picking off enemies (either by consuming them or planting a viral bomb in their skull) is deviously satisfying and gives some challenge to completing missions even though stealth is usually optional. Plus, secondary objectives give you bonuses for completing missions in specific ways, ensuring you can't just rely on the same technique if you want to excel.        Outside of missions, there are oodles of collectibles to nab. The map sends out a radar pulse in the approximate location of hidden black boxes and secret lairs, so you don't have to explore much to uncover them. But it's fun to traverse the city locating every spare part, and the upgrades you receive for doing so are worth your while. The pacing is handled well in Prototype 2. You learn new abilities every few hours, so you always have something new to play around with, and bumping your stats makes you stronger and faster as you get deeper into the journey. It's a shame the challenge doesn't scale with your newfound powers, but that doesn't detract from the excitement of learning new ways to tear your enemies to pieces.   Prototype 2 is a safe sequel. It doesn't add anything particularly new or inventive to the genre, but small tweaks make it more accessible than the original game. Most importantly, it's an unabashedly fun adventure that doesn't have any doubt about what it wants to be. This is a game about killing enemies in an open-world environment, and little stands in the way to hinder your enjoyment. Mindless violence is all the rage in Prototype 2, which makes for a stupid yet entertaining experience.    "
3402,DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue,8.0,2,"DeathSpank. The basic combat and visual style have made the transition virtually unchanged, but the consistently funny story is a worthy continuation of the events from the first game. Unfortunately, the problems present in the original release are still here. There isn't much depth to the combat, and there are a number of small bugs that throw a wrench in your spokes of justice. But these issues will cause you to stumble for only a few moments before you're back on your feet. This gung-ho adventure exudes charm, and the thoughtful ending gives a satisfying conclusion to DeathSpank's journey.         The story begins immediately after the events of the first game. DeathSpank has found himself trapped in a minimum-security prison, but bars can contain a world-class hero for only so long. In no time flat, you've made short work of your captors' feeble attempt to keep you locked up, and you're off to finish what you started. Five enchanted thongs are being worn by people with bad intentions, and you must fell these fashionable villains to keep the cursed underwear from spreading more unhappiness in the land. As in the first game, the story is largely inconsequential, relying more on its irreverent humor than a gripping plot to push you deeper into the adventure. Thankfully, the humor is just as consistent as it was in the original release, making light of war, cannibalism, and other, less-dour topics. What elevates this narrative beyond that of the original is the powerful conclusion that wraps everything up. You have a choice in how your adventure ends, and both options paint an interesting portrait of DeathSpank.     A large part of Thongs of Virtue involves talking to various characters in optional but highly amusing dialogue trees. This aspect is unchanged from the original release, but the relevance of these conversations has been enhanced. A greater percentage of quests in the sequel require you to puzzle out a solution, which means you have to pay careful attention to the ranting of these eccentric citizens. A hooker with a heart of gold uses clever wordplay and feminine wiles to blind you from the truth, and you need to deceive at least three different people to learn a restaurant chain's birthday song. Quests such as these add a cerebral quality that was largely missing from the first game. If your button-mashing finger is quicker than your problem-solving mind, you can buy hints for particularly tricky puzzles to point you in the right direction. The hint system is constructed with as much intelligence as the rest of the writing, letting you choose just how much help you want. The first clue gives you a gentle nudge in the right direction, but you can purchase detailed descriptions if you're still stumped. It's a smart system that gives Thongs of Virtue a brainy bend that complements the hack-and-slash gameplay quite well.      In combat you have eight buttons to map your weapons, potions, and magical spells to. It may seem like overkill to have multiple melee weapons at your fingertips, but there's a method to this madness. By alternating your attacks, you build up your combo meter, and this is important to keep in mind when fighting foes that exceed your current level. But even with a simple combo system, fighting in Thongs of Virtue is just as shallow as it was in the first game. Most enemies fall after just one or two swings from your strongest weapon, so you don't need much skill to quash those who oppose you. There is at least more versatility in your ranged weapons. A healthy assortment of guns, bazookas, and even grenades give you plenty of different ways to take down your enemies from afar, and you even have to worry about ammunition at times. You may not want to fire all of your shotgun rounds on lesser enemies when a boss is waiting for you around the corner. Combat is still not dynamic enough to be a serious draw in Thongs of Virtue, but at least it's not as repetitive as it was in the first game.        An eye-catching visual design ensures that each location you visit carries with it its own feel. The early portions of Thongs of Virtue take place in a grimy prison yard and a bullet-riddled war zone, which is certainly a jolt for those expecting the pastoral lands from the original game. But even these dank environments contain pleasant sights, most notably a few picturesque buildings in a decrepit city. Other portions of the game have a more colorful view, from the icy hills of the North Pole to the sweltering heat of an expansive desert. As pleasing as the environments are to look at, there are sometimes problems with movement. There are moments when buildings and other obstacles prevent you from seeing your attackers. Because the combat is so simple, this rarely results in death, but it is frustrating being ambushed by enemies you can't see. More troubling are a few bugs that trap DeathSpank in place. This happened a couple of times during the adventure, usually when traveling near the edge of the screen, and the hero couldn't move until we were killed or restarted the game.      DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue proves that some formulas don't need a drastic overhaul to be fun. The small tweaks liven up the gameplay, but it's the goofy story and striking visuals that provide the most pertinent lure. Don't be scared off by the $15 price tag, either. This long adventure can stretch for more than 15 hours if you complete every quest, and there are so many characters to meet that things never get boring. It would be nice to see more in-depth combat, but that's not the point of this adventure. Thongs of Virtue is a simple journey that pushes humor to the forefront, and it's a refreshing change of pace for people looking for lighter fare. Being a hero may not be easy, but it's certainly funny.  "
410,Ori and the Will of the Wisps,9.0,2,"Eight months after its initial release, Ori and the Will of the Wisps received some impressive technical upgrades on the Xbox Series X and Series S. The optimized version of the game hits an ultra-smooth 60-120 frames per second on both next-gen consoles at varying resolutions. It's a huge comeback for a game that was initially subject to wonky technical issues. In the next generation, Ori sheds its graphical hangups and becomes more impressive for it.Both consoles have frame rate-prioritizing ""performance"" and visually minded ""fidelity"" modes, but neither one feels like a compromise. On the Series S, you get to choose between 1080p with HDR at 120fps, or an upscaled 4K at 60fps. On the Series X, you can choose to play the game in 4K with HDR at a performance-focused 120fps, or goose the graphics in a supersampled 6K resolution, running at 60fps with HDR. Regardless of your settings, Will of the Wisps also benefits from enhanced load times and improved audio fidelity.Supersampling, for anyone perplexed by the idea of playing an Xbox One-era game in 6K, processes an image at a higher resolution, then compresses it down to your TV or monitor's resolution. You know how a screenshot gets blurry when you make it ten times larger? It's kind of like the opposite of that… But happening in real-time because it's a video game and not a static image. The thing you need to know is, when using 6K mode in Will of the Wisps, you aren't actually playing in 6K, but what you are playing does get a nice visual boost over the standard 4K setting.In anecdotal, eyeball-based terms, the colorful forests of Ori's opening hours look better in the 6K mode. Environmental elements like flowers hanging off walls and thorny spikes stick out more sharply against the background. These are small enough differences that you probably won't notice them during an intense platforming challenge. If you stop and look around, though, you'll appreciate what you see. Will of the Wisps still looks incredible in 4K; it's colorful, vibrant, and sharp. If you want to wring the absolute best visuals out of the Series X--or if, like me, you do not have a TV or monitor capable of rendering 4K and HDR at 120fps--6K is a nice little high-fidelity nudge.Speaking of which, let's talk about performance. When it first launched, Will of the Wisps suffered from some technical setbacks, including stutters and screen tearing due to inconsistent frame rates. Not only are those issues gone now, but the game now sets a high bar for technical performance. Its animation is silky smooth at 60 frames per second. In the first four hours, I didn't see a single, momentary hitch. As I just noted above, I tested the 6K/60Hz mode but also ran the 4K/120Hz performance mode on a TV maxing out at 60Hz, so I cannot attest to how it fares when pushed in performance mode.Beyond that, Ori and the Will of the Wisps remains an incredible action-platformer. As Steve Watts explained in GameSpot's original review earlier this year, ""While Ori is ostensibly a metroidvania, Will of the Wisps is less focused on exploration and backtracking than is typical for the genre. Your objectives are usually clear, straight lines, and shortcuts littered throughout the environments get you back to the main path quickly."" Will of the Wisps streamlines the exploration- and puzzle-heavy gameplay into something more straightforward. It retains the original's tight, graceful platforming and brings the same precision to its expanded combat systems. ""Around the mid-game I realized I had become adept at stringing together platforming and combat skills,"" Watts said, ""air-dashing and bounding between threats with balletic rhythm and barely touching the ground until the screen had been cleared.""Will of the Wisps was always an impressive visual showpiece, despite the technical flaws that initially held it back. It's more straightforward, combat-heavy flow may still put off die-hard fans of the original Ori, but there's that's a small nitpick for a game that retains its identity while finding a new flow. Most importantly for the Series X and S upgrades, next-gen hardware turns one of Will of the Wisps' original weaknesses into a point of pride, and that's worth celebrating."
4429,Fighting Legends,4.0,0,"Massively multiplayer online gaming is inherently unstable. Such games are typically released in an unfinished state as developers take advantage of a public that now expects such games to be works-in-progress. This trend has grown to the point where some online games have been barely functional on arrival. World War II Online showed up on its scheduled release date on June 6 last year but required a huge patch that replaced almost everything on the game CD before you could even begin playing. Even then, the game was bug-ridden and lacked many promised features. Anarchy Online hit stores at the end of that same month with stability issues, major lag, CD key problems, and, to top things off, a credit card registration system that initially wasn't handled on a secure server. It's hard to imagine an online game launch that could go any worse than those two.   Well, it used to be hard to imagine that. The launch of Fighting Legends, a real-time strategy/role-playing hybrid from independent development house Maximum Charisma Studios, has been even more disastrous. Bugs have been prevalent from the very beginning, and a flawed registration system and continual server problems make it a struggle just to get into the game. When you finally do fight your way inside, a combination of connection drops, bugs and associated anomalies, a half-baked game design, and a frustratingly obtuse world make you quickly decide that the battle isn't worthwhile. This is perhaps the ultimate example of an incomplete online game with more glaring defects than properly working features.   Cracks are evident right in the foundation. Bugs were so prevalent in the initial release that the game was unplayable. Just registering took more than six hours, spread over two days, as the menu system kept running into ""page not found"" dead ends. You would think that the system that allows the company to collect its $9.99 monthly fee would be the first thing to be checked out. Calls to Maximum Charisma's support line did little but run up our long-distance phone bill. Twenty-minute waits on hold were followed with generic advice about getting the most recent video card driver updates and the promise of a promptly e-mailed support guide (which didn't show up until the next day). The system never did work properly, although immoderate use of the refresh and forward buttons in our browser somehow got us through.   But it didn't get us playing. After completing the sign-up process and creating a character, everything ground to a halt on the opening screen. Our character moved as instructed for a few seconds and then froze. Forward or backward movement was impossible from that point on, although the character could be rotated in place. All other keys functioned normally, and the gameworld continued to turn. Technical support couldn't resolve this problem--nor could more than a week of phone conversations and correspondence with Maximum Charisma's top troubleshooter, consultations with our local ISP, numerous driver changes, and finally reinstalling the Windows 98 operating system. Only switching to a completely new machine and Windows XP finally got the game running. As usual with this sort of thing, there is no way to tell what caused the glitch or even whether it was fixed by the system change or something that Maximum Charisma added to one of its regular updates. Connection problems lingered, though, and the entire system went down numerous times, including a lengthy interruption in service around the holidays. Instability remains a serious concern.   When we were able to play Fighting Legends, it quickly became apparent that the design was intended to give online gamers something new and different. Maximum Charisma certainly delivers in that regard, though the company has gone so far beyond what people expect of a massively multiplayer game that the results are nearly incomprehensible. The setting is the planet Exisle, following the crash of a ""giant robotic entity"" known as Lergan, ""the cosmic seed."" This crash, which was apparently caused by a mechanical spider-janitor that had succumbed to space madness (uh-huh), freed all sorts of creatures from their suspension in ""cryojuice."" Or killed them. The back story isn't very clear on this point, and there's some mention of ghosts. What is clear is that the scriptwriters should switch off the anime.  At any rate, the survivors have formed into nine clans split among the Sky Realm, Surface Plain, and Underworld regions of Exisle. The Sky Realm is home to the Rin, Pyron, and M-Clan, while the Surface Plain features the Humans, Bear-Kats, and Bio-Mechs. The Underworld hosts the Bone Clan, Arachin, and Wee. Clan territories are separate entities that can be entered only through magical gates. Characteristics of the clans in each area roughly correspond to role-playing game alignments and the elements. The Rin, for example, are good nature lovers who use ranged weapons, while the evil Pyron are fiery warmongers. The neutral M-Clan is composed of icy magic users. You begin play by creating an avatar from one of these clans and choosing which of five archetypes to represent. Archetypes are similar to role-playing character classes. Melee characters emphasize close-quarters combat skills, MPow focus on magic, Techniq look after healing allies, Missile are best with ranged weapons, and Speed is a catch-all that takes one of the other categories and adds swiftness. Six character statistics track things such as damage ability and hit points. These scores cannot be altered initially, although you do collect experience points and level up in the same fashion as in a typical role-playing game.   The gameplay itself isn't typical. Although you guide a character around a persistent world, the focus of play blends elements of real-time strategy with role-playing. You must deploy a base, gather resources, build huts and defensive structures, and summon squad members. It is the center of all activity, including the resurrection of your avatar when necessary. Quests, treasure, and nonplayer characters exist, but the guiding premise is an ongoing war between the clans in each region of Exisle. Each group has a natural enemy, so the intent of the designers is obviously to provoke rivalries that lead to base building and combat.   It doesn't work out that way. For starters, the real-time strategy aspects are just trappings. Bases are usually deployed temporarily for the specific purpose of recruiting troops for a squad or to resurrect your avatar. Once this is done, you can tuck away the buildings with the click of a button. Base construction is also extremely expensive. You need 400 resource points to build an average structure, yet slaying the typical enemy in the early stages of the game nets you no more than two or three. It takes a very, very long time to get to the point where you can deploy most of the base huts and raise a significant army. The first dozen or so hours see you mainly wandering Exisle in search of monsters to kill for cash and experience points. This quickly gets tedious. Aside from the clunky third-person combat system, the planet is vast and sparsely populated. More time is spent running across North Dakota-sized plains than battling enemies. Other human players are also absent. It's nearly impossible to find another person playing Fighting Legends. The lone saving grace here is that most people won't get far enough into the game for their hermitlike status to become a cause for complaint.   The appearance of this seemingly limitless terrain isn't for everyone. To complement the Japanese pop-culture storyline, Maximum Charisma gave Fighting Legends a distinctive cartoon look. Characters resemble Pokémon monsters in many respects. The lineup includes all manner of cutesy creations that look like toys, from the fluffy Bear-Kats to robot frog Bio-Mechs. The 3D acceleration and use of bright, primary colors give the game a cheerful sheen, though this leans toward the garish, and too many scenes are devoid of features. Shoddy collision detection causes objects to pop up in the middle of walls and characters' feet to sink into the ground on hills. Certain of these troublesome areas can cause you to get stuck. Audio effects are also cartoonlike but vivid and effective. Monster roars and howls are distinctive, as are atmospheric sounds, such as crickets chirping at night and rain pouring down. The musical score is appropriately spacey and lighthearted.   Fighting Legends could have used at least another year in development. While the initial concept was a fascinating one--not to mention a much-needed alternative to the fantasy role-playing online monopoly--Maximum Charisma didn't take enough time to ensure that the design was solid and that the code and the company's servers could handle the operation of a persistent-world game. There remains some promise here, although the absence of a devoted following makes the future of this game cloudy at best. "
485,Maid of Sker,4.0,0,"Maid of Sker begins in earnest as you walk under a burgundy banner advertising the Sker Hotel's grand reopening. The ivy-covered building looks more castle than inn, with gray stone walls and a central spire flanked by turrets. It's an imposing piece of architecture, starkly distinct from the sun-bleached wilderness that surrounds it. Passing under that banner and into the dark and secluded inn is the playable version of that moment in a horror flick when things in idyllic suburbia go sideways, or when a shark shows up to wreck a perfectly nice day at the beach. The banner is the dividing line between Maid of Sker's ""before"" and ""after."" Unfortunately, much of the evocative promise of the before disappears the moment you enter the after.We move through this story as Thomas Evans, a composer who has traveled to Sker Point, a rocky peninsula on the southern coast of Wales, to rescue his lover Elisabeth. She grew up here, the daughter of renowned singer Prudence Williams--the titular Maid of Sker. Her father, owner of the reopening hotel on the Point, intends for Elisabeth to take up the mantle now that her famous mother has passed and to become the star attraction, drawing visitors to the isolated land. She tells Thomas that she has refused and that, as a result, her father has locked her up until she acquiesces.But as Thomas arrives at Sker's abandoned train station, it becomes clear that Sker Point has descended into supernatural chaos. Elisabeth has sent Thomas her mother's locket and asked him to compose a song that serves as a musical counterpart to the melody within. This will, in some way that remains unclear for much of the game, help defeat the ""darkness gathering here."" In his quest, Thomas needs to explore the hotel and surrounding grounds to collect four brass cylinders scattered throughout, then plug them into her father's harmonium, a massive pipe organ that dominates the hotel's central hall.But many obstacles stand between Thomas and his beloved--mostly in the form of shambling men who occupy Sker Hotel's halls, their faces hidden beneath burlap sacks. They are sightless, but their hearing is acute, and you need to be sneaky to avoid their detection, occasionally clasping your hands over your mouth to ill-timed coughs. As you slink through the Sker, finding the cylinders is your primary objective. But, on a more regular basis, you need to find keys with icons like a kraken or a musical note that match a door with a corresponding symbol, a la Resident Evil. This process is made significantly more difficult by the game's complete lack of a HUD or any UI outside the menus that might alert you when an opponent is onto you. None of the typical stealth game icons are here; don't expect a question mark or slowly-filling lightning bolt over an enemy's head to indicate suspicion. Instead, the game relies entirely on audio cues, which can be pretty confusing. For example, when you're spotted by an enemy, the game plays a panic-inducing warning sound. But, in certain areas, a discordant run of notes--which sounds strikingly similar to the ""you've been spotted"" audio cue from the Dishonored games--plays consistently as part of the soundtrack. It's loud and jarring enough that you'll likely be looking over your shoulder constantly to see who spotted you.The game is generally uncommunicative about how much noise you can make and how close to an enemy you can be when you make it. You'll occasionally pass through areas where dust particles, smoke, or other noxious fumes float in the air, and you need to hold your breath to pass through. The problem is, Thomas' coughing isn't much louder than the held breath he expels once he removes his hands from his mouth. I kept expecting enemies to notice when I exhaled, but they never did. None of this would be a problem if Maid of Sker communicated environmental information in any other way. But because audio cues are all there is, the inconsistencies are jarring.Thankfully, some of these issues are ameliorated by a mysterious, spherical device that you find shortly after arriving at the hotel. Using slender flashbulbs, which you load into the brass orb like a magazine into a gun, you can summon a blast of ghostly music. This causes every enemy in the area to cradle their heads in pain and provides a clutch path to safety when you're cornered.The game is generally uncommunicative about how much noise you can make and how close to an enemy you can be when you make it.Maid of Sker places a premium on scavenging for and conserving consumables. To heal, you need to find tonic bottles. Each use of the nifty noisemaker requires a flashbulb. You can only save at phonographs, which you'll find in specific rooms. In one of Maid of Sker's smartest design decisions, each phonograph also plays an audio log, ensuring that you won't miss critical story details. This story, which is conveyed almost entirely through these logs and muffled phone conversations with Elisabeth, is the most interesting thing Maid of Sker has to offer as its gameplay increasingly begins to grate. But even the story, whose set-up feels genuinely unique, ends in a boring, predictable place.Maid of Sker goes too far in its pursuit of a skin-of-your-teeth survival horror experience. Roughly two-thirds through the campaign, an achievement popped up to inform me that I had found all of the flashbulbs I would ever find, meaning I would not have access to Thomas' only tool for the rest of the game. Similarly, I went hours without finding a tonic bottle as a red ""you're really hurt!"" border flashed at the edges of my screen. As the frustration began to mount during one particularly punishing stealth section, I knocked the difficulty down to easy, and soon after found a tonic. Maid of Sker's default difficulty stops doling out consumables precisely when you need them most.This stinginess makes Maid of Sker a chore to play for much of its runtime on normal difficulty. One particularly irritating puzzle requires you to run through pitch-black areas in search of patches of candlelight. If you take a millisecond too long in the dark, you take damage. The solution requires a lot of trial and error, and I ended up restarting repeatedly at the most recent save point, carefully calculating my trajectory as I headed into the dark with the knowledge that one wrong move would set me back five minutes. Maid of Sker's refusal to dole out consumables at a reasonable pace also helps ensure that one of its most overt homages to Resident Evil falls completely flat. It would be a spoiler to say much more, but this deeply frustrating sequence requires strict time management and also populates a floor of the hotel with the keen-eared enemies I mentioned above. The dearth of hiding places in the inn's narrow hallways meant that I frequently found myself at the end of a dead-end hallway with a one-hit kill foe bearing down on me. No healing items. No tools. No luck.Maid of Sker pushes the horror walking sim right up to the edge of classic survival horror and, in the process, falls short of making a good version of either. It ditches the strict linearity of many of its contemporaries, like Layers of Fear 2, Moons of Madness, and Close to the Sun, in favor of a focus on exploration. This occasionally works, and there are moments when the Resident Evil influence shines through. One section, when you're tasked with tracking down a Kraken Key to match the sea monster icon on a locked door, feels like it could have been lifted directly from Capcom's series. But the consumables are so rare and enemies are so prevalent that navigating the space often becomes a chore.This story is the most interesting thing Maid of Sker has to offer as its gameplay increasingly begins to grate. But even the story, whose set-up feels genuinely unique, ends in a boring, predictable place.Add that to the fact that the game artificially extends its length by forcing you to backtrack for long stretches while offering little new to find. These sections transform the final moments of the game, which offer about two minutes of new content, into an hour-long jaunt through most of the map. When I found that the elevator I needed to use to get to my destination, which I had struggled through several hallways of frustrating stealth to return to, had been inexplicably rendered unusable by a fire, I just felt tired and ready to be done. Instead, I had a lengthy journey ahead.That's the story of Maid of Sker, as a whole. While its setting and story are initially intriguing, the experience of playing the game becomes painful over time. Enemies are plentiful and tough to avoid, and the tools that you do have at your disposal are frequently hampered by extreme item scarcity. The complete removal of UI or any helpful visual cues makes stealth encounters a chore. The moments of satisfying key-hunting are bogged down by a world that is a frustrating bore to explore. In retrospect, I wish I could stay in the ""before"" times, on the other side of that grand reopening banner. At least then, I was optimistic about what awaited inside."
1227,Hitman,7.0,2,"Sapienza's laid back atmosphere is almost the antithesis of the first episode's bustling fashion show, and this shift comes as a breath of fresh air. There's a greater variety of events to behold and more ground to cover, and you're afforded more opportunities to explore, unfettered by potential threats on the streets. While familiarizing yourself with the area, you'll regularly stumble into amusing scenes and personalities. Whether it's a street performer entertaining a group of tourists, an off-duty waiter taking a leak, or a priest who's flustered to see you barge into the middle of a confession, there are numerous vignettes that made me snicker and buy into the idea that Sapienza is a functioning community. It's disappointing that you can't enter every building given the potential advantages and entertainment they could provide, but episode two's world feels intricate and alive.It didn't take long for me to warm up to the sunlit streets and coastal views, which provided a relaxing buffer from this episode's dangerous destination: a mansion with a secret underground laboratory, protected by mafia-like guards and professional security. Your mission is to infiltrate the home, kill two targets, and destroy an experimental virus located in the heart of the lab. In traditional Hitman fashion, there are disguises to steal from unsuspecting NPCs that allow you to pass through security checkpoints and fool hired hands into thinking you're just another employee, toiling away in the opulent villa. A keen eye--or a finger on the button that triggers the x-ray vision-like Instinct mode--will help you locate tools to unlock doors or items that take out enemies, such as an exploding golf ball.Hunting for opportunities in your environment is just as critical to the Hitman experience as the act of assassinating targets. You spend most of your time sneaking and procuring said items, and while you need to be ever vigilant to avoid detection from suspicious NPCs, Hitman's unreliable AI can be easily fooled once you learn how to manipulate the way the game handles line-of-sight. It's reasonable to expect that rounding a corner and making a sharp turn in an unexpected direction would throw off a hapless guard, but it's a little silly that you can avoid detection by crouching and walking circles around objects, despite Agent 47's head poking out in plain view.Even though the enemies you circumvent aren't the brightest, there are enough of them to make your job difficult once you infiltrate the mansion's perimeter. Anyone who played the first episode will feel right at home, and potentially more at ease, despite staring danger in the face on a constant basis. Whereas the mansion in Paris was brimming with people and stuffed with hallways and tiny rooms, Sapienza's has more open space and fewer twists and turns. This looser layout potentially presents fewer hiding places--with no crowds to confuse guards and fewer windows to jump through--but this also makes the moment-to-moment action feel more manageable. That is, until you see what lurks under your feet.The underground laboratory is a totally different beast compared to the mansion. It's small and jam-packed with professional security and doctors in a space that's only big enough for a few medical trailers and crates. It's a scene that's tough to navigate and even harder to crack, but its concentrated nature makes victory all the more rewarding. With a swap of an outfit, an errant keycard, and a handy hazmat suit, you can make it into the virus' containment facility, but it requires extreme patience--any amount of aggressive behavior in the lab is met with extreme force.Though you can still rely on Hitman's forgiving radar-meets-map--which automatically tracks movements of targets and NPCs--you can use infiltration and reconnaissance across the entirety of Sapienza to locate your targets on foot. NPCs often engage in conversations that reveal the habits or locations of specific characters, but you can also pursue mini-objectives that lead you right into the lion's den, such as playing the part of a target's golf instructor. However, it's not unusual to turn a corner and organically cross paths with your target. However, they have routines, and once you realize your target is simply following a pre-programmed path rather than living in and reacting to the world as a real person might, their mystique takes a nose-dive.The mediocre AI and animations return, as does the need to repeat the same old spy tricks, but they take a backseat this time around as Sapienza and its colorful denizens take center stage.Indeed, once you understand the movements of your targets, the limitations of Hitman's enemy AI and the locations of critically useful items, the sense of wonder and immersion fade, and Hitman begins to feel more like a puzzle game. This is most evident when you dive into escalation missions.These multi-stage missions come in five parts, stacking new objectives with each round. The added challenges--like not pacifying NPCs--make completing these challenges more difficult with each round, but not necessarily more enjoyable, as you already know how to complete the unchanging objectives. It's possible to clear the first few stages of an escalation mission in a couple of minutes using the knowledge you gleaned from the episode's main mission, and it doesn't take long to grow tired of walking the same paths and resorting to the same tactics. You can look for new solutions, but it's up to you to drum up the interest in doing so as the game doesn't go out of its way to mix up the variables and guide you in new directions.Despite having a few distinct locations to explore within Sapienza, your main mission won't last long, but the variety is appreciated, with the lab feeling different from the mansion feeling different than the streets. In that regard, this episode feels far more well-rounded than the first. The mediocre AI and animations return, as does the need to repeat the same old spy tricks, but they take a backseat this time around as Sapienza and its colorful denizens take center stage. Episode two doesn't fill your plate, but it's a satisfying experience nonetheless."
3565,Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance,5.0,1,"  Beatdown: Fists of Vengeance sounds, at least on paper, like it should be a fantastic update to the tried-and-true beat-'em-up formula. You can freely roam about a city, recruit sidekicks through bribery or force, rob and interrogate people, take on foes using a fighting game-style combat system, learn new combos, and much more. You'll also be able to change your character's appearance to avoid detection from police or rival mobs. Unfortunately, none of these interesting design ideas were executed well, leaving you with a game that feels half-baked and suffers from terrible pacing.         Beatdown's story involves five members of a moblike outfit run by a man named Zanetti. You arrive at the scene of a drug deal to find that everyone involved is dead. Your little group ends up getting double-crossed and splits up in order to escape the heat from your own gang (who thinks you've turned on them), rival gangs that want you dead, and the police, who are also after you. From there, each character's storyline goes on its own arc as you explore the dingiest depths of the city of Las Sombras, trying to clear your name and escape the heat that's been put on you.      You'll begin by heading to a local bar that serves as a safe house of sorts. The friendly bartender there offers you expensive, but health-replenishing drinks, as well as side jobs you can do for money. As you gain experience and level your character, not only will you gain points to spend on three different role-playing game-like attributes, but also you'll have the ability to learn new moves from the bartender and other characters. An informant in the bar gives you plot-related missions to carry out at the start of the game, so once you get tired of roaming around the city and engaging in side jobs or random fights, you can do what she says to advance the storyline. As you roam around the city, you can find vendors and other non-player characters who may offer you information, join your gang, offer you missions, or become hostile as you approach them.     The catch to walking around the city is that the police and rival gang members recognize you more and more as you bump into them. The recognition meters are registered crudely in the top corner of the screen as percentages. If one of these reaches 100 percent then it will result in a forced fight each time you run into a cop or rival gang. In order to throw enemies off your track (so you can walk around freely without fighting), you must constantly spend money at vendors to change clothes, hairstyles, and even get plastic surgery. This becomes burdensome over the course of the game, as it encourages you to avoid coming close to any NPCs for fear of raising your recognition meters. Even then, it's impossible to avoid NPCs sometimes, so the whole recognition mechanic ends up becoming a massive waste of money and time. In effect, you're discouraged from exploring and talking to new NPCs, which seems completely counterintuitive for a game of this type.      Each of the five characters in Beatdown has his or her own fighting style. Some are quick, while others offer brute force and power. The fighting engine offers a decent amount of depth. There's a punch and a kick button, so tapping them in certain sequences will unleash combo moves. There's also a block button and a grab button, which you can use for grappling, throwing, and disarming enemies. Enemies will pull out weapons from time to time, and there are also weapons lying on the ground, so if you can manage to pick one of these up, you can do some serious damage in a hurry. You're also able to equip an item (such as a weapon or health-replenishing food) in each of two quick slots that you can access during a fight.         Depending on the sort of fight you're engaged in, the fights in the game can offer different kinds of experiences. Random street battles are more like Final Fight--any sidekicks you may have will fight autonomously (albeit not very well) alongside you, distracting some of the opponents you may be up against. Each enemy has a visible health bar that you'll need to whittle down, and you can freely move from opponent to opponent. As you build a rapport with your sidekicks, you can perform two-man combos, but for the most part, these are more trouble to pull off than they're worth. Once all the enemies are down, you can loot their bodies for cash and items. The plot-related fights are one-on-one affairs, more like your standard fighting game. Your sidekicks stand aside while you take on enemies one at a time. Sidekicks only engage in plot-related fights if you go down. You can also pick fights with neutral NPCs. These are one-on-one fights also, but usually with a twist. Instead of knocking out your opponent, you can reduce your enemy's pride meter to zero if you're winning and before he's dead. Once the enemy's pride reaches zero, you can grab him, which then opens up a menu of options. You can force your enemies to work for you as a goon, rob them of money, interrogate them for information, or just beat them down for experience.      These moves and fights all seem pretty cool, but much like everything else in Beatdown, they sound a lot better than they actually are. In practice, the fights get repetitive and you can win a lot of them without too much thought by mashing on buttons. Interrogating random NPCs is usually pointless, as they don't offer any useful information unless interrogation is part of a specific mission that you're doing. While the excessive blood and extreme violence of the fighting might appeal to some, for most people, the shallow feel of the fights and the illusion of open-endedness will wear thin quickly. The worst part of all this is probably the pacing of the game, which is extremely stilted. While there are a number of zones and subareas to explore in Las Sombras, entering into a new zone, shop, or even a fight will incur a short loading time. If isolated, these transitions aren't so bad, but since you have to do so much exploring and fighting over the course of the campaign, the constant loading becomes irritating rather quickly and keeps you from getting into the story or into any kind of flow with the game.        Visually, Beatdown isn't all that appealing. The city of Las Sombras isn't very big, and every area of town somehow doesn't feel complete. The lack of visual cues above your head, as well as the confined spaces, makes the entire place feel more like a movie set than it does a real city. The character models offer a respectable amount of detail and animation quality, but the game does suffer from clipping and camera issues, as well as muddy textures and an uninspired art direction. From an audio standpoint, Beatdown has a relatively sparse soundtrack that isn't particularly memorable. There's some speech in the game, but most conversations are still done through plain text. The little voice acting that is available is full of cursing and adult language, which isn't bad in and of itself, but when combined with the quality of the writing, it just seems forced in order to fit the game's gritty theme. The most irritating aspect is that your character always says the same couple of things after winning a fight. After hearing the same taunt for about the hundredth time, you'll feel compelled to play the game on mute.     There is a versus mode available, but it plays out like any other plot-specific fight. You pick three characters and go up against one computer or one human opponent, and the match ends when all members of one team have been KO'd, much like Capcom vs. SNK. Of course, the fighting in Beatdown is nowhere near as fun. It's hard to say that this mode really adds all that much value to the game--you're better off playing a real fighting game if that's the sort of action you're looking for.     In the end, it seems like Beatdown tries to do a little too much. The idea of exploring a city and building up a gang while trying to duck your rivals and the police is appealing, but the way it's executed in the game leaves a lot to be desired. The features don't feel fully developed, and the constant load times you experience are frustrating. Rather than bringing the beat-'em-up genre into the modern age, playing Beatdown just makes you long for the simpler games of yore.  "
4134,Superman Returns,4.0,0,"  Superman's great at saving the world, but he sure hasn't had much success when it comes to video games. The disastrous Superman 64 was no doubt the low point in the Man of Steel's video game history, but even his highs haven't been all that high. Superman Returns: The Videogame was originally slated to release alongside the movie in June (which had its own tumultuous production saga), but it wasn't ready in time and the release date was pushed back to coincide with the DVD of the movie going on sale. Despite the delay, the game still doesn't seem to be ready, but that hasn't stopped it from being released. It's certainly not as bad as Superman 64, but it's still plenty bad. Superman Returns does do a few things well, and it does manage to be entertaining for the first hour or so, but it's all downhill from there.         For a game that's supposed to be a movie tie-in, Superman Returns sure doesn't have a whole lot in common with the film. After fighting off a rogue meteor shower and learning how to use his super abilities, Superman zooms off to outer space to find that his home planet has indeed been destroyed. On the way home he runs across Mongrul, does a bit of fighting, and then it's back to Earth. Here he'll battle Metallo, Bizarro, and, eventually, someone who was actually in the film, Lex Luthor. People who saw the movie and those who didn't will be equally frustrated with the storytelling. If you saw the movie, you'll be puzzled as to what the heck any of this has to do with the film, and if you didn't see Superman Returns, there's little chance that any of the short cutscenes will explain exactly what the heck Lex is doing with the crystals, much less why Mister Mxyzptlk wants Superman to race around the city.     Superman Returns takes place in Superman's adopted home city, Metropolis. The city consists of several large islands that lie in the middle of a lake surrounded by mountains. The city is largest on the Xbox 360, as the PlayStation 2 and Xbox are missing one of the smaller islands. You're free to go almost anywhere, from street level to thousands of feet above even the tallest building. The view from high up in the sky is breathtaking at first, and it's fun to zoom down through the clouds and wind through city streets and in between the skyscrapers at breakneck speeds. However, the fun quickly wears off when you realize that short of endlessly touring the city, there's little else to do. You can fly around and rescue kittens that are hidden around Metropolis, and that's about it. You can't fly underwater, and you can't walk in buildings.     So, other than rescuing kittens, what is there to do? Not a whole heck of a lot. The game is divided into chapters comprised of a series of objectives that only appear by flying around aimlessly until you get close enough to one to trigger it. As is evident by the way the game drags on and on, there are certainly plenty of objectives--there's just not much variety to them. Early in the game most of your time will be spent fighting robots--robots that walk, robots that roll around, and robots that fly. Later you'll be fighting evil monsters and even dragons. (If you're wondering why on Earth there are dragons in the game, you're not alone.) This monotony is occasionally broken up when you are charged with putting out building fires. And if you play long enough, you'll get to fight bad guys and put out fires. The segments where you race Mister Mxyzptlk or play as Bizarro help break up the monotony a tiny bit, but they don't count as progress toward completing the game, so there's little point in wasting time on them.     Being that Superman is mostly invincible, he doesn't have a health bar; however, the city of Metropolis does. The bad guys will torch trees, throw cars, and pummel civilians. Any damage to the city diminishes the health bar, and when it's empty, it's game over. This is a novel approach to indirectly making Superman vulnerable, but it also restricts the game's ""sandbox"" feel. Anytime you decide to smash something or set a car ablaze, you're just hurting yourself. Imagine a first-person shooter where you could shoot yourself in the head or a racing game where you could pour sugar in your own gas tank--that's kind of what it's like here. It sure might sound like fun to take the giant globe off of the Daily Planet and toss it into a group of cars, but the pesky thought of ""What would Superman do?"" and the negative effect your action will have on the city is always in the back of your mind. You can play as Bizarro and wreak some havoc, but causing trouble's just not that much fun when you're being forced to do it.     The combo-based fighting system lets you string together a fairly impressive number of moves, and after you complete a series of objectives, you'll earn new combos. Unfortunately, you don't really need many of these new moves, and you'll quickly find yourself either using the same combos over and over or just resorting to mashing buttons and hoping for the best. Superman also has his trusty heat vision, super breath, and of course his freeze breath, all of which can be powered up by finishing objectives. Some enemies are weak against a particular power, though a few are impervious to them, and there's even a creature that grows stronger should you try to use one of your powers on it. Freezing and burning enemies is actually pretty fun, but unless you like blowing enemies a half mile away and then chasing them down to pummel them, Superman's super breath is almost totally worthless--you only need use it a couple of times.         The combat sounds entertaining, and at first it is, but a number of problems quickly render it frustrating and uninteresting. Because you're fighting the same handful of enemies hundreds of times, the real challenge comes not from the enemies themselves, but from trying to stay interested in what's going on. The controls aren't overly complex, but it's still tough to get them to respond. Using the D pad to toggle between powers on the fly is frustrating, and it's tough to aim your attacks, too. You can lock on to enemies, but short of removing the target lock adjusting your position and hoping to lock on to another enemy, there's no way to change your focus during a battle. This is particularly problematic when you're in the air and getting attacked by a dragon that's just offscreen, or when you're fighting in a crowd, trying to punch a robot but wailing on an innocent civilian instead. Collision detection is dreadful, so sometimes you'll be hitting a bad guy (or getting hit by one) even though no punches are actually landing. For some unknown reason Superman can't jump. It's a pain to land, and Superman's inability to jump makes it tough to easily get to any enemy that's on top of a car or standing on the other side of a bush. When Superman can't get around a bit of shrubbery, you know things aren't going too well. An awful camera doesn't help matters much, either.      Despite the game's declaration that the camera is smart (it says so in the game options), it does a terrible job of following the action. You're frequently obscured by enemies, cars, and buildings. If you can see yourself, then chances are pretty good that you won't be able to find whatever you're fighting. Enemy icons will appear on one side of a building when the actual enemy is on the other side, and sometimes the camera gets so low to the ground that you can't see your target through all the traffic and pedestrians on the screen. A handy radar system helps alleviate this problem somewhat, but it's still a problem. Racing against Mister Mxyzptlk wasn't all that fun to start with, but it's also hindered by the camera, which works just fine for cruising the skies looking for trouble, but is considerably less friendly when moving at high speeds.      And then there are the boss battles, which are so bad they deserve special mention. If you were excited by the game's trailer, in which Superman took on a giant version of Metallo, you're in for a disappointment. Sure, you still get to fight him, but it's considerably less interesting than in the trailer. But that's not the real problem. The lengthy fight ends with Superman having to divert a missile--but the game never tells you how. After chasing it and getting close, you can shoot your heat vision at it, but that doesn't work, so it explodes, and then you get to do the entire fight again. Let's say on the next attempt you try to fly past the missile and hope that it locks on. Nope, you're dead. Try again. It turns out that all you have to do is get right next to it, which triggers a cutscene. Who knew that all you had to do to stop a missile was trigger a cutscene? Another boss fight sees you trying to save three blimps, that apparently are filled with hydrogen and highly explosive, from a group of flying dragons. After trying and failing to save each blimp, it turns out that you just need to save one, and the sequence suddenly ends for no discernable reason. Last but not least, you get to take on tornados. Yes, you'll be fighting tornados. You've got to blow them out over the water, freeze them, and put out fires caused by lighting. That's not so bad, but the game also implores you to save three injured citizens during all this madness. After wasting your time rescuing the injured, your reward is...nothing. You'll find that you can skip that part entirely. If you're not insane yet, the next sequence should do it for you. You're suddenly inside the tornado and you've got to ""stabilize the atmosphere"" by alternately shooting your heat and freeze breath while being sure to dodge all the garbage flying around inside. Once again, if you fail you have to do the entire tornado sequence over again. Only something like this could have you longing for the realistic scenarios from the movie Twister.        There's little reason to see the game through to its conclusion, much less ever play it again if you manage to finish it once. At least you can get some points out of the whole dreadful experience if you're playing the 360 version. Points are awarded for beating noteworthy bosses, and you can earn a couple of hundred points during the normal course of play. A few achievements, such as flying 10,000 miles or playing for 12 hours, will only be earned by those with a high tolerance for pain. To add insult to injury, the game tells you that you're 25 percent complete in less than an hour, but it ends up going on for a solid 10 mind-numbing hours.     Superman Returns isn't a particularly good-looking game, especially on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Sure, it's impressive to see such a large city on the older systems, but so much detail had to be sacrificed to make it happen that you've got to wonder if it was worth it. The city's slightly smaller, there's very little variety to the buildings, and each structure looks hideous up close. The Xbox 360 version looks quite a bit nicer, but along with the larger city and the more varied and detailed buildings come technical problems. Everything looks cool from high above the city, but as you zoom downward the texture pop-in and the drawn-in are very noticeable and distracting. The frame rate also regularly stutters and stammers. Even the FMV cutscenes are choppy.      All versions of the game have plain, ugly citizens, boring-looking cars, and a lack of destructible objects. You can randomly break up the bricks and glass on a few buildings (with damage effects that look too similar), and you can smash up cars and grab light poles, but not much else. The fire effects look pretty good, but when things like cars explode, you'll actually see them disappear for a second while the damaged model loads. One thing that won't disappear, at least some of the time, is the onscreen text that shows you what you're supposed to be doing. You'll be racing against the clock, and the whole time, ""GO!"" is emblazoned across the screen.         The best thing the game has going for it is the excellent orchestrated soundtrack that plays in the background. It doesn't sound like the movie's score, but it's still quite good, and given the quality of the rest of the game's audio, it should have been more prominently featured. Kevin Spacey, Brandon Routh, and Kate Bosworth all reprise their roles from the film, but their participation in the game is so minimal that you hardly even notice. Routh's performance is hampered by a horrendous script that has him admonishing his enemies with cheesy one-liners as he fights them--his dialogue during the Bizarro encounters is downright embarrassing. The rest of the sound effects sound OK, but they're repeated ad nauseam.     It's hard to shake the feeling that EA viewed the movie's DVD release as the last chance to capitalize on the movie license and was going to ship this game finished or unfinished, good or bad. It looks as though they finally settled on unfinished and bad. Superman Returns doesn't have much to do with the movie of the same name; the plot is a bunch of nonsense; and the game just doesn't capture the essence of what has made Superman such an enduring icon. If you're an Xbox 360 owner who has played the Superman Returns demo, you've already played the best part of this game. It's fun to fly above the city and then zoom down at the speed of sound to zigzag among the buildings, and it's even fun to pound on robots for a short time. But the fun quickly ends courtesy of the bland graphics, lousy controls, boring combat, and repetitive objectives.     "
3988,Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,5.0,1," The Dinotopia franchise has been around for a number of years now. Originating as a series of books, Dinotopia has also been turned into a miniseries, a short-lived TV series, and a game--last year's Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates for the GBA. If you've never encountered Dinotopia before, it chronicles the story of a hidden island where humans and dinosaurs have been living together in harmony. The latest addition to the series is Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey, an action adventure game from TDK Mediactive that, for better or worse, tries very hard to capture the atmosphere and style of the Dinotopia books, but for the most part, it just isn't a lot of fun to play.       Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey follows the story of Drake Gemini, his twin brother, Jacob, and their father, who have been stranded on Dinotopia for 10 years. At the beginning of the game, Drake and Jacob's father is attacked and killed by a rogue Tyrannosaurus while exploring the outer jungles of Dinotopia. After the killing, Drake and Jacob begin to go their separate ways, with Jacob joining a gang of dinosaur-hating humans called the Outsiders and Drake choosing to take on the role of a guardian of Dinotopia. In the game, you play as Drake, and your task is to defend Dinotopia from a bevy of underwhelming threats.   Right out of the gate, Dinotopia lets you know that it doesn't have much intention of messing around with any sort of interesting plot or mission structure. The first task you're assigned is to go get trained in combat by a weird old man who feels that he has to train you in order to keep you from falling off the deep end after your father's death, or something like that. After you've mastered the basic combat skills, you'll be sent to one of Dinotopia's sages (there are three sages in all, and they're rather difficult to keep track of) so that you might learn more skills from her. From here on out, the game turns into one gigantic fetch quest. You'll be charged with such tasks as running through a swamp to find a hermit, so he can tell you to go find an item, but you'll discover that before you can get that item, you'll have to go get something else to bring back to another person so that person can give you what you need to go get the first item. Every mission is pretty much a variation on having to go get something and bring it back to someone else, and it wears thin extremely fast.    To top off the painfully dull mission structure, you'll also be treated to a seemingly endless cavalcade of long-drawn-out cutscenes that just don't go anywhere. Apparently, no character in Dinotopia can explain anything without droning on and on about unnecessary details that simply have no relevance to the mission you're about to embark on, and there's a fair amount of needless pontificating about improving your mind, body, soul, and whatever other nonsense the game feels like throwing at you. It would be one thing if this sort of pontification were done well and made relevant to what you were doing in the game, but in Dinotopia, it simply feels completely out of place and totally irrelevant.   Amid all the pointless running around and existential musings, you will, thankfully, find yourself engaging in a fair amount of combat in Dinotopia. Drake's weapon of choice is a large mallet, with upgradable mallet heads that can do progressively heavier damage as the game goes on. You'll have two attacks at your disposal--one is your basic attack, and the other is an uppercut-like jump attack that you perform with the jump button when you have an enemy targeted with the L trigger. There is also a magic button that performs a special attack when your magic meter is filled up to the necessary level. Magic attacks are unique to each type of mallet head and can range from simple invincibility functionality to a sweeping stun attack that knocks down every enemy within range. Projectile attacks can also be accessed using the right and left buttons of the D pad. Occasionally you'll get to break up the standard combat by traveling around in a strutter--a robotlike apparatus that walks around like a dinosaur and attacks like one as well--but for the most part, it's hand-to-hand combat in Dinotopia.   The combat system is probably the most developed aspect of the game, but it still falls short of being interesting, thanks primarily to the extremely unintelligent and useless enemies. Most bad guys in the game tend to run at you in packs, and the one you happen to be targeting will attack frequently, while the rest just stand around, periodically trying to hit you, though rarely ever doing a very good job of it. Once you've upgraded your mallet to a decent level, practically every enemy in the game--human and dinosaur alike--can be done away with fairly easily. There are a few difficult bad guys here and there, but they're pretty few and far between.       Though Dinotopia's gameplay is entirely lackluster, the game's graphics actually aren't bad at all. All of the environments contained within Dinotopia, though fairly low in polygon count, are quite nice to look at, with some unique and aesthetically pleasing design elements. Every character in the game looks reasonably solid, though not great by any means. This is most apparent in cutscenes, where characters don't move their mouths at all while talking and move around in a pretty jerky fashion. The dinosaur characters definitely look a lot better than the humans, but both have their distinct flaws. Technically, the game does run very smoothly, and frame rate drops or graphical glitches are nowhere to be found.   The game's sound, however, is on the other side of the fence--especially in the area of voice acting. Every character in the game sounds like he or she was voiced by some two-bit actor the developers yanked out of a dinner-theater production of Hamlet, complete with cheesy British and Scottish accents. Drake's and Jacob's voices are probably the most offensive--they sound like a bad mixture of Scrooge McDuck and Darrell Hammond's Saturday Night Live impersonation of Sean Connery. Aside from the atrocious voice acting, most of the in-game effects are pretty sparse at best, with a lot of repeated thud, smack, and crash effects that seem more silly than anything else. Most of the music in the game is of the Renaissance Faire ilk, with lots of flutes and acoustic guitars. It's actually probably the best aspect of Dinotopia's audio presentation, but it's still not all that great. Dinotopia does support Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound, but it doesn't use the support particularly well.   Dinotopia is, more than anything else, just a poorly designed game. While it may have some reasonably pleasing visuals, the tedious nature of the story and gameplay, coupled with the cringingly bad sound, simply makes the game an unpleasant experience in general. Only the most die-hard of Dinotopia fans will find anything to like about The Sunstone Odyssey, and all others should definitely look elsewhere for their action adventure game needs.   "
717,Tom Clancy's The Division 2,9.0,2,"I don't know why I'm in Washington DC; some lady just told me to be here. But there are civilians in distress, armed gangs roaming the streets, and me, my pals, and the second amendment are apparently the only ones who can actually do anything about it. I have no idea what, if anything, is going on with the seemingly important people I meet. But so long as I'm helping folks, sending (presumably) bad people to bed, walking the pretty streets, and picking up a new pair of gloves every so often, I'm very happy to hang around.In the world of Tom Clancy's The Division 2, the USA has been ravaged by a virus and society has crumbled. While those who remain try to survive by banding together in groups of various dispositions, the Strategic Homeland Division activates highly specialized sleeper agents to try and restore order. It's a setting ripe in potential, perhaps to tell a ripping techno-thriller story that scrutinizes the structures of our modern society and government, or perhaps to make a video game that leverages the chaos that occurs when multiple idealistic groups clash in a vie for power in a lawless city. The Division 2 only does one of these things.It's not the story. Throughout the entirety of The Division 2's main campaign, never did the game spend a satisfactory amount of time on any semblance of an overarching plot, or the predicaments of its supposedly important figures. There are no character arcs, only abrupt setups and consequences. Narrative devices, like audio logs found in the world, add little of consequence. Even the game's biggest macguffins--the President of the United States and his briefcase containing a cure for the virus--have a minimal amount of absolutely forgettable screen time. The opportunity to use The Division 2 to create meaningful fiction is wasted.Instead, The Division 2 focuses its narrative chops into worldbuilding. The city, a ravaged Washington DC, initially feels a little homogenous in the way most Western cities do. But after some time, the personality of the different districts--the buildings, the landmarks, the natural spaces, and the ways they've been repurposed or affected by the cataclysm--begins to shine through. It's this strength of environment which lays a very strong foundation for The Division 2 as a video game, creating an engrossing, believable, and contiguous open world.Moving from your safehouse to the open world and your next mission area is almost entirely seamless. It's something that was also true of the original Division, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the simple act of going from place to place in The Division 2 is one of the game's more rewarding aspects. One road may lead to a skirmish with a rival patrol or an optional activity, another might simply give you another stirring scene of urban decay in the morning sun. An obscured shortcut through an apartment block might turn up some useful items in an abandoned home, which you might decide to donate to the makeshift settlements where civilians have attempted to rebuild their lives.Visiting those settlements--initially as hovels, before they gradually grow and become more charming, vibrant places thanks to your efforts in the world--becomes a strong motivator early on in the absence of a plot to chase. Outside main missions, which are dedicated to the weakening of rival factions and achieving indiscriminate objectives, the game's ""Projects"" are one of the most lucrative means of earning experience to better your character. Projects ask you to donate resources you find out in the world and participate in side activities, encouraging you to spend more time in the world, see new areas, fight new battles, search for new equipment to use, and find enjoyment in that. The Division 2 is, after all, a game devoted to providing you with a continuous stream of gripping conflicts, valuable rewards, and a perpetual sense of progress and satisfaction from doing these things. It does those things very well.You spend a lot of time hunkered behind cover, popping out to fire at any enemy dumb enough to expose themselves. With the large amount of weapon variety available, this familiar facet of combat is solid in itself. Add to that the ability to equip two special skills from a possible eight--which include tools such as riot shields, drones, and from what I can gather, robot bees of some sort--and combat gets pretty interesting. But the vector that really keeps The Division 2's combat lively for upwards of 60 hours is the behaviour and diversity of its enemy types.That time you spend in cover? The Division 2 doesn't want you to just stay there. You can go down very quickly if you're out in the open, but the game has a dozen ways to always keep you taking those risks and finding better firing positions--aggressive melee units, remote control cars equipped with sawblades, even the regular assault units frequently attempt to outflank you. Those special abilities? You absolutely need to use them to their full potential to survive some encounters, whether by throwing out the seeker mines or the automated turret to keep enemies at bay while you focus on a priority target, or perhaps utilizing the chemical launcher to start a fire and create a zone of denial.The effort needed to take out an adversary is relatively reasonable for a shooter that prioritizes the RPG nature of its combat model, but some of the tougher enemies have additional, visible layers of protection which you need to focus on breaking if you want to land critical hits. On the flip side, some enemies have additional, obtuse weak points which can work to your advantage, but only if you can hit them. The fuel tank on the back of a flamethrower unit might be feasible, but when you start running into the terrifying robotic quadruped in post-campaign activities, whose tiny weak point only reveals itself seconds before it fires its devastating railgun, you have to assess whether you can afford to take on that challenge among all the other things pressuring you. The Division 2 throws a lot of hurdles at you, but also gives you the means to quickly counter and resolve them. Whether you can juggle that many balls at once is what keeps combat continually tense and exciting.What's also exciting is the treasure at the end of these gauntlets. The Washington locations, refashioned into memorable combat arenas, are often rewarding in their own right (a fight in a planetarium is an early standout). But improving your equipment is the vital, tangible part that keeps you feeling like you're making progress. You receive new gear in generous amounts, some dropped by an enemy or looted from a container found in the world, others rewarded for completing a mission, and the next dose always feels in reach. The weapon variety forces you to consider something completely different to take advantage of a power boost, and the armor variety provides an impressive number of different cosmetic looks. The Division 2 incorporates a microtransaction and loot box system for its inconsequential clothing options, though these can be found in the world and earned of your own accord, too.Like combat, gear remains intriguing throughout The Division 2 not just because of the abstract desire to have bigger numbers attached to your person and progress further through the game's challenges, but also through a raft of ""talents."" These add unique perks that complement particular skills or styles of play, like providing bonuses within a certain range or when enemies are burning or your armor is depleted. The brands of armor also have a part to play, whereby equipping a number of pieces from a single manufacturer provide additional advantages. These bonuses become particularly attractive to obsess over in the endgame, when the world is retaken by a tougher, more merciless enemy faction called Black Tusk, and you need to ensure your ability to fight them is the best it can be.For the hundreds of pieces you will inevitably want to discard, the ability to sell or dismantle them for parts to either purchase or craft pieces you want gives value to everything you pick up. Or you might retain them in order to move their talents to better gear of the same type, And, as a wonderful convenience, The Division 2 implements numerous features to inspect, mark, dismantle, or equip things you find so quickly and elegantly--sometimes without ever having to enter a menu--that it improves the whole experience of being in its world.The same can be said of the game's multiplayer integration, which allows you to easily group up and progress with friends (the game will scale any underpowered players to match the most powerful). You can also start or join a clan, which opens up a variety of weekly challenges, granting valuable rewards, and features integrated game-wide group communication options. Even if you're only interested in playing alone (which is more challenging, but entirely feasible for everything but the most demanding of endgame activities), the ability to matchmake with other players at any time, whether that be in the open world, before you start a mission, or when you're at a final boss, is a very welcome and useful feature.And when you beat that final boss of the game's final mission (though, such is The Division 2's lack of plot framing, I honestly couldn't tell you his name to save my life) and you think you've finally run out of treasure to keep luring you through more fights, the metaphorical table gets flipped. Flipped hard. The Washington DC you spent so long liberating from rival factions becomes completely retaken by the aforementioned Black Tusk. You unlock three unique class specializations, each with their own skill trees to build out. Your focus on growing two-digit numbers on your character (your level) moves to three-digit numbers (the quality of your gear). The wealth of activities available to you once you complete the campaign is enormous, and it capitalizes on your momentum. It motivates you to continue seeing more, doing more, and growing more.More challenging, remixed versions of campaign missions and lengthier stronghold missions featuring Black Tusk become available. These ""Invaded"" missions often leverage the new enemy types to create terrifying new combat scenarios that maintain the steady ramp-up of challenge, and they give you a fantastic reason to revisit the memorable combat arenas with purpose. Open-world events become more dynamic and riskier--factions clash more frequently for control of territory, and your involvement in certain activities can dramatically increase the danger and rewards in others. Limited-time challenges, which take the form of new Projects, higher difficulty missions, and additional bounty targets found in the world, offer avenues for more lucrative bonuses. There are even more activities beyond that, and the strength of The Division 2's endgame is not just in the wealth of content available, but how viable it all is in improving your standing in the world.The journey to bolstering your Gear Score to qualify for higher tiers of challenges and content is always clear. The game continues to make sure you're always meaningfully rewarded no matter what you do, and that feeling of bettering your character persists throughout.It's remarkable how straightforward the game makes it for you to see the full breadth of its content and maintains that feeling of continual advancement all the way to the bitter end, especially in spite of its unsubstantial plots, characters, and narrative themes. Once I finally hit the game's current soft cap for progression, I was impressed by how much there still was to pursue.The world of The Division 2 also features three separate Dark Zone areas, systematically accessible throughout the campaign, which promise the possibility of high-quality equipment but pose more risks beyond the regular open-world. The power dynamic between you and enemies are normalized, and there's the uncertain element of having other players to interact with. In the Dark Zone, players can choose to cooperate with others in the world to clear out enemy outposts and explore the regions for equipment, but the option to go 'Rogue' and undermine the work of other players provides the opportunity for greater rewards at the risk of greater losses if you fail to get away with it. Exploring the Dark Zone is a fascinating aspect of The Division 2 that adds additional facets of tension, distrust, and dishonesty to a game that already features high-stakes combat. Moreover, it is a completely optional pathway to reaching the game's highest tiers of achievement. The game's similarly optional Conflict activities offer gear incentives for participating in traditional team-based multiplayer modes, which felt serviceable in the few matches I played, but were comparatively underpopulated compared to other avenues of matchmaking at the time of writing.The setting of The Division 2 is ripe for potential, and it's a shame the game doesn't use it to say anything. I have absolutely no clue why I'm here, what anyone's motivations are, and I wish I had a strong narrative driver to fuel a purpose behind my endless hunger for progression. This letdown is hard to ignore for the game's initial hours, but the strength of the systems and design that fuel The Division 2 as a game are compelling enough to keep you captivated for dozens more. The range of enemy types continues to keep combat encounters challenging, the equipment I earn and pick up continues to feel different, valuable, and asks me to consider new ways of play. The ravaged environments continue to intrigue, and sometimes they're so stunning I find myself needing to take screenshots before I move on. It might not have much to say, but The Division 2 is a perpetual cycle of tension, relief, and reward that's difficult to stay away from."
2004,Betrayer,7.0,2,"The chilling cry of a spirit told me to move off the trail and head into the woods, wherein lay the next clue in my investigation. What would I find this time? Perhaps the remains of a skeleton, weathered by the elements, its bones shattered by some malicious deed. Or would it be broken arrow shafts, left behind after an intense and bloody battle? In my eagerness, I made a grave error. My sudden movements were careless, as confirmed by the arrow whistling through the air. It struck its mark, and I attempted to limp to the safety of the forest. A coarse bellow drowned out the sound of my footsteps. Bursting through the brush charged a creature in the shape of a Spanish conquistador, its armor accented by red, from the belt, to the undershirt, to the burning eyes. It looked like the spirit would have to be patient for just a little while longer. The flash of a blade caused my screen to erupt in crimson.     Souls series. Loot, the game's currency, is found in destructible boxes or picked up off the corpses of defeated enemies. Taking damage is inevitable, and healing requires taking a swig from a water flask, which has a limited number of uses before depletion. You must refill it at a water barrel located in specific locations, such as forts, if you desire to live long in the wilds. Dying in battle warps you back to the last base you discovered, forcing you to drop your loot in the place you fell. If you don't recover your lost loot before you die again, it's gone forever. And much like From Software's role-playing game epics, Betrayer does not offer a clear-cut path to your destination. The world is open to explore, and within it are hidden treasures, as well as clues that offer a window into the lives of the settlers who once populated the colony. Like a fever dream, the environment is stripped of color, save for red, and in the distance, trees and structures melt into the intense white light. Clues often take the form of red-bordered scraps of paper, and written on them are the thoughts, hopes, and darkest fears of the missing populace. You get an understanding of the anxiety of those who lived in English settlements, as they withstood attacks by soldiers and natives. There are talks of shaky truces and broken family ties, whispers of a deadly blight, and rumors of shadowy figures stalking farmland and leaving dead crops behind. The scraps fill the missing pieces of the overall puzzle, but leave enough empty spaces for you to inject your own theories on how the people ultimately met their fate. The colorless land first introduced is merely the surface of a deeper world. Each area includes an ominous bell that, when rung, transports you to another plane of existence: the Otherworld, where angry spirits take the form of skeletons with bright red eyes, or shadowy demons crowned with silver skulls and armed with long talons. Also wandering throughout this tainted land are wraiths, the lost spirits of those who died in the living world, unable to cross over due to anger or guilt. It is here in the Otherworld that the game becomes truly unnerving. The developer is made up of members from Monolith, creator of the F.E.A.R. series, and the influence is apparent. Betrayer is steeped in tense, edge-of-your-seat moments for which Monolith was known. The game's soundtrack is the wind that whips through the environment, the guttural growls of enemies, and the pounding of your heart as you desperately line up your shot before being overtaken. But in the Otherworld, the oppressive atmosphere is on a whole new level. The overwhelming darkness is nearly suffocating, and the ghastly cries of wraiths from deep inside the impenetrable black shroud chilled me to the core. With the undead demons that haunt the black forest and the cursed wooden totems that burst through the ground with a shrill scream, the Otherworld is a frightening and harsh environment. Your role in Betrayer is not unlike that of a paranormal investigator, except with results. In the living world, you examine scenes of violence, looking upon pools of congealed blood and digging up buried objects, such as corroded pendants and ruined scabbards. You bring evidence to wraiths in the Otherworld, who slowly begin to remember their past lives, as well as the atrocities they committed which led to their imprisonment. The truth of what occurred in the colony is slowly unraveled through your detective work, with many early mysteries taking time to solve. What robbed the land of life? What are the ash figures that populate some of the forts? And who is the enigmatic maiden in red, to whom you must report the results of your investigations? Betrayer is split up into several large destinations, each including points of interest, such as hidden cabins or villages. Discovered locations act as waypoints and can be fast traveled to at any moment when you are out of combat. Every area contains a fort, or at least some sort of base of operations, where you can fill your waterskin and exchange loot for new weapons, ammunition, and charms. The charms add status boosts, such as decreased reloading time or increased health, but the amount is diminutive. For example, a crude charm of swiftness increases your speed by a meager four percent and costs 300 loot. The next tier up boosts that to six percent, and costs twice as much. The difference between the charms is negligible to the point where it's doubtful you would even notice a change. I ended up not purchasing any charms, keeping only the ones handed freely at the start of my quest and replacing them with more powerful versions found in various hidden chests scattered throughout the game. The artificial intelligence powering enemies is unpredictable, straddling the line between aggression and ambivalence. In many adventure games, alerted enemies give chase for only so long before returning to their post. The same could be said for the foes in Betrayer, but how far they will give chase is not abundantly clear. At times, you can run far enough and hide, forcing enemies to give up. Other foes in Betrayer are exceedingly aggressive, however, and pursue you to the end of the map, regardless of the steps you take to keep them off the scent. This issue quickly leads to frustration, especially considering that many enemies can match your running pace. It often takes too long to turn, aim, and fire, so in these moments, your choices dwindle to either running all the way to a water barrel and fighting near your source of health, or accepting the loss and hoping you make it back to your loot unscathed. Enemy variety is unfortunately sparse in Betrayer, and even as you near the end of your 10-hour quest, the same foes still bar your path. During this time, however, I wasn't the same adventurer I was when my enemies and I first clashed. My weapons were far more powerful, fully capable of picking off adversaries with a single shot, abolishing the need to move with caution. The game also begins to get repetitive. The method in which you complete investigations doesn't evolve beyond finding evidence, speaking to a wraith, and repeating these steps until you clear the area. These issues combined caused some dull late-game moments, where I moved through locations unchallenged by monotonous puzzles. Betrayer allows you to change its stark monochrome aesthetics by adjusting a set of sliders to tweak color levels to those of typical adventure games. But doing so removes the game's air of mystery, and it is the mysteries that make Betrayer such a compelling experience. A lot of riddles are solved by the end of the game, yet even as the final curtain falls, many more questions are left unanswered. Nevertheless, with such questions still lingering, the macabre, eerie world of Betrayer is worth the time spent. Spirits of the damned cry out for your help, and you should heed their calls."
4508,Jaws Unleashed,4.0,0,"  Displayed on the various loading screens of Jaws Unleashed are a number of trivia bits pertaining to the original Jaws film. One particularly excellent piece of trivia cites that the writer of both the Jaws novel and screenplay, Peter Benchley, never would have written the original story had he known anything about realistic shark behaviors. But while history has been kind to Jaws' legacy, in spite of its creative liberties, Jaws Unleashed, the action game based on the film license and developed by Appaloosa International, won't be getting any such pass. And Appaloosa doesn't get to excuse its awful game by claiming not to know anything about making a fun action adventure starring an ocean-based lead character, either. This is the maker of the Ecco the Dolphin games, otherwise known as some of the best underwater adventures ever put on consoles. Jaws Unleashed is, in every imaginable way, the anti-Ecco. Instead of saving humanity, you're chomping down on it with sharp, angry teeth, and instead of finding yourself having a breezy, enjoyable time with the game, you'll find yourself cursing at Jaws Unleashed's awful controls, even worse camera, and completely idiotic missions.        Jaws Unleashed takes place 30 years after the events of the first film. The days of the malcontent shark have all but been forgotten, and Amity Island has returned to its days as a thriving township. But when a major corporation comes to town to do something entirely corporate and anonymously evil, the local marine population is disturbed, and along comes yet another gigantic shark (or is it the same one, 30 years later?) to lay waste to the populace and wreak havoc on the island. The setup for the shark-biting action is flimsy at best; but then again, this isn't really a game you'd ever play for its story, and the developers had to find some way to tie the Jaws license into this whole thing.     You can't really blame the Jaws license for sinking this game. This is not some hastily tossed-together cash-in on a classic movie. This game was originally announced back in 2003 as Sole Predator, and was a completely license-free shark-based action game long before the Jaws license came along. So without the license to blame, all you're left with is an entirely poor game design. In theory, it's not a bad idea for a game. Jaws Unleashed takes the concept of an open-ended game world and simply makes it an underwater adventure. It also takes the sort of freeform ultraviolence of something like the Grand Theft Auto series, replacing guns with rows and rows of sharp teeth. Once you get past the first mission, you can go just about anywhere on Amity Island and eat just about anyone or anything you want, be they people, dolphins, seals, or anything else with an ounce of blood in it. Not to mention that you can destroy various pieces of the scenery and take part in some side missions. While that might sound like a hoot, every other aspect of the game design conspires to wreck the experience.     For starters, the game controls are just awful. Jaws starts out with a few basic moves, including a basic bite, a charge-up head-butt attack that's good for wrecking boats, docks, and the like, and a slightly less damaging but still reasonably effective tail whip. You can earn new moves over time, too. But the problem with the basic moveset given to Jaws is that the shark just doesn't handle well. It's not necessarily surprising that a big, lumbering shark, traveling at full speed through the water, might blow past a target or have trouble lining itself up for a precise attack, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating in this game, when so many of your mission objectives and attacks require a degree of precision that simply isn't there.     Not to mention that some of the things Jaws can do are just ridiculous. One of the things you'll actually find yourself doing a lot in the game is having Jaws jump out of the water and onto dry land to grab some poor, unsuspecting schmuck. And it isn't like Jaws just throws his head out long enough to grab the guy and sink back into the water--Jaws actually beaches himself in most cases, and you use the swim button to make him wriggle his way back ever so slowly into the water. He can survive for only a limited number of seconds, but watching this unbelievably silly act is no less mind-blowing to watch--nor any less frustrating when he gets stuck on some invisible piece of scenery and can't make it back to the water in time.     The in-game camera makes matters even worse. Enemies come from all directions in Jaws Unleashed, and trying to position the camera in such a way as to make it so you're not constantly getting nailed from behind is a near impossibility. It's even worse because the game constantly forces you to feed on enemies to maintain your hunger level (if it drops too low, you die), but when you're getting constantly sideswiped by enemies you can't see, and you can't properly steer yourself into an opportune position to snag a meal fast enough, you're going to find yourself extremely flustered. It's even worse when you're swimming near surface level. The camera snaps beneath and above the water depending on where you're at, and if you get too close to the surface while trying to snag something or perform an attack, the camera will snap to the surface view, which totally obscures your ability to see if you hit what you were after, and to even get the camera back to a normal position, you have to swim down a ways.     You might be willing to struggle with the controls if the game provided missions that were entertaining in the slightest. Jaws Unleashed does nothing of the sort. For what it's worth, there is a measure of entertainment to be found in Jaws' missions, but it's purely unintentional hilarity. Take, for example, the very first mission objective you're handed. You're trapped in a science lab, and in order to escape, a door must be opened. Normal Jaws logic would dictate that simple brute force would get you out, but no, not in Jaws Unleashed. Here, you have to grab a nearby scientist, drag him into the water, swim over to a nearby key card reader, swipe his body past it, and thus, open the door.     And this is hardly the only example--the game is littered with scenarios in which you're picking up exploding barrels with your mouth to toss at enemies (inexplicably, the barrels catch on fire the moment they leave your jaws), and murdering orca whales inside theme parks so that a magic door will open instantly the second that orca dies. Maybe it's asking for too much to expect a total reenvisioning of the action game paradigm in a budget, movie-licensed game, but Appaloosa failed to think anywhere even resembling outside the box on this one, instead slavishly dedicating itself to recycling the same trite, boilerplate action-game mission designs that have been done to death in other games and furthermore, seem ludicrously out of place in a game starring a wild shark. It's not even done with a hint of irony or humor.        Jaws Unleashed's presentational aspects are better produced than anything the gameplay has to offer, but that isn't to suggest they're any good. Expectedly, the most graphical detail is shown in the Jaws model, and it is a pretty good-looking shark by any standard. It animates well, looks natural swimming, and basically does what it needs to in order to look like a big, mean shark. The underwater environments have their charm, too. You'll see lots of little schools of fish, groupings of dolphins, and other assorted undersea bric-a-brac swimming about--although you won't see any of it until it's practically right in front of you, as the game has a terrible draw distance. Once you get out of the water, things fall apart. The people in the game just look bad, and the environmental designs above water just look cheap. There are also plenty of random animation glitches and random bugs to give the game something of an unfinished feel. It also crashed to the desktop on us a couple of times while playing. The PC version of Jaws does at least sport a better frame rate than either of the console versions. But the graphics still look pretty bland, even with the resolution cranked all the way up. This is also very clearly a console port, and only the bare minimum has been done to make it function on the PC. Menus don't even include mouse support. On the audio front, there's some decent orchestral music going on in the background, but beyond that, it's just cheesy voice acting and some underwhelming sound effects and screams. And even the musical score isn't that great, especially considering the theme music the game uses isn't the original track from the movie, but rather a new orchestration of it that sounds a little cheesier. The PC version also seems to have a few weird audio bugs. The screams of random passersby tend to repeat more often. Sometimes the pitch of the characters' voices also goes weirdly high and at random intervals.     There's certainly a measure of morbid thrill that can be derived from some of the more open-ended components of Jaws Unleashed. A novel level of enjoyment exists in the notion of swimming up to an unsuspecting oceangoer and sinking your teeth into them, dragging them screaming beneath the waves and turning them into a midday snack. However, the novelty of said action wears off about 15 minutes into Jaws Unleashed, and without it, all you're left with is a really lousy action game that's cumbersome to play, contains not a single interesting mission over the course of its roughly 10-hour structure, and looks and sounds terribly mediocre. The $20 price tag might seem enticing, but $20 for a bad game is no deal at all.    "
722,Hypnospace Outlaw,8.0,2,"Log on to Hypnospace and you find yourself jolted back to the late '90s internet age where every page belonged to a webring, had a visitor counter, and blared tinny MIDI music on loop every 15 seconds. The Hypnospace web portal is a walled garden, to use the modern term, split into themed zones that play host to whatever it is people make websites about. Or rather, what people used to make websites about.It's 1999, the frontier era of the internet, before it was dominated by corporations, where random people stole some HTML and threw up a page dedicated to whatever random things interested them at the time. There's a kind of ramshackle energy at play--whether it's in Bill Aldrin's House of Sound and his raw music reviews or Gus' Temple of Serenity and his earnest new age-isms--that will make those of a certain generation (i.e. me) nostalgic for the looser, weirder, more experimental, yet more innocent internet that we seem to have lost in the years since.You navigate these sites as a kind of moderator in the employ of Merchantsoft, the startup behind Hypnospace. You're dispatched jobs to track down incidents of content infringement, harassment, illegal activity, and so on, removing the offending text, images, or links from the pages you find them, and issuing warnings to the users who posted them.Initially, you're assigned specific zones to monitor, and early cases are a simple matter of browsing the pages in each zone until you encounter the relevant material. The pages themselves are mostly spot on in terms of their portrayal of late '90s amateur internet culture and reading through each new page becomes a source of constant amusement. What you're being asked to do as a mod in these early cases isn't especially interesting, but that's fine, because the writing across the board is so sharp.Things soon get more complicated, and fulfilling each new task requested by your manager becomes more of a puzzle that you really need to work to solve. These puzzles are mostly satisfying to work through. You'll be plugging in search terms to track down potential leads, cross-referencing data and Hypnospace user IDs, reading blog entries to identify clues that might suggest how you could try to crack someone's password, exploring unlisted zones and installing new kinds of software. It quickly becomes a game of internet detective where you're saving documents to your virtual desktop and bookmarking pages of interest to return to later.Where it suffers is when this sleuthing distracts from the writing. Getting stuck and browsing through the same pages again and again rarely makes any of the jokes funnier. As you progress through the cases, weeks and months pass and you'll see the passage of time reflected as users update their pages--occasionally even in response to your moderating actions--while new pages appear and old ones close. Such updates are welcome, and remarkable given the sheer quantity of pages you're able to browse by the game's end, but you're still going to be looking at the same stuff many times over before you're done.Hypnospace Outlaw loves the internet, warts and all. It loves how the internet is really still all about weird online communities and their rivalries, feuds, and splinter groups, and how one person's ideas--both good and bad--can gather momentum and spin out of control. It also loves how trivial much of the internet really is, and how we should both celebrate all this made-up nonsense and acknowledge how much of our time with the internet is just frittered away on garbage. It also very accurately simulates that ""down the rabbit hole"" journey where one click leads to another, and before you realize it, you've spent the night chasing links and can't remember whatever it was that prompted the expedition in the first place.There are glimpses of darkness through the nostalgic haze, and it's in these moments that you realize that this isn't really just about the internet of the '90s. The cowboy arrogance and shady dealings of Merchantsoft is analogous to many tech startups of today that promise to liberate but only oppress. And in a frightening near-future vision of the gig economy, you're paid in Hypnocoin, a virtual currency accepted at Hypnospace's commercial partners, and only receive payments for reporting violations of Hypnospace's code of conduct. These elements may feel ahead of their time for a game set in 1999, but they make a fair point about where we've taken the internet in the intervening years.As an exploration of early-ish internet culture, Hypnospace Outlaw demonstrates how far we've travelled online over the past 20 years while at the same time asking whether we've gone anywhere at all. The bandwidth may have improved since 1999 but the content can look all too familiar today."
4115,Space Channel 5: Ulala's Cosmic Attack,4.0,0," You'd never guess that a company could transform Simon--the electronic game where you recall patterns of color--into a stylish and entertaining dance contest, but that's exactly what Sega did with Space Channel 5. Originally released for the Dreamcast and now available for the Game Boy Advance courtesy of THQ, Space Channel 5 puts you into the shoes of Ulala, a leggy reporter assigned to observe an alien invasion that's occurring aboard a space station. Rather quickly, Ulala joins in the fight against the aliens, but not with guns or bombs as you'd expect. Instead, Ulala's weapon is the ability to mimic the dancing moves of the invaders, which allows her to free their human slaves and incapacitate their leaders. As you can imagine, something was lost in the conversion of these dance numbers from 3D graphics on the Dreamcast to 2D graphics on the Game Boy Advance, but the real problem with the conversion is that the timing of the dance moves is much less forgiving on the handheld.      The gist of the game involves Ulala walking from level to level and copying the dance routines performed by the aliens. If an alien says, ""Up, right, right, down, shoot, shoot,"" then you'll need to perform the same moves with the exact same timing during the next portion of the song. Every time you succeed, the humans you free will join your dance posse and follow you around until the end of a level, where you'll eventually square off against a large boss monster--copying its dance moves to defeat it, just like you did with the smaller aliens. The game evaluates your progress based on the percentage of moves you perform correctly, which determines whether or not you'll advance to the next level.   As simple as the concept sounds, Space Channel 5 worked well on the Dreamcast because it presented the story like a futuristic Broadway musical. Copying the aliens' moves required precise timing, but the reward was a series of lengthy dance numbers that flexed the visual and audio muscles of the system. As previously mentioned, the GBA version has been scaled back quite a bit, but it still looks decent. The game's main problem stems from having to accurately time your dance moves. Even if you input each move correctly, you'll blow the entire section if you begin too late or pause just a split-second longer than you're supposed to. The original Dreamcast game was challenging, but it at least allowed enough leeway that you never felt you were being scored for failures when you were performing the proper commands. The GBA version seems unfair in this regard, and it's less enjoyable as a result.      It's a shame that more time wasn't spent tidying up the controls, because THQ has managed to capture the futuristic look and feel of the original Dreamcast game relatively well. All of the formerly polygon-based backgrounds are duplicated using two-dimensional renders and various camera angles. Ulala and the other dancers are brought to life using traditional sprite animation, and the variety of moves and reactions is pretty decent except for a few instances of stiffness here and there. Dance routines aren't nearly as impressive as they were on the Dreamcast, mainly due to the loss of the various laser and smoke effects that went along with each scene, but the developers did succeed in incorporating the constantly growing entourage that Ulala acquires as she releases more hostages within each level. Text boxes have replaced the majority of the digitized speech that was in the Dreamcast version of the game, although there are still some vocal snippets that pop up from time to time. Most of the music has been copied intact as well.   Like the original Dreamcast game, Space Channel 5 on the Game Boy Advance is a brief experience. In all, there are only four unique levels. Once you complete the game, you can unlock an extra mode that changes some of the sections within each level--but not to the extent that any level feels significantly different from its original configuration.   Ultimately, the frustrating controls ruin what could have otherwise been a standout conversion of one of the Dreamcast's more unique games. Any chance to enjoy the action occurring onscreen is swept away by the inability to get a fair shake from the computer.  "
2668,Skullgirls: Encore,8.0,2,"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3--with a little less overwhelming insanity. Skullgirls saves its spectacle for the characters, while keeping its combat fast and focused.        Skullgirls lets you bring one to three characters to a fight, even if your opponent chooses a different combination. These different combinations provide interesting variability to how the game plays. A single character can deal and withstand more damage than those of a two- or three-person team; however, that single character loses the ability to call for assist attacks, to link hyper combos, or to recover lost health while tagged out. This creates a natural balance to keep one combination from having an overwhelming advantage over the other two.     Adjustable team sizes naturally scale the complexity as well. Having more characters on a team means more variables to internalize during a fight. A lone, superpowered fighter is easier to manage than three average-strength ones. This trade-off between raw strength and versatility helps accommodate a wider skill range. This isn't to say that Skullgirls lacks depth. Each character feels wildly distinct from the rest. Even the two projectile-focused fighters--Peacock and Parasol--handle differently. Peacock fills the screen with fast-moving projectiles, while Parasol uses timed explosives and long-range pokes. With only eight characters, Skullgirls' roster may not be as large as other fighters--but its combatants are nicely varied.     The underlying fighting system is equally rich, with several smart and simple alternatives for typical fighting game annoyances such as high/low unblockables and infinite loops. An unblockable refers to a combination of simultaneous attacks that are impossible to guard against. These are accepted in some tag fighters, but Skullgirls automatically protects you if you block part of an unblockable combination. Infinite loops are just what they sound like: attack strings that can be repeated indefinitely. Most fighters patch these out on a case-by-case basis, but Skullgirls just says ""no"" with its Infinity Breaker. This quick, invulnerable attack is available only when an infinite is detected, it deals no damage, and it knocks the opponent away.     These and other design choices let the game be a little more flexible with what tools it gives you. Assist attacks are a great example. In Skullgirls you can enter a custom assist attack--and it can be any single attack you want. Normally this would lead to some nasty combinations, but the game doesn't have to worry about such exploits, since there are hard stops in place to prevent them. This opens up a lot more creative freedom for team synergy and combo potential. Skullgirls is filled with these little touches that should make any fighting fan happy.        If a healthy dose of cleavage also puts a smile on your face, then Skullgirls can provide. The game is a well-shaken cocktail of violence and erotica served with a side of smooth jazz. Blow for blow, it pairs devastating uppercuts with all the up-skirt shots a hot-blooded enthusiast can handle. It's difficult not to have an extreme reaction, whether positive or negative, to some of these character designs. It's a risque style that weighs potential alienation against exposure. And while exaggerated, hourglass figures aren't new to video games, their sheer abundance here can be embarrassing for members of all sexes.     The Skullgirls universe is centered on a malevolent MacGuffin called the Skull Heart. Each character has her own reason for hunting it, and the narrative tries harder than most fighting game narratives to establish reasonable motivations. The story mode is a typical collection of fights interspersed with dialogue. These scenes are filled with unique artwork that fleshes out the vast array of supporting characters working behind the scenes. Arcade mode is available as well, and it pits you against a randomly generated series of teams leading up to the final boss.     While the story is serviceable, the tutorials are where the game excels. They explain some fundamental concepts that have gone unspoken in many other fighting games (the basics of movement, defending against cross-ups, and capitalizing on hit confirmation) and give you a better understanding of how to approach a fight. They can help you succeed not only in Skullgirls, but in other fighting games as well. However, one critical element is missing: character-specific move lists. It's an unnecessary hurdle for players who are unfamiliar with these characters, which is just about everyone. Hopefully a list will be patched in later, but for now its absence is missed.   Street Fighter III: Third Strike Online Edition, GGPO effectively hides Internet lag by substituting slight input lag to compensate. The result it a fight that seems lag-free, though your character might not always attack on cue. Thankfully, as long as your connection is in the green, you won't be experiencing much lag of any kind. Below that point there are occasional performance dips.        Unfortunately, the game lacks some of the modern conveniences in other fighters. Spectating support is one, which the game works around by restricting room size to only two combatants. Replay support is also absent, which is especially unfortunate since observing others is an excellent way to improve your own skills. Compared to the PS3 version, Skullgirls on the 360 has slightly longer load times, as well as an infrequent bug where a character model is briefly replaced by green hit boxes. However, these are minor annoyances, and shouldn't distract significantly from the rest of the game.     At the oh-so-attractive price of $15, Skullgirls is a great value. Its strong fighting system can stand toe-to-toe with genre regulars, while the lessons taught in the tutorials should be adopted in all fighting games. There's plenty of fun to be had with the lovely ladies of Skullgirls, as long as you don't mind a little jiggling along the way.  "
4886,Mortal Kombat: Special Forces,2.0,0,"For a fighting game series, Mortal Kombat has an irregularly deep back-story. This long-running tale of a fighting tournament that maintains balance between the earth realm and Outworld has been in motion for around eight years. While the series has more than its share of detractors, most of the games in the series have been rather good. Lately, however, the Mortal Kombat mythos has lost a great deal of steam. Mortal Kombat 4 wasn't received particularly well, and the series' first non-""fighting game"" entry, MK Mythologies: Sub-Zero, wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms, either. Still, you got the impression that the people working on the games genuinely cared about them and took the time to ensure that the storyline maintained most of its continuity. Mortal Kombat Special Forces contains none of this, resulting in holes in the plot, slapdash level design, and a general sense of ""Let's just make sure the game doesn't crash so we can get it on store shelves and earn back at least a little bit of the money we spent"" on Midway's part. Mortal Kombat Special Forces' instruction manual claims that the game strives to fill in some of the blanks about the rivalry between Jax and Kano. But the game really creates more questions than it answers. For instance, if this is supposed to take place before the first Mortal Kombat game, why does Jax have metal arms, which he didn't receive until Mortal Kombat 3 was released? Possible continuity problems aside, Special Forces is decidedly low on story. The game opens with a '70s cop-show-style intro movie, and from there, cinematics of any kind are extremely hard to come by. Between levels, you're given a small bit of story progression via radio transmissions that take place between Jax and Gemini. Gemini stays behind at the Special Forces HQ, while you, as Jax, plod through several locales, beat the pulp out of numerous thugs, struggle to find keys, hit switches, and fight bosses. You're given many of Jax's standard attacks right off the bat, but executing special moves such as the dash punch and ground pound use up a portion of your special meter, which is replenished by executing combos. Defeating enemies earns you experience points, and every time you level up, you're given a new combo move. The combos are MK3-style button-tapping combos, though they require little to no sense of timing at all - just hit the buttons in the proper order, and you'll execute the ""git some suka"" or ""super uppercut"" moves with ease. As if having to use a combo called ""git some suka"" weren't bad enough, Jax occasionally does a bit of trash talking when you execute a combo. This means you'll get to hear Jax say ""Want some fries with that whoop-ass?"" significantly more than you want to. As you progress, the combos become more and more devastating, some of them even ending in fatalities, provided that the enemy's life bar runs out as you're delivering the final hits. The game is really driven by collecting items. To progress, you'll need to find tons of keys, security passes, and the like. The game is seen from a multitude of seemingly random camera angles, none of which give you a clear-cut view of the action. In fact, the later levels are downright frustrating - almost all your enemies are armed, and they can see (not to mention shoot) you long before you have any idea that they even exist. They rarely miss, so your only options are to run in the direction of the shots until you see the enemies, pull out a weapon of your own, and spray fire in the general direction of the shots or use the game's atrocious first-person mode. If you're armed, you can use first-person mode to more accurately direct your fire, but it's limited in that zooming in with the sniper rifle doesn't affect the draw-in distance. So if an enemy is out of your normal sight, zooming in won't help at all. In a word, MK: Special Forces is ugly. The models are blocky, and the textures are horrifically muddy. Occasionally, walls burst at the seams, and the clipping is also fairly random. Backing that up is the sort of soundtrack that demands to be silenced. The music is overly repetitive, the sound effects are drab, and the voice work is dull and uninspired. Even at a semi-bargain price of $19.99, Mortal Kombat: Special Forces isn't worth your time, let alone your money. Even die-hard Mortal Kombat fans will be sorely disappointed with Midway's latest offering, so we'll just have to wait and see if the MK series can recover from this near-fatal blow."
4687,Sammy Sosa Softball Slam,3.0,0,"In the copycat world of sports video games, it's unusual to find a game concept that's never been done before. So it's something of a wonder that the preferred sport of the bearded, pot-bellied, blue-collar American is just now making an entry into the video-game market. But even though the game may deserve some credit for originality, the sheer lack of quality throughout the game keeps Sammy Sosa's Softball Slam from being anything interesting. Sammy Sosa's Softball Slam makes an over-the-top arcade-style approach to softball, portraying it as the silly, somewhat outrageous ""sport"" it is. There are no professional players here - just beer-guzzling guys and well-endowed women out in the park for a little fun. The game does a good job of staying with this theme, as fielders will often flub catches, basemen will overthrow their bases, and runners will occasionally plow over the ball carriers. The gameplay is just about as simple as you could possibly get - when you're pitching you can choose from one of four pitches, and when you're batting you can choose from one of three swings. There are none of the complex ball-angling or pitch-prediction techniques found in most other baseball games on the market - just a simple single-button hit-the-ball-when-it's-over-the-plate technique that gets boring pretty quick. Once the ball is hit, the computer switches you to the nearest fielder and shows you exactly where the ball is going to land with a huge circular icon - stand anywhere underneath it, and you've got a great chance of catching it. Tossing the ball to the bases is pretty intuitive, as Softball Slam uses the diamond button-for-a-base scheme so common in other baseball games. Still, playing the game really isn't that fun, as the overly simplistic nature gives you almost no control over your players. The addition of flaming homeruns and power throws - throws that light on fire and are faster but less accurate - really do nothing to help the gameplay. The first thing you'll notice about this game is just how ugly it is. Simply put, the graphics are way below par - not only is the animation of all the characters extremely choppy, but the textures and backgrounds are pathetic. There are almost no shading and lighting effects, and the characters look extremely polygonal. The backgrounds are both blurry and pixilated, and making out exactly what's going on while you're fielding is sometimes difficult. On top of that, your batters will often go into a practice animation or taunt in the middle of the pitch, only to suddenly jump into the swing animation when you press the button. This effect not only looks ridiculous, but it also makes it that much harder to judge the pitch. The sound is really bad too. Not only does the game feature an overobnoxious announcer who unsuccessfully tries to get you into the game by screaming things like ""It's wild! It's crazy!"" when you get a base hit, but the taunts from the stands are enough to make you go insane. You're guaranteed to hear ""Hey, your shoe's untied"" at least twice for every batter, making this game infinitely better without the soundtrack. There's no in-game music, and the ambient sound effects really make you wish they had put some sort of music in the game.While the game offers you the option of creating your own team, the options are extremely limited. When playing a coed league, you'll have to have an equal number of guys and gals on your team, and you won't be able to change their order. The options that it does give you are pretty ridiculous - you'll be able to change your players' name, size, weight, and a few of their stats, but you won't be able to change their actual faces or hair color. The edit-player mode also features a ""transform to Sammy Sosa"" button, which, when pressed, transforms the character into Sosa as if he were some sort of fleshy Optimus Prime. Unfortunately, once you press the button you can't change back, meaning Sammy's now stuck on your team. Also, while the mode uses a point system to measure stats on each of the different players, it doesn't regulate your spending, meaning you can simply pump all the stats up to their max without giving it a second thought. All in all, the edit-team options are so limited and tedious that it's not really worth spending the time to use them. While it's nice that more arcade-styled takes on regular sports are showing up on consoles, Sammy Sosa's Softball Slam is a poor example of how games like this should be done. This game simply screams mediocrity, as almost every aspect of this game is substandard. While casual gamers might want to give this game a rental, those looking to experience a little softball action should simply go outside and do it the old-fashioned way."
3447,Disciples III: Renaissance,6.0,1,"      It's a shame that the audio is lackluster, because Disciples III is a very attractive game. The creative creature models are a standout, including both stunningly original designs (like the lumbering, skull-knuckled incarnation of the mythical tiamath) and inventive reimaginings of genre standbys (like the glowering, leaf-maned unicorn). The lush environments are also a highlight, enticing you to explore every road and forest path. Trees reach high into the sky, giving the maps a refreshing sense of verticality, while elsewhere molten rock seethes beneath the surface, suffusing the land with a foreboding menace. As you explore and capture power nodes, your faction's influence spreads throughout the land. Not only does this bring vital resource-producing structures under your control, but it literally transforms the world. Turning a blackened lava field into a verdant forest is just as visually satisfying as when the tables are turned and you are the one scorching the lovely autumn woods.           Your army, by contrast, can level up only in limited ways. They earn experience in battle and receive automatic attribute boosts for leveling up, but to really increase their effectiveness, you have to build certain structures in your capital city (as the tutorial fails to explain adequately). In keeping with Disciples III's excellent art design, the luminous capital cities draw on fantastical inspiration to create uniquely imaginative places, and each building you purchase and upgrade enriches the cityscape. Aside from a few special structures, most buildings enable a specific type of unit to upgrade to a more powerful unit. Most structure trees take branching paths, and your choices have important tactical ramifications for the rest of the scenario. Do you want mages with the ability to attack all your enemies at once, or mages that can summon elemental warriors to fight by your side? Demons that do heavy damage to one target, or demons that can strike any adjacent target? Working out the differences between units can be a hassle because of the inelegant interface, but exploring the upgrade possibilities and seeing how your lowly elven scout evolves his martial prowess is intriguing.               Editor's Note: Many customers have experienced a disc detection error with their retail copies of Disciples III, and while developer Kalypso Media has addressed the issue on its forums, the issue remains unresolved. This issue did not affect the downloadable Steam version of the game that we played.     Your army, by contrast, can level up only in limited ways. They earn experience in battle and receive automatic attribute boosts for leveling up, but to really increase their effectiveness, you have to build certain structures in your capital city (as the tutorial fails to explain adequately). In keeping with Disciples III's excellent art design, the luminous capital cities draw on fantastical inspiration to create uniquely imaginative places, and each building you purchase and upgrade enriches the cityscape. Aside from a few special structures, most buildings enable a specific type of unit to upgrade to a more powerful unit. Most structure trees take branching paths, and your choices have important tactical ramifications for the rest of the scenario. Do you want mages with the ability to attack all your enemies at once, or mages that can summon elemental warriors to fight by your side? Demons that do heavy damage to one target, or demons that can strike any adjacent target? Working out the differences between units can be a hassle because of the inelegant interface, but exploring the upgrade possibilities and seeing how your lowly elven scout evolves his martial prowess is intriguing.      Yet for all the promise this system offers, it ends up feeling fairly limited. You can choose only one upgrade path per unit per scenario, so even though your faction may have 22 different creatures, you get to use only some of them over the course of a given scenario. Most upgrade paths do a decent job of balancing both sides, but some choices are clearly superior, leaving the inferior choice as little more than eye candy. The variety of units you can recruit is further limited by campaign-imposed restrictions that seem geared towards easing your learning curve with each faction. While this device is fine during the first third of the campaign, by the time you switch factions it feels like an unpleasantly artificial gimmick.    Still, there is satisfaction to be found in leveling up your hero and upgrading your army through combat. The spacious hex-based maps are a change for the series, and randomly placed damage-boosting spots add a nice tactical wrinkle to character movement. You control each of your units in turn, choosing where they should move and whether they should attack or take a defensive stance. Each unit can use potions to heal and buff your teammates, as well as a wide variety of spell runes that damage enemies, help allies, or even summon new creatures into the fray. Some units, including heroes, have special skills that further expand your tactical options, and using your army's might to vanquish a tough enemy is very rewarding.    However, despite the variety of actions at your disposal, combat ends up being a fairly shallow affair. While you are still familiarizing yourself with your units and your potential enemies, battles can be tense and uncertain. But it's not long before you know both your units and your foes well enough to reliably predict the outcome. Given that you can preview every enemy in every stack of creatures you encounter, you rarely get into a fight without knowing what you're up against. If things look tough, you can bombard an enemy stack with spells before even entering combat to soften them up. Once you're confident of victory, taking the time to sit through unit movements and attacks becomes tiresome, and the quick battle button becomes more and more appealing. Though you'll take more damage than you might if you were in direct control, the quick battle AI resolves the conflict in seconds in a reliable fashion. The enemy AI is not very challenging and almost never surprising, and precious few fights demand your full tactical attention.     Disciples III tries to avoid this combat rut by busting your troops back down to recruit level often throughout the campaign. You must then repeat the process of saving resources, building upgrades in your capital, and leveling up your units. This cycle gets an injection of novelty when you eventually switch factions, but in between these moments there are hours of familiar monotony. Ultimately, your hours of playing Disciples III will blur together, and not in a good way. Battles become routine, even though the units you fight and spells you cast are often very cool looking. Exploration loses its appeal, because every element of the gorgeous environments looks familiar. And building structures and leveling up no longer feels like exciting progress, because the result is a foregone conclusion.   There isn't enough depth to Disciples III to keep things exciting throughout the whole campaign, but the reliable rhythms of exploration and combat offer a steady supply of languid satisfaction. The stellar visual design is a treat even after you've poured tens of hours into the campaign, but even hulking beasts with human torsos coming out of their backs lose their edge somewhere along that lengthy journey. There aren't many stand-alone maps available for non-campaign play, and the only multiplayer option is hotseat. Having a human opponent always offers more of a challenge, but the creeping monotony that plagues the whole game remains an issue. If you're looking for a beautiful, fantastical world where you can while away the hours in idle exploration and simple combat, then Disciples III is a pleasant destination. But if you want a tactical challenge, strategic gameplay, or an engaging campaign, Disciples III is likely to disappoint you.    "
3471,Blacklight: Tango Down,8.0,2,"  Cheap and nasty aren't two words generally used to extol the virtues of anything outside of a red-light district, but they accurately describe the very good Blacklight: Tango Down. Zombie Studios has done a tremendous job with this multiplayer first-person shooter for Xbox Live Arcade, delivering a remarkably feature-filled game for just 1,200 points. While there are some rough spots here, like the worthless single-player/co-op mode and a few grievances over map design, you get a lot of action for just $15. All of the console shooter basics are covered here, and the design also incorporates a few twists so that it doesn't feel like you're playing a bargain-basement Call of Duty.        Along with the lack of a plot is the lack of a solo mode of play. Single-player and co-op available via the Black Ops option is a waste of time. Taking on four maps full of bad guys either alone or with up to three buddies sounds cool, but the reality is a lot less interesting. Maps are thoroughly linear. You trudge forward, kill the bad guys until they stop spawning, and occasionally open a barrier by playing lame minigames, including a variant on Simon. Firefights can be very tense because just a couple of shots can kill you, and the game ends immediately as soon as you die (there is no save option, even when playing solo). But predictability soon wins out because enemy soldiers do little aside from find cover and hunker down, only peeking out regularly to open fire. Levels quickly turn into creepfests because you have to keep your head down and slink forward until you find a good firing position of your own. Battles are somewhat reminiscent of the gunfights from the Police Squad TV show, where Frank Drebin and the villain of the week would exchange shots from a few feet apart while hiding behind garbage cans.       So adversarial multiplayer is the main focus. You get a full-featured multiplayer shooter here, too, with seven modes of play. These modes aren't exactly revolutionary, dealing with tried-and-true game types like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Last Team Standing, Domination, and the usual variations on Capture the Flag (here called Retrieval) and Search and Destroy (here called Detonation). Still, they are more than capable versions of familiar favorites, spiced up a little by varied weapon kits that let you play a number of different roles, from sniping specialist to gung-ho assault-rifle guy. You also get to use gadgets like your visor and the digital grenade, which is a fantastic little helper when you need instant cover to get out of harm's way. A lot of people are playing right now as well, so you can step right into a match at just about any time of the day or night. Player ranks are visible on the opening match screen, so you can tell if you're getting into a game with suitable opposition. This is vital because there is a wide discrepancy between players. Experience gained in matches is used to level up, which unlocks upgrades to weapon and equipment loadouts with various stocks, barrels, and other add-ons. This makes a huge difference in how games play because seriously leveled-up players have access to tricked-out weapons that can turn out your lights with a single squeeze of the trigger. It's frustrating when you're on the other end of a blast like this, but at the same time, getting gunned into dog food serves as a tantalizing lure to keep you playing so you can eventually earn a torso shredder of your very own.     Map design is quite good. Tons of cover is spread around in the form of things like concrete barriers, dumpsters, alcoves, and random wreckage, which makes every map a tactical challenge where you need to think about your moves. At the same time, maps aren't rat warrens of hidey-holes that campers love to use to spoil everybody's fun. Everything also makes sense. Maps are fairly tight and sensibly constructed, so you can't really get lost or even go for more than a few moments without encountering somebody who wants to kill you. A couple of maps lean a little too heavily on narrow alleys that are too cramped to afford much in the way of free-roaming play, although most have a good blend of corridors and open spaces. About the only serious annoyance comes from fixed spawn points that can be besieged in team games, which occasionally turns matches into assembly-line carnage where you take turns lining up to shoot opponents as they emerge from their HQs. The hyper-reality visor helps somewhat with this by letting you spot spawn campers, but there are often too many enemies waiting for you. Knowing the location of the gun barrels doesn't help in these situations as much as simply being quick and very accurate with your shooting.       Map visuals are a grim and atmospheric take on future city streets that have been turned into shot-up battlefields. Burning cars are strewn all over the pavement, and buildings typically look like something out of a documentary about Berlin at the end of WWII, giving you a great impression of being stuck in the middle of a war zone. The setting is a bit too bleak at times, especially with the addition of a grungy techno score that you might think you've heard in a thousand previous end-of-the-world games, but it mostly works at setting a mood. Another interesting angle frequently reminds you that your commando is viewing the gameworld through a computerized visor, via neat touches like digital artifacting when digital grenades go off. It sort of provides a game-within-a-game effect. Ads are probably the biggest buzz killer, as billboards for ATI, Alienware, and the developer dot the landscape. They're not always in the frame, although this relative rarity just seems to make them all the more jarring when they do appear. It's off-putting to turn a corner in a blasted-out urban hell and walk right into an ad telling you that you'd be better off playing the game on an Alienware PC.     For multiplayer shooting on a budget, you can't go wrong with Blacklight: Tango Down. You easily get more than your $15 worth here, and the gameplay offers a change of pace for those who are getting a little burned out on the multiplayer in full-price games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. A handful of tweaks would be welcome, particularly when it comes to map spawn points and the disappointing solo/co-op mode of play, but you really can't nitpick considering how much you're getting for a very reasonable price.  "
707,Cuphead,8.0,2,"But difficult battles only tell half of the story. Cuphead's 1930s cartoon aesthetic is endlessly charming, popping with color and expression unlike anything seen at this scale in a video game before. And now that it's available on Switch, you can get a closer look and admire the artwork in the palm of your hand. The sheer variety of characters and settings yields consistent delight as you go from one stage to the next, with everything bearing the telltale signs of grainy film and rudimentary production techniques. Cel-shading means one thing to a lot of people, but Cuphead truly re-creates the look of hand-drawn cel animation.The characters and bosses that are clearly inspired by cartoon legends like Betty Boop break free from the expected to surprise you with something new. Never mind that Betty's lookalike is a mermaid now; it's the moment her head breaks free from her body and spews caustic skulls that gives you pause. If you can appreciate the unique animation style, you will be doubly impressed when you see what developer Studio MDHR has brought to the table. If its technical execution wasn't enough, MDHR's creativity puts Cuphead in a league of its own.A world map sets the stage for your adventure. As a Cup-thing who gambled with the devil, you now must go around collecting debts from the devil's other acquaintances--the game's bosses. Outside of one-on-one fights, you also have a few opportunities to run and gun through less-imposing platforming stages. These help break up the action and give you a chance to collect coins that can be cashed in for ""weapons"" and passive buffs. Coins are in short supply and can only be collected once, so farming to gain an advantage is out of the question. These stages don't compare to Cuphead's main attractions, but they add valuable substance nonetheless.The mix of ammunition for your handgun--character fire from their fingers--includes the likes of a spread shot, a charge blast, and a boomerang round. There are six in all, and each comes with a secondary attack that's tied to a meter that fills when you successfully land shots on enemies. You can also earn meter by parrying pink projectiles and enemies, a task that requires you to jump towards an enemy and then tap jump again at just the right moment before impact. These range from a fireball and a ring of damaging gems to a burst of bulky, short-range arrows. Finally, you have a super art, which can only be fired when your entire meter is full, as opposed to spending one section of that meter to fire your weapon's secondary attack. The one catch here is that when your meter is full, you can't perform a secondary attack--you are inconveniently forced to unleash your super art, which isn't always desirable.Given that you are able to equip two weapons at once, the variety of loadouts you can equip before a fight allows for flexibility on your part. While you may benefit by bringing a specific set of arms into some boss battles--say, using tracer rounds to pick off minor enemies swarming overhead--you can still carry whatever you wish into battle so long as you have the confidence and knowledge meet the challenge ahead.Learning the bosses' attack pattern is oftentimes half the battle, and it's typical to run through a fight multiple times until you see everything that might get thrown your way. Every boss fight consists of multiple stages or forms. Bosses will change shape, position, and behavior with each new phase. And within an individual phase, you may see as many as four different attacks, though you aren't always guaranteed to see them all during subsequent fights. When bosses begin to mix multiple attacks at once, the potential for various deadly combos keeps you on your toes no matter how familiar you are with the fight in question.The fear of the unexpected is part of what makes Cuphead such a thrilling game, beyond the frantic moment-to-moment tension. You only have three hit points per stage by default--you gain a fourth if you equip a charm that also weakens your firepower. But when the only question in your head is, ""In what order will the boss' attacks appear?"" fights take on less-appealing light after the dozenth attempt. It's in these moments you start to identify a few places where Cuphead could do a slightly better job of keeping you informed of your own progress and capabilities.You never can tell exactly how close to death--or a phase change, for that matter--bosses are. At best, you can see a plotline of the battle after death, to loosely gauge your relative progress. In the face of defeat, you may begin to question if you're carrying the right tools for the job. Beyond revisiting old fights, which is more arduous than it should be as you traverse the map slowly and can't fast travel, there isn't a great way to familiarize yourself with new weapons. And there's, unfortunately, no way to tell exactly how much damage one weapon does compared to another. Vague descriptions are all you get.If Cuphead's fights were indeed puzzles with one correct solution, this would be incredibly frustrating. As it stands, there's only a small amount of frustration to be found while fumbling with new weapons and dying in the process. It may sound like a minor thing to praise, but the fact that boss battles reload in one or two seconds is a godsend when it comes to trial-and-error tactics. And no matter how frustrating a boss may be, you can't escape the draw of their expressive animations.Cuphead does support two-player local co-op as well but it's pretty evident that this makes life more difficult for you and your partner. Despite the intricate chaos that you face alone in any given fight, when you add another character and more projectiles on screen, playing with a friend makes it far more difficult to discern your surroundings, and much easier to slip up. You do have a small window of time to revive a fallen comrade by parrying their ghost, but it's a mere few seconds while it floats up to the top of the screen before disappearing for the remainder of the fight.For anyone interested in getting a taste of Cuphead without facing almost-guaranteed defeat, there are simpler versions of every boss that you can fight--but you won't be able to access the final battle unless you beat every standard boss on the normal difficulty. And in reality, you may as well stick with the standard fights as Cuphead is relentless no matter how you play."
1807,Dungeon of the Endless,7.0,2,"    There is a lot of strategy to consider as you hunt down your exit. Dust is a limited resource, and you almost never have enough to power every room in each expansive level. Lighting a room stops enemies from spawning there, but the longer you take to find your way out, the more darkened rooms are left behind--each one capable of spawning dozens of monsters. With this in mind, you are left with the task of how to best manage your heroes. A favorite strategy of mine involves taking the fastest members of the group as a scouting party while placing stronger (but slower) heroes in a darkened room to keep enemies from spawning or at choke points with turrets to halt the march of any attacking foes.

60,Humanity,8.0,2,"This is the premise of Humanity, a new spatial puzzle game from developer Tha and publisher Enhance Games. Players familiar with the Enhance Games library of titles like Rez and Tetris Effect likely have some idea of what to expect: an artsy experience with chill vibes, minimalistic yet striking visuals, intuitive gameplay, experimental music, and an undercurrent of positivity and warmth. Humanity ticks all of those boxes off easily, while also establishing itself as a unique and charming puzzle game that both calls back to old favorites and adds interesting new innovations.As the nameless meme-dog, you are tasked with guiding the stream of humans that emerges from a mysterious portal ""into the light""--a specially marked square on the field. To accomplish this, you place directional commands on spaces where the flow of humans are walking. If they need to turn left to avoid careening into a pit, you bark and leave a marker to tell them to turn left. Simple! It's a little bit of Lemmings, but perhaps more akin to Dreamcast sleeper classic Chu Chu Rocket.But then things get more complicated. Stages (known in-game as ""trials"") are broken up into sets of ""Sequences,"" built around new abilities and gameplay elements. The levels become tall, towering structures where height and depth are prominent factors. Gimmicks appear, such as fans, conveyor belts, and switches that require a flow of human traffic to activate, forcing you to learn how to effectively herd the masses. Suddenly, you have the power to make the humans jump over obstacles, to float in the air, or break into separate groups. You learn the things humans can do inherently without your guidance: Climbing. Swimming. Grouping together to push heavy but movable objects. A rival faction, known only as the ""Others,"" appears. Weapons appear. And yet, throughout it all, you struggle, you persevere, and you guide humanity to the light for an unknown yet seemingly noble purpose.Many stages contain a giant, golden human avatar called Goldy, who represents the wishes, dreams, and desires of the populace. Goldy must be touched by and assimilated into the flow of humanity as well, and guided to the exit. Yes, you can usually finish the trial without all of the Goldys, but not always. And you will need a certain number of Goldys not just to get a bunch of neat new options and cosmetic unlocks, but to open the final trial of each sequence. For what is humanity without its dreams and desires? Just an endless, mindless march.It all starts simply enough, though. The way Humanity gradually builds, easing you into new mechanics and gameplay concepts, is immensely satisfying: Your reward for overcoming a difficult trial is something new and exciting to experiment with and challenge. Controls are simple and intuitive, and the basic visuals make it easy to understand what's going on at a glance--a blessing when thousands of humans are flooding out into the level. Humanity is an easy game for anyone to pick up and play, and that's great.The visual and control simplicity does cause some problems at times, however. In particular, the platforming elements can be a little bit fiddly. It's especially hard sometimes to tell at what depth and position your dog-avatar is at, leading to many instances where you find yourself careening off a cliff. (You can't actually die, but it can still be an annoyance at times when you need to move and react quickly.) Surmising what platforms you can and can't scale without a bit of help can be a bit tricky, too. If you're lucky enough to be playing the game in stereoscopic 3D with VR, however, I'm sure this is much less of an issue.Physics also plays a part in several of Humanity's puzzles: Jumping, floating, pushing, and group movement are among the mechanics you're taught from a very early stage in the game. They can feel awkward to work with at first, but I eventually got a grasp on how they functioned through a lot of trial and error. Sometimes, however, unpredictable things happen. Large crowds can sometimes push a few stragglers out of the boundaries you've set,causing a host of unexpected problems as they hit hazards, move objects, and trigger switches you didn't intend them to. This tends to happen more often when using the fast-forward feature--which you'll use a lot. It's frustrating to have to restart a stage because a few stray humans were pushed out of their ""herd"" and caused problems.As part of Humanity's accessibility features, every puzzle includes an optional video showing a correct solution (though not always how to obtain the Goldys). As someone who does not consider themselves particularly good at spatial puzzles, I am not ashamed to admit making use of this feature at times when I felt completely, hopelessly stumped. But it's an inelegant and somewhat overbearing way of helping folks. A hint system would have been a welcome addition; I often felt like sometimes, all I needed was a little nudge in the right direction rather than having the whole solution spelled out for me.You can just look up what you need in the video, but navigating playback using only the PlayStation controller is… not great. Some sort of rewind feature would also be nice for those times when you mistakenly lay down the wrong command or screw up a directional input and mess up minutes' worth of setup. The need for multiple trial-and-error restarts can be aggravating.Taken as a whole, however, Humanity is a charming, engaging, and inviting puzzle adventure of a breed that seems all too rare nowadays. Its constantly-evolving gameplay, unique premise, and striking audiovisual landscape make for a game that's easy to get sucked into for long periods of time. Even better, when you finish the main game, you can dive into the various user-created levels folks all over the globe are already crafting--or try your own hand at creation. Creation is something humanity excels at, after all."
814,Child of Light,8.0,2," Because this is the Ultimate Edition, there are bonus features that weren’t included in the original release. A couple of alternate skins for the protagonist are available from the onset along with a few items, one additional skill, and a new mission. It’s still the quiet adventure that is the main draw, though, and whether you’ve never before experienced Princess Aurora’s adventure or simply want to revisit this dreamlike world, Child of Light is just as great as it was years ago. -- October 11, 2018, 10:30 AM PT "
768,Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom,8.0,2,"You play as Jin, a blue-haired young man who must stop his drunk uncle Nabu from inflicting curses upon the kingdom's inhabitants and transforming them into animals. Unfortunately, the plot doesn't really expand beyond that initial premise. With the exception of some moments of levity provided by the cast of interesting supporting characters, the story is uninspired and concludes on a final act that feels shoehorned. But where Monster Boy's narrative lacks in imagination, it more than makes up for it with its well-honed character transformation mechanic.Over the course of the game, Jin unlocks an arsenal of equipment and gains five animal transformations--pig, snake, frog, lion, and dragon--each of whom has their own unique abilities. Jin's human, frog, lion, and dragon forms are also able to equip a variety of weapons, shields, and armor, all of which can be upgraded. Equipping items unlocks new abilities--one type of boots allow you to walk on clouds, while another allows you to double jump, for instance. Quickly swapping between all these different forms to take advantage of their strengths adds a continually enjoyable layer of thought to the platforming experience, and its strengths are regularly showcased by Monster Boy's excellent puzzle design.You're eased into each new animal form and piece of equipment with some basic obstacles and enemies before being set loose to explore the titular Cursed Kingdom. Puzzles scattered throughout require some thought; on several occasions, you'll be forced to combine the use of several different powers and abilities in creative ways in order to progress forward or reach a treasure. It might be juggling two different animal forms, using particular equipment abilities, or taking advantage of environmental items, and when you eventually figure out how to get there, it always feels rewarding. Puzzles become increasingly complex, the variety of enemies becomes tougher, and the platforming sections feature additional obstacles that require more precise timing as you progress, but the growing challenges are balanced out well by a forgiving number of checkpoints, which help you keep motivated to give things another try.While the game is primarily linear, the Cursed Kingdom itself is enormous and features several different secret-filled areas (discovering everything will likely blow out your playtime to roughly 15-20 hours), and the variety of puzzles and charming locations that you find in far corners of the world are themselves an attractive incentive to reach. The experience is doubly rewarding when you unearth new paths while revisiting a previously-discovered area armed with a bigger arsenal of animal forms and skills, and Monster Boy even implements a teleportation mechanic to alleviate frustrations of excessive backtracking.Monster Boy also boasts a brilliant visual and audio presentation that makes the Wonder Boy aesthetic shine, featuring a meticulously detailed hand-drawn art style. Each character is beautifully realized with their own delightful animation--little details, like the pig's sheepish look as he farts after eating a power-up plant or the frog eyeballing some flies as part of his idle animation, adds volumes to Jin's characterization and the game's charm. Every area of the Cursed Kingdom is also visually distinct and beautifully animated, and a couple of superb anime-style sequences that bookend the game help give it a slick, cohesive feel. The game's strong soundtrack helps round out the package and features both original pieces influenced by Wonder Boy's soundtrack, combined with new, rock-influenced arrangements of Wonder Boy's most memorable tunes, making it a great collection of music both new and old.Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom not only pays faithful homage to Wonder Boy, particularly The Dragon's Trap, but by refining the solid foundations of its spiritual predecessors with modern affordances, it becomes a rich platforming adventure in its own right. With a well-realized world filled to the brim with secrets and excellent platforming mechanics that always keeps things interesting, the Cursed Kingdom is a place you will want to discover every corner of."
3651,Taz Wanted,5.0,1,"The voracious Tasmanian Devil (or ""Taz"" for short), who's famous for his loud, incoherent gibbering, his ability to turn into a hyperactive brown whirlwind, and his love of eating pretty much anything, has been a member of Warner Bros.' classic Looney Tunes cartoon cast for years. So it would make sense for him to eventually become the star of his own game. And Taz Wanted gets off to a good start: The game features colorful, cartoon-style, flat-shaded graphics, a decent soundtrack, and voice acting ripped straight from the cartoons. But after you play Taz Wanted and struggle with its terrible camera angles and repetitive tasks, you'll probably agree that all the authentic cartoon characters in the world couldn't make this game fun, even if Taz Wanted does come packed in with an extra free game.   The ""story"" behind Taz Wanted, such as it is, involves Taz and his hapless girlfriend, who are both captured by the rootin'-tootin' cowboy Yosemite Sam and placed on display in a zoo as prize exhibits. Taz eventually escapes, but not before the ornery Sam grabs his lady friend and flees, so it's up to Taz to chase him down through the game's 15 levels and save the girl. But you find out about this story only after you start the game. In the introduction sequence, you'll actually see Taz accidentally crash into such Looney Tunes luminaries as Sylvester the Cat, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd--but you'll see hardly any of them throughout the actual game. In fact, other than the game's tutorial, which is given by Tweety Bird, and an occasional cameo from Yosemite Sam, the appearances by other famous Looney Tunes characters are few and far between, so if you were looking to pick up Taz Wanted in hopes of visiting all your favorite characters, you'll probably be disappointed.   Unfortunately, Taz Wanted's actual gameplay is worse than disappointing. The game is a third-person platform-jumping action game that has frustratingly bad camera angles and repetitive, boring tasks. In each of the game's levels, you play as Taz, and you must destroy seven ""wanted"" posters, as well as complete optional goals like collecting 100 sandwiches, destroying 50 percent of the destructible objects in each level (which come in the form of crates, treasure chests, or lunch boxes, depending on which level you play), or collecting a secret golden Yosemite Sam statue. Regardless of the task at hand, Taz Wanted's camera follows Taz much too closely--it's practically glued to Taz' back and doesn't let you zoom in or out to get a better view of your surroundings. The camera also jerks about wildly whenever you try to make any kind of turn.    And the camera just doesn't work in Taz Wanted's multitiered levels. Taz has to run up walkways, drop down sinkholes, climb through tunnels, and jump up different series of stairs and platforms, and the camera tends to get stuck behind walls or high over his head, sometimes completely obscuring him from view. Many of Taz Wanted's tedious jumping puzzles, which involve Taz simply jumping to the next platform to reach the next wanted poster (or the next springboard to boost him to the next wanted poster, or the next cannon to shoot him at the next wanted poster), aren't even that challenging. But the clumsy, spastic camera makes them needlessly difficult, so much so that you'll find yourself repeatedly walking around that same corner, climbing up those same steps, and hopping up to that same ledge until you finally make the jump. You can stop everything and rotate the camera around Taz when he's standing still, but you can't successfully do this while he's jumping or when he's trying to avoid getting captured by Yosemite Sam's goons.   Luckily, if Taz gets captured or falls in a lake or gets gobbled up by a passing shark or alligator, he doesn't die--he just reappears nearby, and if he's captured by an enemy, he just loses money. For some reason, Taz earns thousands of imaginary dollars for destroying wanted posters, which he can use to unlock such uninteresting secrets as storyboard drawings of himself and of some of the buildings and platforms he jumps on. Taz Wanted also has several minigames that you can unlock either by collecting 100 sandwiches in a level or by fighting the boss of each area, but none of these are especially fun, and several of them (especially the ones that require you to smash a number of items within a certain time limit) have the same camera problems as the regular game.   It's too bad that Taz Wanted plays so poorly, because the game actually looks and sounds surprisingly good. Taz Wanted is a very colorful 3D game that uses cartoon-style graphics for its characters, like Taz and Yosemite Sam, and Taz's movements, mannerisms, and his trademark whirlwind look very authentic, even though the game's environments, and some of its enemies, look plain in comparison. Taz Wanted's music generally consists of generic, upbeat pop-music-style tunes that turn into electric-guitar remixes when Taz uses his whirlwind ability, while the game's voice actors are the same ones that are used for modern-day Looney Tunes' cartoons. Some of the voice samples do tend to run together, and in other cases, the sound at the end of a voice sample drops completely, but by and large, Taz Wanted actually looks and sounds as you'd probably hope from a game like this.   Normally, the review would end right about here, but in this case it must be noted that the retail PC version of Taz Wanted also packs in a free bonus game--a port of the 2001 PlayStation game Sheep Raider, which stars Sam the sheepdog and Wile E. Coyote as Ralph the wolf. In this game, you play as Wile E. (who plays as Ralph) and use stealth and gadgets to get past your burly sheepdog nemesis. As you'd expect, Sheep Raider for the PC looks and sounds like a spruced-up PlayStation game, featuring simplistic flat-shaded characters and environments, generic music, and sound that has a tendency to skip, mainly because you don't even install the game on your hard drive, but play it off the CD instead. Then again, it's a free game, and considering that solving Taz Wanted's repetitious puzzles tends to be pretty time-consuming, you've got a suite of games that can actually keep you busy for quite some time--if you can actually stand the games themselves.   Who should actually get Taz Wanted? Parents who want to occupy their very young children--children who are so young that they don't know enough to find Taz Wanted's poor gameplay to be frustrating, maybe. Or fanatical Looney Tunes fans who have to collect every last little Warner Bros. souvenir, maybe. Everyone else would probably be better off giving it a pass."
4716,Apocalyptica,3.0,0," Recently, Konami quietly released Apocalyptica, a third-person-perspective action game for the PC. The game was originally slated to ship for both the Xbox and the PC, but it doesn't take much time with the PC version to understand why the console version was scrapped. Apocalyptica is terrible from top to bottom, suffering from bland, derivative gameplay, simplistic level design, brain-dead AI, and a buggy graphics engine that chugs even at low resolution.      The game's problems start right at the beginning, with the plot. Apocalyptica is set in the future, a time of space travel and planetary colonization. Yet for some reason, your weapons consist of swords and spells, much like in a fantasy-themed game, as well as a handful of firearms. And you're not fighting against high-tech aliens as you might expect from a futuristic game--the enemy is the devil, or Neo-Satan, to be exact. He's unleashed his legion of demons and cyborg evildoers upon the universe, conquering it planet by planet, and it's up to you and a small band of virtuous do-gooders to stop him and send him back to hell. You'll take the role of a genetically reanimated saint or martyr and team up with a few other holy warriors in a series of missions aimed at thwarting Neo-Satan's dastardly plan for universal domination. Really. We can't make this stuff up.   Before the campaign starts, you'll choose from a menu of 16 different holy warriors, each with different ratings in agility, melee attack, ranged attack, and spell proficiency. Ultimately, there isn't a whole lot of difference between most of the characters. Those with high agility move faster, while those with melee get a stronger sword to fight with. The ranged-attack specialists often have an array of different guns at their disposal, but they must worry about finding more ammo for their weapons. In practice, these stats don't mean a whole lot, because combat in the game just devolves into a lot of button mashing. The exception lies with the few warriors who can cast spells; they have the distinct advantage of being able to heal themselves as well as their teammates, which can make the campaign much, much easier.   Apocalyptica's 18 missions are spread out over five different settings ranging from planet surfaces to starships to hell itself. The mission types hearken back to Unreal Tournament's assault mode--in most cases, you and a small band of computer-controlled teammates must run a gauntlet of different objective points, capturing each as you go along. Sometimes the game will mix it up by adding in a timer, having you rescue prisoners or escort scientists, or including some other challenge. There's even a boss enemy at the end of some levels that's only slightly tougher than regular foes. But in general, it's just you and a few of your reanimanted martyr buddies against legions of hellspawn.   The game's AI, both for friend and foe, is highly unsophisticated. Your sidekicks and enemies alike will often get themselves stuck on level geometry, and enemies never exhibit any behavior more complex than running straight at you and attacking. You have the ability to issue simple commands to teammates, either as a group or singly. These commands include ""follow me"" or ""guard this area."" Unfortunately, these team commands are ineffectual, so your teammates will often ignore them to go off on their own. In missions where you must capture and hold several points, you'll curse your sidekicks' inability to follow orders as the mission degenerates into a game of musical chairs where you can only hope to prevail by dumb luck.      Unfortunately Apocalyptica's presentation is no savior; it's just as bad as the gameplay. The game's graphics engine looks primitive, with clunky character models, stilted animations, and dated-looking spell effects. Compounding these problems is the fact that the engine is extremely slow. Even if you're playing at low resolution, frame rates appear to dip into the teens when large melees break out, which can make precise aiming just about impossible. We were also unable to play the game at any resolution other than 800x600--any attempts to change the resolution resulted in graphical glitches, namely a flickering image and ugly white lines drawn horizontally across the screen. Sound effects and music were similarly buggy; both would simply cut out on occasion. When the sound did work, it wasn't particularly noteworthy anyway.   The game does include 10 multiplayer maps for deathmatch and capture the flag. There are no active servers to play online, however, and our few attempts to play over a LAN were thwarted by system lockups or the inability to make a connection.   A visit to the game's official Web site to look for a possible patch took us to a blank site occupied by a domain-name squatter. All indications are that Konami cares very little about Apocalyptica. You shouldn't either. "
1066,XCOM 2,9.0,2,"The new XCOM 2 expansion, War of the Chosen, expounds upon that foundation in every way. The baddies are tougher and your own troops have more strategic and tactical counters, but they're also more human and, in some ways, more fragile. Together, these feed into not just the complexity of XCOM's already robust chess-like play but the human edge as well.XCOM has always found its grounding in its characters. You, as a player, are encouraged to name the members of your resistance after your friends and family. After some time on the battlefield, they grow more experienced and versatile, developing new skills and finding their own, ad-hoc narrative slices.During my first run, I remember one of my high-school friends, Ben, grew to become my top soldier. A pinpoint sniper, Ben could deadeye any foe from 100 yards--easy. But the long slog of the war with the aliens left him traumatized. And, over time, he became a glass cannon. His mind was rattled by intimidation, and his frail body ached. On his 60th mission, he was brainwashed and slaughtered by his captors.These sorts of vignettes flow organically in XCOM 2, but War of the Chosen explores them more fully. First, soldiers that spend lots of time together form close relationships, conferring battlefield stat bonuses as well as fodder for whatever backstory you choose to conjure. War of the Chosen encourages you to create inspirational posters for your warriors, too, to post around your base. Between missions, you'll see the beaming faces of your finest dole out propagandic slogans. It doesn't affect anything outside of aesthetics, but it's a tacit acknowledgement that your team and their connections matter, and it's a simple way to reinforce the desperation at play. Each of these soldiers, though they march into battle, often without ever questioning their commander, are still human. They need faith, and they need symbols of victory that encourage them to press on.Of course, this is something of a red herring. War of the Chosen wants you to use these features--kindling relationships with characters like Ben and leaning on them for your own sort of moral support--so that it can bludgeon you with hopelessness down the line.For every fun little addition War of the Chosen slots into XCOM 2, it also adds something more sinister. The eponymous ""Chosen,"" for example, are an elite trio of champions that are hell-bent on capturing and torturing your soldiers, picking their minds clean so they can take aim at you.That places a grim and sobering filter over everything else. You send these people out to fight and die, and you have to carry the knowledge that if they suffer, it's because you failed. And, what's worse, if they're captured, they'll face far more pain and anguish not because of anything they did, but because your resistance continues to frustrate your presumed overlords.To balance the scales a little, you'll also be able to tap three new factions for your burgeoning Squad. The Templars, for example, are powerful mind-wizards who loosely counter the Warlock, one of the Chosen and a psychic warrior whose mind has been twisted by obscene power. The Reapers and Skirmishers round out your ranks with stealthy-snipers and gruff, short-range assault troops, respectively. Each of them comes with special skills so as not to overlap with your more basic, rank-and-file soldiers.Each of these add-ons might be a solid inclusion on their own (who wouldn't want cadres of super-soldiers to shore up the ranks?), but War of the Chosen wouldn't work without all of them.The new factions are introduced early, so players who finished the base game have some new meat to sink their teeth into. Everyone else? They get a straightforward introduction and continue on as normal. The key, though, is that a Reaper can help you expand your tactical options early on, where stages--bereft of the reverse-engineered laser cannons that show up dozens of hours later--could use a little more excitement.This makes the first few hours a bit easier than the rest, but this affords you room to experiment before the truly punishing moments appear. After all, characters who aren't watched have a tendency to be ripped apart or shot to bits. Having a souped-up fighter in the field affords you some flexibility: As with a queen in chess, you can adjust your plans on the fly, leveraging that additional power at key moments--either for offense or defense. But, as with the queen, losing such a valuable soldier can hurt doubly so.The Chosen play a similar role, dropping into missions and harassing your teams whenever possible. They learn and grow from battle to battle, too. It's not quite as robust as the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor, but they will adapt to your tactics, covering their weaknesses over time. That makes them exceptional foes down the line. In essence, they become bosses that dog you and wear you down, an omnipresent threat that could hit at any time.As the game marches on, you are beset on all sides by powerful foes that force you to adapt. Your own soldiers might grow as well, but when your elite squads are picked off, or they've grown weary and fatigued, or when they lose their best friend or lover, that loss is palpable.War of the Chosen packs in appreciable new layers of tactical and strategic depth that breathe new life into what was already one of the genre's best. But it is, once again, the humanity of the fight that binds it all together. New factions wouldn't work without new challenges, and new bonds are strained by foes that seek to quash opposition not with overwhelming force, but by cracking your will. If one mission goes particularly south, you may be forced to bury far more well-trained fighters than you can replace. And when you can't quite field the strength you once did, you might not have the drive to keep going. You share not only in new powers, but in the pervasive defeat felt when they are taken from you.Everything that Chosen brings--from the elite soldiers to the deeper connections between your squads--feels like a living part of the XCOM universe. If you like your deep strategy and brutal turn-based tactics alongside brilliant interplay between camp and emergent drama, there is none better."
3473,Ancients of Ooga,7.0,2,"     You play as the Spirit of Ooga, a caretaker deity that can possess the Oogani: the gawky, multicoloured gremlins that  worship you. You must unite the seven Oogani tribes against the bovine Booli who have enslaved them by freeing captives and resurrecting the leaders of the tribes. Cue seven chapters (say, eight or nine hours) of item-gathering, lever-pulling puzzles that are spiced up by your ability to flit between bodies, as well as the themed powers unique to each tribe and its leader. The feathered Flapper tribe can fly, for instance, and the fishy Swimmer tribe can breathe underwater, with their respective chieftains able to call up winds and floods.       Each of the seven chapters--split into bite-sized levels--has you release captive Oogani from cages, gather together their tribe, and revive their dead chief with a ritual bonfire (read: item hunt). Then, playing as the resurrected chief, you exterminate a map's worth of Booli enemies. It's a cycle that serves the game's premise well enough but doesn't add much challenge with each iteration or build up to a sufficiently epic finale. Navigating the levels demands you open gates by variously pulling levers, weighting pressure pads, or delivering items to sacrificial altars, as well as using the Oogani's special abilities. Some can walk through lava, some are immune to poison plants or spiky thorns, and some can swim faster or jump higher. These special abilities are introduced gradually, tribe by tribe, but once you've acquired the full and diverse set of Oogani powers, it's a great shame the game's puzzles don't get much more taxing. They don't generally ask you to use more than a couple of powers to get past an obstacle; for example, you may perhaps be asked to switch between two different Oogani on either side of a locked gate.           With some nice but underexploited ideas and without any truly tricky puzzles to overcome, Ancients of Ooga is no more or less than a fun and simple puzzle-based platformer. At eight or nine hours per play-through, it's a good-value download, with moderate replayability supplied by collectables (bones and edible items). The minor difficulty progression and cartoony humour make it best suited to younger players. Consider checking it out in a dry spell of must-have downloads and indie sleepers--just don't go ahead and cancel your weekend plans for it.     "
2142,FIFA 14,8.0,2,"      Career mode has received some much-needed tweaks, including the option to disable the first summer transfer window, finally giving you the chance to maintain a real-world squad up until the January transfer window. A Global Transfer Network has been introduced too, which masks a player's overall rating (OVR), so you've absolutely got to use scouts to find the best youth players. A tile on the Career mode page keeps you up to date on scouting progress, letting you choose to move forward with in-depth scouting, after which the OVR is finally revealed and you can decide who to purchase. This is far more engaging than simply hitting up the search box and looking for players with the highest OVRs, and it means you've got to put a great deal more thought into your purchases. Fun skill minigames, swift loading times, and some excellent commentary (complete with rambling pre-match banter) put the finishing touches on what is a fantastic football experience. And, like previous FIFA games, FIFA 14 is beautifully presented. Animations are smooth, and famous players, kits, and stadiums are faithfully re-created with great attention to detail. too perfect, and a little bit of grit here and there, along with some players who don't look like they've lost all feeling in their upper bodies, would go a long way towards making the game look even better, though it's still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Despite the lack of a defining new feature to attach itself to, FIFA 14 is far more than the sum of its parts. Despite the lack of a defining new feature to attach itself to, FIFA 14 is far more than the sum of its parts. It's a fundamentally different experience to last year's game, and an entertaining one at that, moving the series ever closer to the realism it so proudly strives for. The only competition FIFA has this year is itself. With a next-gen version just on the horizon, complete with a brand-new engine, you may be thinking about sitting this one out until then. But to do so would mean missing out on what is a fabulous football game, one that feels fresh yet familiar and that pushes even FIFA veterans into new, exciting, and engrossing ways of playing."
2472,Batman: Arkham City,8.0,2,"Batman: Arkham City, the Caped Crusader faced one of the greatest adventures yet in his legendary career. Now, that game has made its way onto the Wii U as Batman: Arkham City - Armored Edition. The new touches added here don't contribute much to the experience, and occasionally risk interfering with it, so there's no reason to buy this version if you have access to others. However, the Wii U version is still an excellent game, one that's absolutely worth playing if you haven't yet stepped into the batsuit and explored the open-air superprison of Arkham City.      Batman: Arkham Asylum, the city of Gotham has fallen on dark times. Certain unscrupulous characters took advantage of the crisis by acquiring the run-down neighborhood of North Gotham, walling it off from the rest of the city, and tossing criminals in there to fend for themselves. It's an inhumane and immoral operation; food and warmth are scarce, and some inmates are people whose only crime was voicing a negative opinion of Arkham City and those who run it.      But their misfortune is your gain. The area of several city blocks that makes up the superprison isn't especially vast as open worlds go, but what it lacks in scale, it more than makes up for in atmospheric detail. Arkham City is home to an old courthouse, a former police headquarters, a musty museum, a disused subway terminal, and other fascinating places. These structures, with their faded portraits, old billboards, and plentiful other features, convey a sense of history, and the art direction that makes this vision of Gotham so fantastic is in full effect on the Wii U.     Batman has no choice but to explore the alleyways and underground tunnels of North Gotham. Within the prison's walls, Joker is dying, and the villain's schemes force the Dark Knight to help him find a cure. That quest brings Batman into contact with the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other members of Batman's rogues' gallery. Each character is represented terrifically, with plenty of nods to their histories as established in the comics, and part of the fun of progressing through the story lies in seeing what character might make an appearance next. The excellent Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their roles as Batman and the Joker, heading up an ensemble of voice actors who never miss a beat.        Naturally, Batman's errand brings him into constant conflict with the many thugs and lowlifes lurking in the shadows of Arkham City. The game's combat is outstanding; there's a rhythm to chaining together your strikes and counters, and successfully keeping a chain going for a while is immensely satisfying. Your attacks are accompanied by terrific animations that look simultaneously graceful and brutal, and the increasingly varied configurations of enemies you encounter as the game progresses require you to frequently alter your tactics.     Of course, thugs with shields, blades, and body armor are one thing; enemies with guns are something else entirely. Batman is tough, but far from invulnerable, and when faced with such firepower, it's time for him to rely on stealth. Batman has an assortment of sneaky techniques at his disposal, all of which are great fun to use. Crawl up to an enemy from behind, and you can take him down silently. By hanging from a gargoyle, you can ensnare an unsuspecting enemy below with an inverted takedown. The excellent sound design adds tension to these stealthy standoffs, with bad guys becoming increasingly frightened as you pick off their buddies one by one.      One addition to the Wii U version of Arkham City does take some of the bite out of combat, though. Batman's suit now comes equipped with what's called Battle Armored Tech mode, or B.A.T. As you fight enemies, your suit stores up kinetic energy, and once you have a full charge, you can trigger B.A.T., which makes your blows do twice as much damage and activates a visual filter that highlights enemy positions. Part of what made the combat in Arkham City so involving was that every strike mattered and that Batman was fragile enough that missing a counter could be a costly mistake. Being able to do more damage at set times means you can worry about precision a little less, and this eliminates the exciting balance that combat previously maintained. Of course, you're free to just ignore B.A.T. and not use it, but you can't turn it off entirely.        Another silly addition to Armored Edition is sonar, which lets you see indications of nearby enemy positions, as well as the locations of nearby collectible Riddler trophies, on the GamePad screen. Batman's detective vision, which lets you see through walls and easily spot any enemies in the area, is much more useful than glancing between the GamePad and the television to plan your next move, and manually spotting and tagging those Riddler trophies you don't know how to snag just yet is far more involving than letting the sonar do it for you.     Other implementations of the Wii U's GamePad to perform certain functions are more sensible, but don't appreciably improve the experience. When Batman investigates a crime scene, for instance, you can now move the GamePad around to search for clues; it's a nice option, but hardly a meaningful addition. Similarly, you can tap the GamePad to detonate explosive gel if you prefer that to the button command. Armored Edition's best use of the GamePad is not in the gameplay at all, but in the sound design. Now, radio transmissions, and all the enemy chatter that Batman intercepts, come through the GamePad's speaker, giving them a distinct, crackly sound.      These transmissions are a frequent accompaniment to your travels. One of the greatest joys of Arkham City is the act of moving around its open world. Thanks to your grapnel gun, Arkham City is a veritable playground for you, with all of its buildings for you to grapple onto and soar off of. Once you get the hang of generating momentum with your dive-bomb move, you can soar through the city, diving and climbing like a roller coaster. It's an exhilarating way to travel. And if, as you're flying high above the streets, you spot a group of thugs and fancy a fight, it's easy to plummet straight down and plant your boot in a goon's face.      Arkham City also acknowledges that Batman's brains are at least on par with his brawn. Occasional clever environmental puzzles, such as a situation involving a pool of water covered in thin ice, frozen cops who need to be saved, and a giant, deadly shark, require you to make smart use of your gadgets. More significantly, the Riddler is in town with nothing to do but torment Batman. As previously mentioned, Riddler trophies have been placed throughout Arkham City. Some of these collectibles have been hidden in the city's nooks and crannies, and if you locate them, you can simply pick them up.     However, in many cases, the trick is not locating them, but figuring out how to get them. There are Riddler trophies in plain view all over Arkham City, but they're enclosed in cages, and to retrieve one of these, you must figure out how the mechanism for that particular cage works. There might be a series of switches on a nearby wall that need to be triggered in a particular order. Or it may be a test of agility, with a switch that opens a gate some distance away that you have only a short time to reach before it closes. Some of these puzzles are surprisingly tricky, but there's always a discernible logic that makes working out the solutions rewarding.     In addition to his trophies, the Riddler has a new set of environmental riddles for you to solve. Some of these take the form of questions or statements, such as ""Do you have Strange thoughts? Maybe you should seek help?"" and ""I am an actor who can transform a film with the final cut. Who am I?"" Answering these requires you to locate the sign, storefront, or other environmental detail that contains the answer. The richness of the world already makes exploring it a pleasure; tracking down these solutions makes doing so even more engaging. Each of these that you solve unlocks an Arkham City story, which offers some textual background on the people associated with that particular riddle, deepening the neighborhood's sense of history.        Solving these conundrums doesn't just reward you with a bit of text, though. The Riddler has also kidnapped hostages and placed them in riddle rooms throughout Arkham City, and the only way to get the locations of these rooms is by completing enough of the Riddler's challenges. And foiling the Riddler's plot is just one of the numerous side quests you have the option of pursuing or ignoring during your time in Arkham City. You'll almost certainly want to complete many of these, though. These engrossing quests often make great use of villains from the Batman comics who don't play a role in the main quest, and they have their own story arcs that are worth seeing through. They're also fun to play. There are strings of murders to investigate that have you analyzing crime scenes, following bullet trajectories and trails of blood. There's a madman who forces you to race across town to answer ringing pay phones before time runs out and he kills a hostage. There are innocent political prisoners who need your help. And much more.     All of the downloadable content that was available for earlier releases of Arkham City is included in Armored Edition. This means that the Catwoman chapters, which were accessed with a code sold with other console versions of the game, are automatically incorporated into the story here. Playing as Catwoman is enjoyable; she has just enough abilities that are unique to her to make her feel distinct from Batman, while controlling similarly enough to feel immediately familiar. She can cling to certain ceilings and use her claws to scale walls, and her caltrops and bolas can be used in combat to trip and immobilize enemies. And although Batman's Armored Edition suit makes him look a bit more like a chintzy action figure than he did previously, Catwoman's new outfit here is far more practical than her original Arkham City getup.     Once you complete the main story, you unlock the new game plus option, which lets you carry over your upgrades but also makes your life more difficult; you have to do without the helpful lines that appear in combat informing you that an enemy is about to strike. But once you've spent that much time with the game, you'll likely be ready for this challenge. And there are a host of challenge rooms that test your skills both in all-out combat and in stealth situations. Some challenges take the form of small campaigns that alternate between combat and stealth scenarios.         Each campaign assigns you an assortment of modifiers and requires you to use each of them once. One modifier might benefit you, perhaps giving you regenerating health, while another might benefit your enemies, perhaps giving one a protective aura that prevents him from taking damage. These modifiers, and the tactical process of applying the detrimental ones to the easier scenarios and the beneficial ones to those scenarios you might have a tougher time with, make these campaigns feel distinctly different from the encounters you have during the story.     But more than anything else, it's your adventures and explorations in the city of Arkham itself that make this game extraordinary. The B.A.T. option added for this edition of the game only interferes with the tense and rewarding combat, but that doesn't need to come between you and one of the best action adventure games of recent years. From the speedy exhilaration of soaring high above the streets to the atmospheric thrill of discovering long-forgotten secrets in the tunnels below Gotham, this is an unforgettable adventure that will keep you coming back to the cape and cowl long after you've seen the credits roll.   "
3253,LittleBigPlanet 2,9.0,2,"LittleBigPlanet, the creativity of the game's community continues to impress. Tools that were designed to let users craft their own levels for the popular platformer have been masterfully manipulated to make all manner of weird and wonderful gameplay experiences, 3-million-plus of which live on in LittleBigPlanet 2. The superior creation tools that you're afforded access to in Sackboy's second outing are sure to send that number skyward soon, and even if you have no desire to make your own masterpieces, you're sure to enjoy the incredibly varied fruits of developer Media Molecule's labors, as well as those of other players. For creators, LBP2 is an easy-to-use tools package that lets you turn your ideas into games that can span multiple levels and genres, and even include cutscenes. For players, LBP2 is a game that lets you play all of these creations in addition to its own charming and impressively varied Story mode. Everyone's a winner.        Regardless of what you ultimately hope to get out of LBP2, the Story mode is a great place to start. The world of LittleBigPlanet has come under attack from the evil Negativitron, and only you (and up to three of your friends) can save the day. The 30-plus Story mode levels are incredibly varied both in terms of gameplay and visual design. One moment you're jumping between moving wooden platforms and swinging from sponges; the next you're riding a bee through a blocky-looking side-scrolling shooter and knocking enemies out of the sky with honey projectiles. Then, after using sticky cake projectiles to solve simple puzzles, you might find yourself cruising through another character's body and using white blood cells to combat a meanie infection. Each and every one of these levels serves as an enjoyable showpiece for what LBP2's new creation tools are capable of, and playing through the Story mode is even more fun than in the original game because you never know what the next level is going to have in store for you. Furthermore, Story mode levels have plenty of replay value if you're interested in finding all of the collectible materials, stickers, Sackboy outfits, and other goodies that have been expertly hidden away.     A number of the Story mode's collectibles can only be reached if you're playing cooperatively in a group of up to four players. Sequences that require multiple players are rarely complex, but even relatively simple objectives can be tricky to complete if you have to enlist the help of someone who isn't familiar with LBP's floaty physics or comfortable with how Sackboy moves between the foreground and background. Furthermore, playing cooperatively (especially locally) can get pretty confusing because, unless all of you are moving in sync, the camera becomes problematic. First, it zooms out in an attempt to keep all of you in shot, which can make distinguishing one Sackboy from another difficult. Then, if that fails, it leaves the player or players who are lagging behind for dead and they rejoin the action at the next checkpoint. Some levels fare a lot better than others in multiplayer, but often, the most enjoyable way to get items from multiplayer areas is to have friends hop into your game only when they're necessary, which is unfortunate and not much fun for them. For a fun multiplayer experience, your best bet is to check out some of the new versus games which, once you unlock them in Story mode, include enjoyable takes on basketball, air hockey, and pool, to name but a few.        Armed with the items that you've collected in Story mode, as well as any that you've imported from your original LittleBigPlanet profile, you might be eager to jump into Create mode, but you'd do well to check out some of the new creation tutorials beforehand. The adequate though not entirely comprehensive tutorials are again wonderfully narrated by Stephen Fry, and even if you consider yourself something of an expert with the first game's tools, there's a lot of new ground to cover. Sure, you can safely skip the tutorials on gluing, corner editing, bolts, and basic sensors, but what about Sackbots, power-ups, microchips, and the gameplay sequencer? These are just a few of the new creation tools at your disposal in LittleBigPlanet 2, and they are quite literally game-changing additions. For example, Sackbots are non-player characters that can be customized with different appearances and behaviors; you can use them as actors in cutscenes, as enemies that are intelligent enough to avoid hazards and use power-ups, or--as they appear in the Story mode--as friendly little guys that you must either lead or herd through levels. Microchips, on the other hand, are a strictly behind-the-scenes innovation that give you a big flat space upon which to arrange multiple logic pieces (timers, randomizers, and the like) that might otherwise be confusing and difficult to arrange when applied to an object.       Power-ups are another excellent addition because, much like the paintinator gun that was introduced in the LBP Metal Gear Solid expansion pack (and which, like all of the original LBP's downloadable content, works with LBP2), they open up many new possibilities when designing levels. The grappling hook lets you swing from any object that it can grab onto, the grabinator gloves give you the strength to pick up and throw heavy and dangerous objects, and scuba gear lets you swim underwater without having to seek out oxygen-filled bubbles or come up for air. The most exciting power-up, though, is the creatinator; a helmet that can be used to fire any projectile that game designers choose and that includes user-created objects. Want to create a level in which Sackboy puts out fires? Give him a creatinator that fires a steady stream of water. Or how about a versus game in which two of you compete for high scores while shooting at enemies whose faces are photos of your friends taken with the PlayStation Eye? Easy, just load up the creatinator with missiles, fireballs, impact explosives, or some projectile of your own invention. You can even have the creatinator launch objects that then fire projectiles of their own. The possibilities are endless.        Perhaps the most significant game changer introduced in LBP2 is the controlinator; a small and unassuming device that, amongst other things, serves as a seat for Sackboy in vehicular gameplay sequences. More importantly, the controlinator can be used to give the players of your games and levels direct control of any object--effectively taking Sackboy out of the equation. Used in conjunction with the new antigravity object tweaker, the controlinator makes it painless to create side-scrolling and dual-stick shooters, tower defense games, top-down racers, and games in which you control nothing but a crosshair and a trigger, to name but a few. As a creator, you even get to map all of the controls of your games yourself, simply by using invisible wires to connect the buttons and analog sticks on a picture of a Dual Shock controller to the movers, rotators, emitters, and other devices that you want them to trigger.     Working with audio in LittleBigPlanet 2 is only as complicated as you want it to be. Different material types all have default sounds associated with them so, for example, when an item made of wood crashes into an item made of metal, what you hear is believable. That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. There are dozens of great licensed songs and original music tracks included, along with loads of sound effects and even a selection of gibberish voices that you can assign to your characters. As with other aspects of creation in LBP2, you're given more than enough professional quality items to work with, but you're also afforded access to the tools and raw materials that you need to make your own. For starters, there are dozens of instrument samples that you can use to create your own tunes using the built-in sequencer, and if you want your characters to be voiced or your game to be narrated in some way, you can record your own samples using a headset or the PlayStation Eye mic.      If you're a creative type willing to put in some serious hours testing and improving upon your designs, there's no reason you can't share games with the LBP2 community that are good enough for players to come back to again and again. You might even receive requests to make sequels. Of course, not all of the creations that find their way into LBP2's community area will be very good or even worth playing. Already, numerous levels are appearing--just as they did for the first game--that serve no purpose other than to unlock trophies for anyone who plays them, while others simply aren't finished. Thankfully, there are some solid systems in place to help you sort the good from the bad. The option to rate levels after playing them with between one and five stars from LBP has been replaced with a simple smiley- or sad-face option that allows you to see, at a glance, how many players enjoyed it versus how many didn't. When browsing levels, you can also see how many players have completed them and how many liked them so much that they took the time to bookmark them with a heart. After playing a game, you have the option to write a full review for it and select tags relating to the experience (""short,"" ""intricate,"" ""funny""); the game type (""puzzler,"" ""sports,"" ""racer""); and specific content (""collectables,"" ""water,"" ""grappling hook"") that you think apply.      LBP.me community site, and even queue them up for next time you play. Also, as in the original game, it's possible to bookmark your favorite creators so that you can more easily find new offerings from them.     Like the most prolific creators in the series' community, LittleBigPlanet 2 is a game that just keeps on giving. That's also true of the first game, but what separates LBP2 from its predecessor is the sheer variety of games that are being created and will no doubt continue to be created for many months to come. This isn't just a superbly presented game that incorporates multiple genres and comes packaged with a powerful creation suite, it's your doorway into a wonderfully charming, vibrant, and ever-changing universe where almost anything is possible. Even if you're not interested in designing and creating games yourself, LittleBigPlanet 2 is not to be missed.   "
3572,WarTech: Senko no Ronde,5.0,1,"  WarTech: Senko no Ronde attempts to straddle the line between a shooter and a fighting game. You have a top-down view of the action and fire off a lot of big shots, as if it was some sort of scrolling shooter, but you're actually shooting at another similarly armed opponent. You're also given life meters and super attacks, as if it was a fighting game. The idea is an interesting one, but it doesn't come together in a very appealing way. To add insult to injury, Ubisoft is trying to charge full price for what is, essentially, a shallow arcade port that would be more at home as a downloadable Xbox Live Arcade release.        There are multiple characters to choose from in Senko no Ronde, each with his or her own set of attacks, as well as basic moves. These include barriers that shield you or a dash move, and they are shared among all characters. Your attacks vary but usually break down into a normal fire and some sort of special attack, such as homing lasers. If you get up close to your opponent, you can attempt to get a melee attack in, which can be powerful. There are plenty of counters to deal with all the incoming enemy fire you'll be seeing as well, such as a barrier move or your barrage technique, which can hurt enemies if you're successful. But for most characters, these moves are also handy for swatting away enemy shots. When all else fails, you can unleash a B.O.S.S. attack, which changes your ship into a huge monstrosity with super attacks, almost as if it was the boss of a more traditional shooter. Learning how and when to use each attack is key to success because most attacks come with reload times that leave you open for attack if you're careless.     There are multiple modes to play, including a story mode, which follows after fighting games in that there isn't much of a story. You can also go through the story mode in score-attack mode, which has you playing for a high score. One-on-one versus matches can be played locally or via Xbox Live, though it seems like the only players playing online are expert-level Japanese players who will break you off something rough if you aren't up to the challenge. Senko no Ronde was originally an arcade game in Japan and was released in Japan for the 360 last year, so the Japanese players have had plenty of time to practice. Though very few people seem to be playing it online, overall, as it can be tough to find an opponent.     WarTech: Senko no Ronde sounds neat on paper, but in practice, it isn't much fun. Scooting around the arena and popping off shots at your opponent doesn't take much skill, which is usually enough to beat the computer-controlled opponents. The characters are fairly small, though when it zooms in to show a melee attack, you're given an underwhelming look at how plain the different floating robot suits look. The sound is similarly flat, with plenty of basic laser and explosion noises. The characters talk back and forth throughout the battle, which is kind of neat, but it's all in Japanese. Because you'll be too busy fighting to bother reading the subtitles, this makes the whole story mode sort of useless.     Above all, the biggest problem facing WarTech: Senko no Ronde is its price. If this were some kind of 800 point Xbox Live Arcade download, or even a $20 retail game, this would be a reasonable though modest game that you might enjoy. But at its current asking price of $59.99, Senko no Ronde is a rip-off, plain and simple.  "
3846,Bust-A-Move 3000,5.0,1," Though you might infer from the game's title that Bust-A-Move 3000 is the latest and greatest iteration of Taito's long-running puzzle series, this is not the case. It sports a new title, but Bust-A-Move 3000 is identical to the Super Bust-A-Move that was released on the PlayStation 2 in 2000. The game is as playable in 2003 as it was in 2000, which is to say, it's about as playable as the first Bust-A-Move was on the NeoGeo back in 1995.      If you've played any previous Bust-A-Move games, you've played Bust-A-Move 3000. You're presented with a rectangular playing field that is filled with different-colored bubbles. You launch randomly colored balls from the bottom of the field in an attempt to attach them to bubbles of the same color. Once three bubbles of the same color are touching, they pop, and you repeat this process until the field is clear of all bubbles. While Bust-A-Move 3 and 4 both brought a few new gimmicks to this formula, such as conveyor-belt walls and special bubbles, Bust-A-Move 3000 is simply more of the same. The controls remain the same, and the shoddy implementation of analog control will likely have you using the D pad to aim, since you get more precision with digital control. While previous versions of Bust-A-Move featured an overload of gameplay modes to keep puzzle junkies happy, this game is incredibly stripped down. Since it has just three modes of play--single-player, against the computer, and two-player versus--Bust-A-Move 3000 doesn't even come close to the standard set by previous Bust-A-Move games.       To its credit, the Bust-A-Move trademark graphical stylings are in full effect, with no shortage of bright, happy characters drawn in an anime-inspired fashion. It looks about as good as a Bust-A-Move game ever has, with sharp 2D graphics and a healthy amount of visual splendor. This clean, 2D presentation is probably why Ubi Soft opted to turn Super Bust-A-Move into Bust-A-Move 3000, instead of porting the more-recent Super Bust-A-Move 2, which featured some ugly 3D character models, as well as a preternaturally stupid story mode. The soundtrack and sound effects are almost identical to those found in the original NeoGeo version and every version thereafter.   GameCube puzzle freaks who have had their fill of the Monkey Ball games will probably be pleased that a Bust-A-Move game has finally arrived on the GameCube, even though it's a straight port of a two-and-a-half-year-old PlayStation 2 game. Ultimately, the biggest strength of Bust-A-Move 3000 is not its own inherent quality, but rather the distinct dearth of quality puzzle games on the GameCube.  "
3454,BlazBlue: Continuum Shift,8.0,2,"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger made the game a favorite among those who like their characters crazy and their action complex. BlazBlue: Continuum Shift is more of a refinement of the original game than a full-fledged sequel. It introduces some great new modes that make the action more accessible to newcomers, and the new characters and balancing refinements ensure that this is the version of BlazBlue you should own.     As with Calamity Trigger, the greatest asset to Continuum Shift is its tremendously diverse roster of fighters. With 12 returning characters, two new ones available from the start, and a third who can be unlocked or purchased, BlazBlue doesn't have the largest stable of fighters to choose from. But what it lacks in number it more than makes up for in variety. Each fighter feels significantly different from the others, and they run the gamut from accessible characters with movesets that will feel quickly familiar to anyone who has spent time with fighting games, to characters with truly strange abilities that make them considerably more difficult to master. Among these are three new characters who fit right in. Tsubaki is a swordswoman with a shape-changing blade who has some effective combos that are easier to pull off than those of other characters, and whose special ability temporarily increases the power of her special moves. Hazama is a snappy dresser and one of the tougher characters to play effectively. He can unleash a snake-like tentacle called Ouroboros which lets him close the distance between himself and his opponents very quickly. Mu, the unlockable character, is an outlandishly armored fighter whose special ability is placing turrets that blast her opponents. If placed strategically, these can make for some very effective traps, and make her a force to be reckoned with in the hands of those who can use this tricky mechanic well.        Each character has weak, medium, and strong attacks, and a drive, which is a special ability. Those unique abilities are the most dramatic thing that sets BlazBlue apart from other fighting games. On top of that, there are a large number of other mechanics in BlazBlue that can be daunting for newcomers. Heat gauges, barrier gauges, guard primers, and more are on the screen at all times, and making sense of all this is not easy. Making things more difficult is that BlazBlue's fighting system is technical, placing a heavy emphasis on cancels, juggles, and long combos that cannot be escaped. Those who spent a lot of time with Calamity Trigger may notice Continuum Shift's adjustments, but one the whole the refinements are quite subtle. There are new moves for each character, as well as changes to the way the game handles some of the more advanced techniques, yet Continuum Shift's core mechanics feel very much like those of its predecessor, which is no bad thing. It does mean that BlazBlue remains one of the more inaccessible fighters out there, though, and it can be intimidating, even for those who have spent lots of time with other fighting games. Thankfully, Continuum Shift introduces a few modes that make learning the ropes somewhat easier.     The Tutorial mode goes over everything, from the most fundamental basics of character movement, to detailed information about each character's specific movesets and combos, letting you select only those lessons you think might be of use to you. The lectures about all of the various game mechanics are a bit dry and long-winded, but the Tutorial mode is nonetheless a welcome addition. It's also nicely complemented by another new addition, the Challenge mode, which which makes you perform a series of increasingly difficult combos with your selected character. You can display the command inputs on the screen and watch a demonstration of the moves if you're having difficulty nailing the timing. Together, these two modes make an effective and full-featured training tool.      In the end, though, the only way to really learn how all the pieces fit together is to get down to the business of fighting, and BlazBlue gives you a number of ways to jump into the fray. There's a standard Arcade mode that lets you fight it out against a series of opponents with a hint of a story for each character. There's also a much more elaborate Story mode, in which you play as all 14 of the initially available characters. The tale is nearly impenetrable, and it's told in such a bland, uninvolving way via conversations between character portraits that it's impossible to care about it, which seems strange given how much anime-influenced over-the-top intensity is present in the fighting. A good story isn't a necessity in a good fighting game, but BlazBlue puts so much emphasis on its own story that the game definitely would have benefited from some more dramatic flair in the telling.      There's also a pure Versus option for battling the computer or your friends, a Score Attack mode, and a mode called Legion, which is essentially a survival game type in which you move from space to space on a map, recruiting new fighters to your army from the ranks of the armies you defeat. It's a neat idea, but it feels underdeveloped, and since it can be played only against the computer and it never changes, there's little reason to come back to it time and again. Like just about any fighting game worth its salt, this game is at its best when played against human opponents, and like its predecessor, Continuum Shift boasts excellent online play. You can jump into player matches or ranked matches or create your own lobbies for up to six players. Matches can be configured with a variety of options, and while lag can be an issue in some matches, the game lets you filter searches by connection speed, which proved in our experience to be a useful way of seeking out opponents we could battle without any noticeable lag.         BlazBlue's distinctive and beautiful visuals make it almost as interesting to watch as it is to play. The two-dimensional characters are gorgeous, with intense colors and a level of detail that makes them practically pop off the screen. The backgrounds, which combine two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements, fuse the old-fashioned and the futuristic to fascinating effect and provide a lovely and memorable backdrop for the action. The action may actually be overstimulating at times, with so many dramatic effects accompanying so many of the attacks, but all that visual craziness lends BlazBlue its own unique flavor of intensity among fighting games. The sounds are similarly bold and energetic, with the announcer frequently shouting ""Counter!"" and the combatants exchanging compliments and insults throughout each fight, while the stirring score matches the exuberance of the visuals.      With Super Street Fighter IV and now BlazBlue: Continuum Shift, $40 seems to be the going rate for fighting game follow-ups that add enhancements and refinements rather than provide the amount of new content that would justify full price. With only three new characters, this is a tougher sell than Super Street Fighter IV, and given its unabashedly technical mechanics, some players will still find it too arcane for their tastes. But if you are looking for a fighter that's distinctly different from the Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats of the world, Continuum Shift makes it easier to get into BlazBlue than it was before. And if you're already a BlazBlue fan, the new characters and balance tweaks make this the better version of the game.  "
860,F1 2018,9.0,2,"F1 2018 returns to the starting grid with a huge number of different game modes. Take control of your favorite driver in a single Grand Prix weekend, or lead them to the title in one of numerous championship events across varying disciplines. If racing against other players is more your thing, F1 2018 includes both ranked and unranked multiplayer lobbies, along with a full, 21-race online multiplayer championship that can be raced with strangers or friends alike. But where F1 2018 shines brightest is in its Career mode, which sees you assume the role of a custom-created rookie who’s new to the F1 paddock, freshly signed to a team of your choice.Who you sign with will dictate the performance expectations laid out in your contract for the coming season. Sign with a first-class team like Mercedes or Ferrari and you’ll receive a car that’s both capable--and expected--to challenge for wins every race weekend. Sign with a lesser team like Williams or Toro Rosso and you’ll need to adjust your expectations to something more realistic to their performance level, and help the team move up the order through building performance upgrades to improve your chances.New performance parts come quickly in F1 2018 with the upgrade system having been overhauled to give you more resource points for completing team goals. A steady flow of good performances now mean you can afford to bring multiple upgrades to subsequent races, giving you a noticeably better performing car, and a greater shot at a better finish in future events. The faster flow of upgrades feels far more rewarding than the slow trickle of past games, letting you make tangible gains on the opposition over a season. To keep things interesting in the long run, regulation changes at the end of the year can completely wipe out an upgrade tree, resetting the grid order in the process, making it possible for new teams to rise to the top, and the current dominant teams fall to the midfield.Each team has a unique upgrade path for each of the four performance departments, and each can be directly influenced by your interactions with the media, who will hound you occasionally after a session with questions on your performance. Keeping your team morale high will keep upgrade costs down along with decreasing the chances of parts failing during development, while saying the wrong thing and upsetting them will have the opposite effect. Although answering the same questions regularly gets tiresome fast, the resulting morale changes to your team make the hassle worth it.Performing above expectations puts you in a stronger position for contract negotiations, which thanks to the changes to the upgrade system, feels like a more relevant and rewarding process than before. A high driver value gives you more room to push for a deal that will generate more resource points, including the new addition of contract perks, which can grant strong bonuses from extra resource points for upgrades up to faster pit stops.The only disappointment remains the muted damage system, once a marquee feature of Codemaster’s titles, once again looking like it’s been unchanged since the series' early days.Eight new classic cars join the twelve from last year’s F1 game, representing a gorgeous range of vehicles from the sport’s history in addition to the monstrous beasts of the 2018 season. All of the game’s cars look impeccably recreated; the meticulous detailing of the winglets and carbon fiber on the modern cars being a highlight, despite the much-maligned ‘halo’ surrounding the cockpit. Each of the game’s 21 locations has been given a lick of paint, too, and look gorgeous whether under lights, baking sun or a heavy downpour. Joining the calendar for the first time is the new Circuit Paul Ricard in France, a labyrinthian maze of tarmac and colored lines with a slightly confusing layout, and the return of the mighty Hockenheimring in Germany, a personal favorite. The only disappointment remains the muted damage system, once a marquee feature of Codemaster’s titles, once again looking like it’s been unchanged since the series' early days.The difference in driving feel between the modern and classic cars is huge; where the modern cars demand a certain finesse with the controls to get the most speed, the older cars let you slide around and wrestle with the wheel a lot more. But the real enjoyment comes from driving the 2018 hybrids, with their unbelievable power and grip being bolstered by two new simulation elements in the form of the ERS deployment controls and the new tire carcass temperature model.While both sound minor on paper, they make an incredible addition to the element of strategy through a race. The ERS system controls the amount of power deployed from the car’s hybrid battery, giving you six different settings to play with, from zero to full deployment. You can change it on the fly to attack the car in front or defend a move from behind, adding an extra tactical element at your fingertips. It can be overwhelming to manage initially, requiring a little thumb dancing on the control pad--it’s much easier with a wheel. Although if that all sounds too much for you, it can be fully automated so you don’t have to worry about changing it while trying to focus on driving.The tire carcass temperature model is more complex and is the series' biggest step into simulation territory yet, measuring both the surface and inside temperatures of a tire to give a more accurate simulation of how it should wear while you drive on it. If you drive them too hard, or use the wrong compound in the wrong conditions, the tire will overheat and you’ll have to slow down to bring them back into their working temperature range. It puts a stronger emphasis on managing your tires through different driving styles, especially in the longer races, and the way overdriving the tires has an adverse effect on car handling and grip is superb.The simulation-like additions to the driving model bring you closer than ever to the feeling of sitting on the grid with 1000+ horsepower at your feet.The racing AI feel more aggressive than ever in F1 2018, and it makes for a noticeably more intense racing experience. Drivers not only defend the inside line into a corner, they will generally make more of a nuisance of themselves when trying to overtake you, rarely conceding a corner unless you’ve managed to put them in a bad position. Multiplayer has been revamped to include a new safety rating, which measures how cleanly you race in ranked lobbies, and a skill rank to matchmake you with other racers of like skill level. However, due to the pre-release nature of the build, we have yet to test the robustness of these rankings.F1 2018 is brilliant, and the most complete Formula One game to date. The changes to career mode make it the strongest and most appealing it’s ever been thanks to the revamped upgrade system, while the simulation-like additions to the driving model bring you closer than ever to the feeling of sitting on the grid with 1000+ horsepower at your feet, without overwhelming those who just want to jump in and drive. Update: After spending several hours online with F1 2018, in both ranked and unranked modes, the use of the new ranking system shows a marked difference in the quality of racing. Unranked is a wild west of private lobbies and created sessions, and the class of competition can vary wildly. Ranked adds greater accountability with its use of skill and safety ratings, the incentive being that racing cleanly will reward you by matchmaking with other clean racers of a similar skill level. While you’ll still have to dodge the odd non-braker in ranked races, they’re an order of magnitude cleaner than the unranked races, which can quickly descend into farce from the second the starting lights go out. -- James Swinbanks, Aug. 27, 2018, 8:20 AM PT "
271,Inscryption,8.0,2,"Inscryption is an outstanding deck-building card game--until it isn't. At around the halfway mark, the compelling, run-based structure of its core card battles and the intriguingly sinister atmosphere both transform into less interesting versions of themselves. In a sense, Inscryption falls victim to its own hype. So strong are its opening moves that you can't shake the disappointment that much of what follows is merely quite good.The basics don't change. Throughout, Inscryption pits you against AI opponents in a series of card battles. Individual cards have attack and defense ratings and, often, a special ability. You play them, one at a time, into a slot on your row of the arena. Each turn, your played cards will either attack the opponent's played cards or, if the slot opposite is empty, land a direct hit on the opponent themselves, scoring for each point of damage inflicted. Battles are resolved when you or your opponent gain a five-point advantage in damage over the other, a state typically met within a handful of minutes.The core card combat is solid. But what sets it apart from countless other similar deck-builders is how those basic card mechanics are recontextualized across three formats. As you progress through the three distinct acts of its story, Inscryption stops each time to overhaul its card battle system. In doing so, it's able to thoroughly explore different aspects and possible permutations of those basic mechanics. Such tweaks to the rules deliver new challenges that remain interesting, even if they're not an improvement. While the reconfigurations of Acts 2 and 3 over the back half of the game carry plenty of merit, the first iteration you encounter in Act 1 is ultimately the best.The rogue-lite structure of Act 1 lends itself better to the card-battling format, in particular the way its cyclical nature lets you gradually learn how to play without feeling bogged down by repetition. Each run takes place across a map of little branching paths, eventually leading to a boss, and along the way you'll card-battle a handful of enemies and make a few choices about how to improve your deck. Die while fighting a regular enemy and you'll get a second chance. Die while fighting a boss and the run is over, kicking you back to the start and removing the cards you'd gathered for your deck during the last run. By the time you're skillful enough to be making it to the final boss, each run is lasting a mere 20-30 minutes. The turn-around is pretty swift and, while it can be frustrating when the luck of the draw means you didn't get the card you wanted at a critical moment, the minimal time investment means it's easy to shrug off failure and jump straight into a new run.Failure is even incentivized with the Death Card system. Die on a run and you get the chance to create a new card that draws upon the stats and abilities of some of the cards you collected along the way and becomes a permanent addition to your deck. There's plenty of luck involved. Sometimes you simply won't draw the cards you really want and your Death Card for that run turns out pretty useless. But on occasion, when luck is shining, you'll end up crafting something ridiculously overpowered. Regardless, the suspense is always there to discover what new card you can create, and if it turns out to be a good one, excitement soon follows at the prospect of drawing it on your next run.The branching structure of a run presents meaningful choices, too. Between fights, if you take the left path, you might be able to draw a new card from your deck, but if you take the right path, you might instead be able to add an ability to an existing card in your hand. One of the most interesting of these choices arrives at a campfire where you can opt to increase the attack or defense of one card, but each time you choose to draw upon the fire's power, you run a greater risk of losing the card entirely. Other stops see you collecting boons that confer powerful bonuses to all your cards or trading for very useful one-shot items.While there's some luck with the exact layout of the map, you always know what's awaiting you at each stop, informing your choices and empowering you to devise a strategy for each run. It's so satisfying to be able to decide on an objective for a run--for example, this time I'm going to stop at all the campfires and buff this one card in order to hopefully get the chance to use it for my Death Card at the end of this run--and then execute it as intended, and with the mercy of RNG. The format and structure of Act 1 caters to this sort of strategic thinking in a far more elegant manner than either of the following Acts.Act 2 suffers from overloading you with too many choices and dropping the run-based structure. Instead of collecting cards from your deck over the course of a run, as in Act 1, here you find or purchase new cards between fights and are able to prepare a loadout to take into each battle. While I'm sure some players will enjoy this more traditional deck-building aspect and embrace sorting through dozens of cards to fine-tune the perfect hand to tackle their next opponent, I found its sudden introduction overwhelming.Exacerbating the situation, while some cards function similarly to those found in Act 1, many new ones are introduced, and you're left to make too many decisions about things you don't yet understand. Paralyzed by choice, I found myself hitting the auto-sort button every time and letting the game select a loadout for me. The connection felt in Act 1, of ownership over a deck populated by cards that you've had a hand in crafting, disappears.Worse, the point of a deck-builder is undercut when it doesn't seem to matter which cards are taken into a fight. At least, I didn't face a fight in the second act where I was wishing I had a specific type of card or felt like I had to rethink my approach and return with a different deck. I was always able to brute-force through with what I had. Individual fights still offer tactical meat, but because they stand alone, there's little of the connective tissue that the run-based structure of Act 1 provides. The greater strategic depth, afforded by having to plan ahead to determine how to best improve your hand, is lost.Act 3 offers the welcome return of some of the Rogue-like aspects of the first act, but repurposes them to less interesting effect. The fixed layout of the map ventures more into Souls-like territory, where you're running back to where you died to recover the currency you dropped and repeating the same encounters along the way. There are still opportunities to improve your cards, but you're not making the same strategic choices about growing your deck as you were in Act 1.The prescribed encounters lend more of a puzzle feel to each battle, which stands in disappointing contrast to the tactical improvisation required to meet Act 1's more randomized encounters. This puzzle feel also heightens the frustration of losing a battle because the RNG didn't serve you up the powerful card you wanted. When RNG fails you in Act 1, you chalk it up to bad luck and move on to a new set of challenges. In Act 3, you've got to re-enter the same ring and hope luck is on your side this time; it's infuriating when it isn't.Linked by a quirky meta-narrative, each act brings a stark shift in presentation. The first and third acts both adopt a diegetic framing for the card-battles, situating you in the room where the act is taking place. You're looking down at the board from a first-person perspective, able to turn to the side to check the score or look up and see your opponent. Immediately, it raises the stakes of each encounter. An early revelation is the ability to stand up and move around the room, accompanied by the startling realization that there's more going on here than just a mere game of cards.Again, it's the first act that proves the highlight. Inside a frontier-styled wood cabin with impossibly dark shadows obscuring all but the eyes of your opponent, a door you cannot open, and shelves arranged with a gothic ephemera, it feels like you're fighting for your life at the end of the world. It's deeply weird and unsettling and evocative of the kind of imminent doom that encapsulates all run-based games.Unfortunately, the following acts pale in comparison. While initially arresting, Act 2's drastic cut to an 8-bit era RPG falls flat. Act 3 returns to the first-person perspective, but in a more generic environment. Neither captures the same creeping sense of dread that permeates Act 1, nor do they succeed in conveying the same feeling that some real weird shit is about to go down. It's not that they're bad, as such; it's more that, in a clear demonstration of the power of thematic context, Act 1 sets a bar that the other acts can't reach.And that really is Inscryption in a nutshell. The first act is just brilliant. Not only is the core card game at its best, but it's also where those mechanics are best served by the richly atmospheric trappings surrounding them. The following two acts admirably offer new twists on the mechanics and a different perspective on the narrative, but neither prove as satisfying as the original. Alone, Act 1 is one of the best games of the year, but everything that comes after drags it back into the pack."
3777,Silent Scope 3,5.0,1,"Silent Scope 3 for the PlayStation 2 is an adaptation of the arcade series of gun games. The arcade versions of Silent Scope all feature an elaborate sniper rifle-shaped light gun that you use to shoot at various targets from long range. A small screen is actually mounted in the scope of the gun, giving you a functional close-up of a small portion of the main display, and simulating what it's like to shoot from long range. Of course, when the game series was brought home to consoles, no rifle came with it, which inherently removes a great deal of what made the arcade series popular and fun. Relegated to gamepad controls, Silent Scope 3 still makes for a decent adaptation of the arcade series, and offers a sometimes enjoyable but extremely brief experience.   Silent Scope 3 actually features two games in one--Silent Scope EX, a direct adaptation of the arcade title, and Silent Scope 3, a game created solely for the PlayStation 2. Silent Scope EX contains a level progression similar to that in previous games. Your character moves around on rails to set vantage points, where enemies pop up, and if you don't shoot them fast enough, they start firing back. Clear them all out, and you get rated based on your accuracy and speed in bringing the enemies down. You are then often presented with a choice of which level section to go through next, though all paths lead to the same place at the end of the game.   The Silent Scope 3 game, on the other hand, introduces a new level-progression structure. After the first level is cleared, you are free to select any level or mission you wish to accomplish next, though they all must be cleared before the game is finished. While previous installments in the series have put a huge sense of time pressure onto the player, some missions in both Silent Scope 3 and EX stress patience and accuracy. The game will present you with levels containing incredibly difficult shots, but you can take all the time you need to make them. Miss one, however, and suddenly your enemies will become aware of your presence and will swarm all over the place, making your life very difficult. As in the rest of the series, health can be regained by locating a woman hidden once or twice in each level and keeping your scope on her for a short period of time.   The control in Silent Scope 3 has been revised somewhat since the last home installment, though most of the conventions are still the same. Your aim is controlled by the left analog stick, which moves a zoomed targeting reticle about the screen. Press the L1 button and the reticle zooms out, allowing for more gross adjustment of your aim as well as a wider view of the action. The game attempts to assist your aim using a ""magnet"" feature. Place your crosshairs near an enemy and it will snap over him and continue to follow him if he should move. This is exceptionally useful most of the time, except it doesn't account for your need to lead shots at distant targets. This also makes lining up a shot near a civilian more difficult. You can disable the lock-on mode, but then it becomes very difficult to make some of the shots that require precision. At a few points in the game you will be surrounded by your enemies and will use the R1 and L2 buttons to turn and change your vantage point. However, because your view snaps to another of four different views, this does very little to break the game out of its rail shooter concept.    Graphically, Silent Scope 3 looks fair. Enemy models look pretty good and are textured and animated well. There's very little variety within a level, though, meaning you'll face the exact same enemy model time and time again. For example, the casino level is filled with suit-wearing shooters, while a plane-hijacking scene contains nothing but masked commandos. The environments tend to seem a little sparse, and the textures don't always look very good, but you will spend so little time interacting with the environment that you'll hardly notice. Sound is limited to mostly gunshots and grunts from your enemies. Your commander will give you the same monotonous advice here and there--at least it's easy to ignore. Music tends to be fast paced and unobtrusive, and in most cases you'll hardly notice it.   Yet for all its shortcomings, the biggest problem with Silent Scope 3 is its length. Because the game is an arcade port, you can literally sit down and finish it the same afternoon you get hold of it, and although you can finish it without playing all of the missions, there is still very little replay value to come back to. Even with the console-only missions of Silent Scope 3, there is very little long-term staying power to be found here. While it lasts, though, the game delivers a solid enough playing experience, and if by some chance you've enjoyed the console versions of Silent Scope in the past, then you'll probably find something to like in this one as well."
1190,Yoshi's Woolly World,7.0,2,"When Yoshi’s Woolly World came out on Wii U in 2015, its well-hidden collectibles seemed at odds with its often breezy platforming--most of the challenge was in finding its secrets, so opting to forgo them made some stages too basic. Updated for 3DS, the leisurely pace of Poochy and Yoshi’s Woolly World feels right at home on a handheld. It’s the superior of the two versions and still works best when you're scavenging for collectibles, though it also has the same balance pitfalls.Poochy and Yoshi’s Woolly World includes all 48 stages from the Wii U version and adds extras, including special Poochy levels and an updated version of the original’s easier Mellow Mode. The standard levels still play well, and the lack of a level timer or lives to lose makes more sense on 3DS, where stop-and-start use is more common. Effortlessly (and adorably) hopping through a single level when you only have a few minutes to spare is a little more satisfying than running through several at a time, and of course, stopping to track down even the most hidden of items when you have more time to spare is still just as rewarding.Though some of the platforming may seem basic for veterans, there are levels that really stand out, like an early Egypt-themed level that expands puzzle-solving beyond collectibles and into the platforming. But Woolly World also has its fair share of levels that don’t require quick thinking or much work at all.Woolly World isn’t boring, though, thanks to its relaxed pace and charm. It’s a good source of laid-back fun in the midst of intense stress, and its lovingly executed yarn theme is adorable. There’s something delightful about Yarn Yoshi eating a yarn enemy and turning it into a yarn projectile--which would normally not be a particularly pleasant idea--or being able to gobble up yarn fire and repurpose it. Even though quite a few levels are a breeze, there’s at least something cute to zero in on.Many Nintendo games strive for accessibility--providing challenges that the player can opt into, choosing just how difficult or deep they want the experience to be. Woolly World does that to an extent, but there’s often a noticeable disparity between casually running through a level and aiming for completion. There’s not really a middle lane of difficulty for more experienced players who want a challenge without having to seek out the most well-hidden items. Some of that is remedied by the move to 3DS, and some of it is made better by an expanded version of the original’s optional Mellow Mode.Poochy and Yoshi’s Woolly World feels right at home on a handheld. It’s the superior of the two versions and still works best when you're scavenging for collectibles.Despite the name, Mellow Mode doesn’t necessarily make Woolly World unbearably easy--though it does keep it accessible for younger or more inexperienced players. Like in the original, switching to Mellow Mode gives Yoshi wings that allow you to float indefinitely, which of course makes it easier to survive (though it’s not guaranteed). On 3DS, Mellow Mode also comes with a few Poochy pups to help sniff out secrets. It essentially bridges the difficulty gap, making platforming and collecting more harmonious. And, since it can be switched on and off in the middle of a level, you can use it sparingly if you’re looking for just a little bit of an edge.And you shouldn’t rely on Poochy too much, because Woolly World really wouldn’t be worth playing without the fun of searching for all its collectibles. There are five flowers and five spools of yarn on each level, and some are almost cruelly hidden. If you’re dedicated, you could potentially spend a lot more time in Yoshi’s yarn world, taking half an hour even on earlier levels to find everything. Getting them all unlocks much harder levels, as well as some adorable Yoshi skins--and it’s rewarding to figure out the tricks and maneuvers you need to find them.For faster-paced platforming, Poochy and Yoshi’s Woolly World has a new addition starring its namesake. It’s an endless runner-style set of bonus levels, and while not punishing, mastering the timing of jumps and Poochy’s signature slide is a different kind of challenge. It’s a welcome change of pace and a valuable addition for the 3DS version, making up for the lack of multiplayer by providing a good single-player diversion.That said, it’s not a reason to buy the 3DS version if you’ve already played the Wii U one, and the extras don’t really give it much of an edge when the best part of the experience was there all along.Though the gulf between two very different difficulties is not fully fixed by its additions, from the updated Mellow Mode to the extra Poochy levels, Poochy and Yoshi’s Woolly World gives you what you put in--it can either be almost frustratingly hard for a determined collector or a good fit for someone who’s just looking for a fun, relaxing few hours of platforming."
3482,Age of Conan: Unchained,8.0,2,"Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures was a brutal and atmospheric dark pearl among fantasy online role-playing games. In the years since, developer Funcom has plugged in most of its gaps, giving the game's first expansion, Rise of the Godslayer, room to shine in its own right. Players between levels 40 and 80 may feel left out in the Frost Swamp, but newer players--and veterans looking to reroll a new character--will enjoy the scenic new lands in the Gateway to Khitai. And if you've reached Age of Conan's level cap and don't mind some tedious grinding, there are plenty of violent pleasures waiting in the new high-level areas. If you've strayed from Age of Conan's blood-smeared trail, Rise of the Godslayer is the reason to return to the service of the Aquilonian king.         Expansions of online RPGs typically add a couple of new classes and, perhaps, an increase to the level cap. Age of Conan: Rise of the Godslayer adds neither, though it does feature a new race: the Khitan. Playing the new race doesn't significantly change how the initial 20 levels in Tortage play out, but it does mean once your initial travails on the volcanic isle are over, you start questing in your homeland: Khitai. If you'd rather visit this level 20 to 40 zone--the Gateway to Khitai--with an existing character, you can pay a caravan master to transport you there unharmed. However, unless you're in a hurry, you should offer your services to this needy chap, as you will then perform one of multiple quests as way of payment. Some of these are conventional scenarios, but others tap into the savage beauty that make Conan an explorer's paradise. In one enjoyable scenario, you fend off a besieging kraken from aboard a rocking ship. In a dreamy underwater sequence, undulating visuals give a simple fetch quest a surreal aura. These quests also serve as great introductions to the Gateway's wilds.      The Far East is Khitai's visual and temperamental inspiration. Provided your system is beefy enough to render these lands in their full glory (and, indeed, the game requires a beefy PC), you'll be awed by the scenery. Red poppylike flowers dot the grasslands, and the autumnal hues of certain trees provide a lovely contrast to the craggy mountains in the distance. Once you reach level 80 and can further explore Rise of the Godslayer's new zones, your appreciation will only grow. Somber ambient music (all of it uniformly superb) and deep lighting make Chosain Province's charred villages seem so grim you can practically smell the blood. Sparkling creeks ripple through the northern grasslands, where creatures battle each other when you haven't engaged them in combat yourself. The vistas are vastly different from those you see in Cimmeria and Stygia, but they still capture that special Age of Conan vibe, where pastoral grace competes with the ghastly sight of murdered corpses hanging from gnarled branches.      The combat hasn't strayed from the combo-focused swordplay and sorcery that delight Age of Conan fans, but the expansion offers quality reasons to put your battle skills to good use. Quests are of the usual kind: Kill this many number of things, collect these objects and bring them back, free these prisoners by clicking on them, and so on. Good quest writing gives these quests context and keeps you pushing forward. When a distraught local pleads with you to put the spirits haunting him and his fellow villagers to rest, you sense his desperation. You may feel as evil as the traitorous soldier that asks you to carry out a malevolent task on his behalf. Foes that you and your teammates take on within the Gateway include Hykranian archers, wild yaks, and demonic creatures called the kang zai. There are also fun boss fights in store for you, such as the apelike king lurking high in the cliffs near the great wall.         Players who have reached level 80 also get new lands to explore and dungeons to conquer. These areas look as fertile as those in the Gateway and are populated by numerous factions that make up a web of adversarial philosophies. The death-worshipping Brittle Blade is a band of rogues that value chaos and a clean kill; the opposing Shadows of Jade want order restored so they can carry out their thievery in relative peace. To access faction-specific rewards, you perform duties for their leaders to enhance your standing with the group--but you also draw the ire of the opposing faction by doing so. These rewards might be as simple as great-looking armor, but two of these factions feature quest lines in which you can earn a wolf or tiger mount. The faction system is solid, and in some cases, eloquent character dialogue may get you caught up in the doctrines and faiths that drive these sects. But there's a notable downside to this new content: tedium. You grind repeatable quests ad nauseam until you've risen in stature enough to move to the next set of quests or earn the reward you crave. Chasing down a bunch of escaping prisoners or slicing your way through enemies so you can blow up a bridge is fun the first time. After you've done these missions 10 times, you'll long for more variety and wonder how the populace manages to rebuild that bridge so quickly, over and over again.      Luckily, a lot of these high-level quests are excellent, and many are highly challenging, even when you group with experienced players. Chopping up wolves and taming a motherless cub is simple enough; taking on a giant golem by stabbing at his feet requires a bit more manpower. The best experiences come by way of Rise of the Godslayer's mostly excellent dungeons. The six-man Kang Pagoda dungeon serves as a great introduction to the expansion's challenging delights. The disgusting boss within spews vomit and emits gas, and it's not a simple encounter by any stretch. There are still large-scale encounters, but there's a clear focus on the smaller ones, which means it might take you a lot of time repeating dungeons so you can afford the fancy faction armor you've been eyeing. Fortunately, grouping up and questing in the open world is still fun, thanks to Age of Conan's still-excellent combat, which requires you to stay focused on the proper key presses, lest you waste a good combo. Nothing beats whaling on a crowd of Craterspawn with a friend or two. It's just a pity that the slow pace at which you gain tangible rewards may dampen the spirits of even the most bloodthirsty adventurers.         Unusually, Funcom did not increase the level cap in Rise of the Godslayer but rather instituted a clever alternate advancement system. This is a supplementary tree in which you spend points earned in player-versus-environment and player-versus-player combat on both passive and active enhancements. And if you aren't playing as often as your guildmates, you can choose instead to unlock these feats and perks in real time, a la EVE Online. The trick is that you can only have so many of these enhancements active at once. The limited slots may remind you of the similar setup in Guild Wars, though Age of Conan's system, while flexible, doesn't feature Guild Wars' extreme adaptability. Nevertheless, it's an intriguing way of letting players adapt their characters as they further flesh out their roles in the world (and in their guilds). Just be prepared: It takes a lot of time to earn just one feat. You may initially lament the kind of investment the system requires for you to get the most out of it, but if you're in for the long haul, the perks are a fair reward for your time.       Age of Conan seems to have left behind the majority of its technical woes, though we did encounter various glitches, most of them relatively minor. Getting caught in an inescapable crevasse is an annoyance but is normally an easy fix with the /stuck command. On two occasions, however, we had our mount remain underneath our avatar even after dismissing it, which resulted in a hysterical sequence in which the character ran not along the ground but along the horse's back. (Logging out and logging back in was the only cure for this particular bug.) Fortunately, Rise of the Godslayer is a stable expansion, which means you can enjoy its solid quests and idyllic environs without many technical struggles. And these new areas are well worth investigating, whether you've traversed Kylikki's Crypt a few dozen times or have never so much as heard of the Fields of the Dead. And if stability issues and early content gaps caused you to turn away from the original Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer is a great reason to revisit this blood-soaked world.    "
337,Miitopia,5.0,1,"When I reviewed Miitopia on 3DS in 2017, I wasn’t terribly impressed. The game was dull, simplistic, and felt so random that I barely felt like I was playing it. But, as we’ve learned over the years, games can be improved significantly from their initial launches, and I figured that a Switch remake of Miitopia would be the perfect opportunity for Nintendo to fix the flaws of the 3DS release. Unfortunately, while there are notable improvements, the core game is still the same tiresome, repetitive experience from four years ago.Miitopia is a game where you take created Mii characters--based on yourself, friends and family, celebrities, fantasy characters, whoever--and “cast” them as player and NPC characters in a simple RPG story. The Dark Lord of Miitopia is ruining the peace and stealing the faces of the populace, so it’s up to you and your merry band of adventurers to gear up and put a stop to his wickedness, with plenty of goofy character interactions and dialogue snippets along the way.It’s a cute and fun concept, and to Miitopia’s credit, the Switch version of the game features a fully revamped character creator that lets you go all-out with creating incredibly detailed Mii characters by layering different hair, eyes, facial features, and additional shapes. It takes time to make a really impressive Mii, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, you can make some astounding creations. If you don’t have that sort of time, you can use Miis made by other players by entering their Access Code or pick from a selection of currently popular Miis. It’s a bit cumbersome not being able to search in-game for specific characters (it took me far too long to find a good Hank Hill) but with some online sleuthing on social media you should be able to find some good created-character libraries.Once you’ve got a bunch of Miis assigned to various roles, it’s time to set off on the adventure. You meet the Dark Lord, get told you’re the chosen hero, and quickly start to amass a party to vanquish evil from the land. The visuals and overall tone of the dialogue set up Miitopia as a tongue-in-cheek, comedic take on RPG tropes, and it succeeds pretty well on this front: it’s pleasant to look at, has lots of cute animations and bright colors, and the snappy, quip-laden dialogue is of the high quality we’ve come to expect from first-party Nintendo titles. The visual overhaul for the Switch version is excellent, adding more detail and flourishes without losing the simplistic charm of the original 3DS graphics.Sadly, all of that charm begins to melt away once you start digging into the actual gameplay. Miitopia’s combat and exploration are simplistic to a fault. Exploration consists of auto-running through an area and, occasionally, making a choice to follow a path or examine an object like a treasure chest. When you encounter enemies, you’ll be thrust into a turn-based battle… where almost all choice of what to do in combat is stripped from you. Instead, your party members, besides your main character,, are CPU-controlled. You can’t even give them general instructions like “attack the same enemy” or “focus on spells’, they just do what they want, often wasting resources and letting their “wacky” personality quirks take center stage instead of dispatching foes efficiently. As a result, you spend more time passively watching fights and exploration happen than actually doing anything, and no amount of cute dialogue can make up for the fact that your high-damage mage just wasted a turn sleeping--again. A new addition to Switch Miitopia’s combat is a horse who will sometimes let you ride it and do special attacks, but only sometimes. Like much of the game, it’s frustratingly random.But perhaps you’re not here for an in-depth RPG experience. Maybe you just want to watch all of your cute little Mii creations have silly dialogue exchanges while traveling and fighting and getting all friendly when they room with each other. That’s perfectly fine. The problem is the character-interaction element of the game isn’t all that great either. You encounter inns frequently when exploring, and by putting characters in the same rooms together, you can build their relationships. Better relationships let them learn new combat skills and help each other out in fights. You can also use tickets earned from treasure chests and enemy drops to go on ""outings"" with chosen characters to places like the beach, the movies, and karaoke, where you’ll see a short skit and watch their closeness levels rise. However, many of these skits and dialogue bits begin to repeat, quickly lessening their appeal. You can also choose to feed your party members and send them on shopping expeditions, which, again, are subject to frustrating random factors: You don’t know if characters will like food until they eat it (dislikes equal lesser stat gains), and sometimes when characters go shopping, they won’t buy the thing they intended to.Ultimately, beyond character-making and very base-level decisions, what happens in Miitopia feels completely out of your control, and what you can control ultimately feels simplistic and unfulfilling. So when the dialogue and character interactions start to wear thin, you wind up with an RPG that becomes quite dull after just a few hours. And Miitopia does little to add challenge or variety to this very basic formula as the game progresses, other than simply regressing you back to Level 1 with a new class and making you re-recruit party members at certain story points. What’s particularly frustrating is that these were all issues with the original 3DS game that could have been addressed in the Switch remake.Miitopia winds up being little more than a great character creator attached to an overly simple game that, while charming in its visuals and dialogue, is a mostly passive experience. Watching you recreate your favorite fictional character ships in-game or fighting Evil Guy Fieri has some brief appeal, but once those initial chuckles fade, Miitopia is disappointingly shallow. I’m sure there’s a great RPG yet to be made where you can team up with Mr. T, Goku, and Troy McClure to battle evil, but Miitopia is not that game."
1790,This War of Mine,8.0,2,"The Last of Us where someone was somehow clear-headed enough in the middle of a war zone to scrawl ""What happens when the food runs out?"" on a concrete wall on a backed-up highway. It's a meaningless bit of background detail there. Here, it’s an all-consuming, panic attack-inducing source of primal fear. Spec Ops: The Line, which aims to measure the toll on the people fighting a war for too long, it's not a question you need to address, because there's only one way you can ever interact with the people in front of your gun. When the soldiers are miles away, when the smoke clears, and every home harbors the ghosts of innocent bystanders, how long do you have before basic humanity is nothing but background noise compared to the constant roar of a hungry belly? My own answer to that question came about 12 days into This War of Mine. All legitimate avenues for obtaining foodstuffs--through barter, scavenging bombed-out ruins, trapping animals--had been exhausted. Our only weapons are a crowbar and a knife, which I left with the person whom I told to stand guard overnight at home. The only option that didn't involve surely taking a bullet involved entering a relatively untouched suburb. There was no security, but you're told there's plenty of food and supplies there… provided you're willing to steal them. With no other viable alternatives, I went. An old man opened the door, telling me his wife is sick, and they cannot share. He stood there, chastising my silent character. And I then had to weigh my group's survival versus terrorizing an old couple's home. Four hours later, I returned home with enough supplies to eat for a week straight. A week and a half later, my scavenger still hadn’t forgiven himself. Remorse is actually a tangible, ugly thing to visit upon the survivors in This War of Mine. Remorse causes characters to move slower, hang their heads, decide not to perform simple tasks due to the pointlessness of it all. Your friends at home may feel overwhelming guilt about using stolen goods. And left unchecked, such guilt can fester into crippling depression and, worse, lead to suicide. And it's one of the more gut-wrenching ways your little settlement can fall to pieces--though there are also far more obvious ways. like getting shot, stabbed, beaten, and, of course, starving to death. Your job, as player, is to fight the good fight, but not against military bullets and bombs, or an invading army; you instead have to maintain everything else that's left in the ashes of their wake. The Sims, rendered in a beautiful, but portentous, constantly moving pencil art style. You start with three survivors who have taken shelter in a dilapidated three-story house: two childhood friends, and a displaced TV chef who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The game doesn't give you a tutorial on how to use anything, but it's simple enough to suss out after only a few minutes. By day, food and shelter must be meticulously prepared, and the convenient tools of modern living we all take for granted are now scarce or need to be built completely from scratch. By night, new supplies must be scavenged from the surrounding areas while you pray no one had the same idea about looting your place. Thankfully, the game doesn't go for complete realism, i.e. you never have to wonder why an ex-football player knows how to build a full kitchen range out of a box of random crap and a wooden plank. Your supplies are kept under simple headings like ""electronics,"" ""fuel,"" and ""parts,"" and as long as you have enough of them, you can run to your workbench and craft anything you need at will, from creature comforts like chairs and beds, to simple survival tools like small animal traps and rainwater collectors; you can also do more complex stuff like fixing broken guns and armor. The trick, of course, is actually having the resources or even the energy for any of that. When you start the game, all of your survivors are starving, one is wounded, and one is sick. Tending to them is the top priority, so you have to scrounge around the house first for enough materials to build beds, or find food, or build a crude stove. But what if you run out of materials early? Who gets to sleep in a bed instead of on the floor? Who gets to eat tonight? Is someone sick or wounded enough to warrant spending the resources on meds instead of a shovel to dig out debris? Later on, this gives way to bigger concerns, such as whether your housemates harbor resentment for something you did while scavenging the previous night, or whether they’ll sink into depression due to scraping by on raw food, with no distractions or simple pleasures like books, coffee, moonshine, or cigarettes. How is a character going to react if you have to burn the last book in the house to heat the place for another night? And so, you scavenge. You can visit a single location every night, with a helpful screen telling you the current situation around the place, rumors you've heard, and what could be contained inside, and you can then search around for anything that might be of use. Some nights, especially early on, you get lucky, and the chosen location is completely abandoned, meaning you can take your time, keep tabs on what your house needs, and walk away with enough food and supplies for a few days, as well as enough resources to make serious improvements. And then come the times when you run into other people. Interactions with other people can go all sorts of ways here. My first encounter with another person was at a supermarket--a gun-wielding man with a bandana over his face, telling his people what to look for. When he turns and sees me, there's a moment of dread where I don't know how, or even if, I should take a swing before he pulls the trigger. To my complete relief, he says there's plenty for everyone, and to feel free to explore. He and his people completely leave me to my own devices the whole night. There are occasional surprises like this in This War of Mine, where your faith in other people is rewarded. People remember when you're good to them, and come to your aid when you least expect it. People randomly share what they have if you do the same. More than once, a couple living a few doors down came by with vegetables right when things were looking their darkest, thanks to sending someone to help clear the debris in their home a few days before. But of course, there's the other side of things. Late in my first playthrough, I happened upon a woman trying to barter for supplies from a soldier, who ends up asking for sexual favors in return. Unfortunately, the game's simple nature gets in the way, here. There's no way to knock, or sneak up behind someone, or even grab a chunk of rock to throw. So, when it becomes obvious this isn't going to go well, I barge in, crowbar in hand. I'm promptly shot dead for my efforts. It's that moment that tended to define my interactions with people afterward. If I'm desperate enough to steal, I'm desperate enough to shoot/strike first and ask no questions later. New survivors would come to my door, asking for a place to stay, and for a while, I kept wondering if they were dangerous and, more importantly, did I really have the ability to support another hungry mouth? In playthroughs that reached later in the month, the answer was increasingly, heartbreakingly ""no."" Even when the answer was “yes,” at times when my house legitimately flourished without the need to harm another soul--as much as it could flourish anyway--the biggest problem then came down to sheer boredom. The tedium of living day by day, carefully scraping for supplies, creating a house routine, listening to the radio and praying for a booming ""THE WAR IS OVER!"" announcement that never comes, it starts to bear down on you more than even seeing housemates get attacked or killed. Even in relative prosperity, you're still stuck in this place every day in a non-stop holding pattern, until, indeed, the food runs out. And that's perhaps the ultimate point of This War of Mine: It doesn't stop. Survival when you're so disconnected from the things that right now make us full, happy, and human is monotonous. It's boring, and sad, and ongoing. For my part, I had a constant vision in my head that the events of a random Call of Duty were taking place just beyond the northern reaches of the map, and despite having that constantly in mind, in the moment, how many terrorists were being eliminated with extreme prejudice didn't matter. A helicopter rescue was always going to be there for those guys, taking them back to home base. There's no such rescue coming for my survivors. The achievements, and dudebro camaraderie seemed especially silly then, when I hadn’t been able to provide a hot meal for someone in three days and he was rocking himself to sleep in a corner because his best friend got shot last night, all because we needed to build someone a heater for when it got cold. Is this a game you want to play? No. Is it a game anyone with a beating heart should play? Yes. A million times yes. It's a longform exercise in empathy, a sobering piece of work that fills in the blanks left when all we see of war are the headshots. It's a much-needed course correct in the current shoot-first-ask-questions-never gaming landscape that supposes war is won because one supreme badguy caught a bullet through his brainstem. No: It's won when the people who lived under his boot get to go home."
2770,Saints Row: The Third,5.0,1,"Saints Row: The Third, brings four new activity types to the smorgasbord of mayhem and violence that is Steelport. Unfortunately, only one of these new pursuits measures up to the inspired zaniness typified by the activities included in the original game. Genki Bowl VII is a slight piece of downloadable content that mostly feels downright mundane compared to everything that came before.        Professor Genki, the homicidal man-cat whose Super Ethical Reality Climax competitions are a staple of the Steelport entertainment scene, ups the ante once a year, devising deadly new contests for a select group of proven warriors. As the leader of the Saints, you're given the opportunity to enter this annual tournament and prove yourself worthy of being crowned Genki Bowl champion.     Story is a minor part of this escapade, and laughs are in short supply. There are a few cutscenes in which returning commentators Zach and Bobby set up the events you're about to participate in, but the main game's hilarious scenes featuring your customized character engaging in the business of ruling a gang while naked and speaking in a zombie voice (or sporting whatever absurd characteristics you've selected for him or her) are sadly absent. Without these spirited interludes and the humor they inject into the proceedings, the events of Genki Bowl VII feel a bit lifeless and isolated from the rest of your character's adventures in Steelport.     Your participation in Genki Bowl VII begins with an event called Genki Apocalypse. In Genki Apocalypse, you're tossed into a booby-trapped, mascot-infested gauntlet, in which you must kill your enemies and make your way to the exit alive. If you think this sounds an awful lot like the Super Ethical Reality Climax events you've already played, you're not wrong. The only things that differentiate Genki Apocalypse from SERC are the amusingly cheap jungle set dressings that decorate the obstacle courses, and the shark-infested pools and streams within them. The first time you see a mascot wander into water and instantly get devoured by a great white, it's a delightful surprise that's perfectly in keeping with the cartoonish carnage that helps make Saints Row: The Third so exciting.         But as amusing as this little touch is, it can't keep Genki Apocalypse from feeling like more of something we got plenty of already. And the two instances of Genki Apocalypse don't even measure up to the better SERC events. The Genki Apocalypse layouts are a bit labyrinthine, and although Saints Row: The Third manages to make a surprisingly wide range of activities enjoyable, maze navigation isn't one of them. Failing an event not because you were shot one too many times by a guy in an energy drink costume but because you failed to find the exit before time ran out is no way for a Saint to go down.     After completing your first Genki Apocalypse event, you're invited to take advantage of a Super Ethical PR Opportunity. Here, you must drive the psychopathic professor himself to a public appearance. Professor Genki's ride, the Genki Mobile, is especially effective at mowing down pedestrians, and it sports flamethrowers on the front and sides. These features come in handy, because Genki is a demanding passenger. In addition to keeping him away from the overzealous fans who try to swarm around you, you must appease him by causing a tremendous amount of death and destruction before delivering him to his destination.       So you cruise down sidewalks to off pedestrians--something you've probably done plenty of just for the fun of it already--and occasionally do something specific at Genki's behest, like cause a certain amount of damage to other cars, or kill some mascots who are cruising around on carts. It's a messy and chaotic event, but it lacks the spark of creativity that characterizes the best activities in Saints Row and doesn't feel all that different from a typical drive about town. Speeding down sidewalks to kill people and fill up Professor Genki's pleasure meter is commonplace by Steelport standards, and by the time Professor Genki has seen enough slaughter and is ready to be taken to his appearance, you're more than ready for the event to be over.      Next, it's time for the Sexy Kitten Yarngasm. This event puts you in control of a massive ball of yarn, called Yarnie, which you roll around the streets of Steelport, leaving destruction in your wake. To succeed, you must cause a certain amount of damage within a set amount of time. It's exactly like the Tank Mayhem events of Saints Row: The Third, only you crush vehicles by rolling over them with a huge sphere instead of blasting them with the tremendous firepower of a tank. For completing Sexy Kitten Yarngasm, you're awarded Yarnie as a vehicle, and it makes a humorous addition to your garage that you might enjoy taking for a spin once in a while just for the comic novelty of seeing a huge ball of yarn roll down the streets. But the event itself overstays its welcome. It's cathartic for a short while to roll over things and make them go boom, but that's all there is to Sexy Kitten Yarngasm; meeting your destructive goal isn't challenging in the least, so there's no sense of accomplishment to make that destruction rewarding.   Unfortunately, you need to jump through the hoops of those first three event types before competing in Genki Bowl's final, and best, offering. In Sad Panda Skyblazing, you leap out of a plane and hurl through the air, trying to make your way through the floating rings that mark your route to the finish. Doing so isn't easy, nor should it be. It takes practice and finesse to get the hang of staying on course. Should you lose too much altitude to pass through the rings as you're heading for the finish line, you can dive into one of the many huge balloons below, bouncing off of it and getting the lift you need.    Just hitting your mark is challenging and exciting in itself, but it isn't enough to succeed. As you speed through the sky, you also need to keep an eye on the rooftops far below for mobs of mascots. To earn enough money to win the event, you must also plummet onto some of these spots and slice those mascots to bits with a chainsaw before entering one of the launchers placed on the rooftops and being fired back on your way toward the goal. The entire event has just the sort of precarious, death-defying flavor that characterizes so many standout moments of Saints Row: The Third, and its two instances provide an exhilarating coda to Genki Bowl VII.      As enjoyable as it is, though, Sad Panda Skyblazing can't make the entirety of Genki Bowl VII worthwhile. The add-on's eight events--two instances of each of the four types--can be completed in under an hour if you successfully finish each one on your first try, and six of those eight events feel like something you're obligated to complete to get to the good stuff. It's included as part of the season pass content, but purchased separately, it's $6.99, and it's much too insubstantial to justify that cost. Sure, you earn a few new homies and some new vehicles for your trouble--including that huge, amusing ball of yarn--but this downloadable content just doesn't possess the sense of constantly surprising, outrageous fun that made Saints Row: The Third so incredible.  "
1385,Hyper Light Drifter,9.0,2,"It is more than simply pretty; Hyper Light Drifter uses its visuals to both guide and relax you. The grandest vistas calm your pulse between difficult, breathless combat sequences. Developer Heart Machine applies to its visuals a lesson music composers learn early in their studies: rests are as important as notes. Heart Machine uses the number of notes required, no fewer and no more; during the rests, you explore the world, looking for secrets and valuable health packs. You take in sights such as a colossal mechanical hand--iced over, disembodied--and wonder about the titan it belonged to. You speak to citizens, who warble at you unintelligibly and warn you of danger with simple graphical speech bubbles. In each of the game's regions, the color palette grows more complex. Yellows and soft pinks turn to rich greens and mauves, and even later, deep purples. Few games use color so well, with its sandy browns and blistering oranges depicting the blazing desert heat.Visual and narrative mysteries translate to structural ones, too. Aside from some plain-text coaching, Hyper Light Drifter largely uses its own wordless language to lead you. Its structure is simple once you learn: you travel to each of the game's four primary regions to fight bosses and ultimately unlock the final area, collecting objects that serve as currency and returning to your home village to upgrade skills and weapons along the way. Combat arenas and environmental dangers are the primary obstacles in your path, and they prove formidable ones, particularly when you must contend with both at once.The simple creatures that first drop in to harass you provide little challenge, but they help accustom you to your fluid melee attacks and the way those attacks charge your guns. These early hours are also the time to master the slick dashes known as drifting. Eventually, you can string together an infinite number of drifts, but the timing can be elusive. (I know of players performing chains of an awe-inspiring 1,000 drifts in the village's practice arena.) With these tools, you face magic-wielding vultures, crystalline spiders, and vicious gunners, and taking down a mass of them within a confined space can be a Herculean labor.You are not Hercules but Hermes, quick and cunning, moving in when opportunity strikes, and dashing away.Yet just as the exploration and visuals follow a satisfying and varied rhythm, so too do individual battles. With each drift, you leave a series of brief afterimages in your wake, which makes the mechanic inherently enjoyable. When you slip around and between projectiles and attack dogs, drifting is even sweeter. You are not Hercules but Hermes, quick and cunning, moving in when opportunity strikes, and dashing away. Amidst the chaos, automated turrets rise from the ground and fleet-footed ninjas fling shuriken at you from disconnected platforms. You drift to the turret controls and shut them down, then across empty space to the ninja, taking him down in a few swipes of your sword. You do all this in the space of a second or two, calculating the right trajectories and timings on the fly, and hoping you get the math right--or at least, close enough to stay alive. It's not like there are health packs raining from heaven, and you can only hold so many.These battles are fluid, demanding, and--usually--fair. Hyper Light Drifter's primary drawback is, ironically, found in the same visuals that make it such a vibrant success. Its pixel art is a wonder, but the depiction of 3D space isn't always crystal clear. You might get stuck behind a simple object in the overly cluttered spaces, or hemmed in during the busiest battles. Even outside of battle, you might wander behind some trees or buildings looking for secret areas and hidden objects, only to fall off a ledge that's hidden from view.It’s only because Hyper Light Drifter is so masterful that its rare blips stand out at all.It’s only because Hyper Light Drifter is so masterful that its rare blips stand out at all. Consider the boss battles, which require a measure of skill, particularly if you only have one or two health packs on hand. Avoiding trouble doesn't just mean drifting away, but drifting into a position that makes your next drift or next attack successful. More calculations, more measurements, always staying two or three steps ahead. Consider the audio, too, particularly the chiptune soundtrack, which gets your attention with deep rumbles and a simple two-note motif, then allows tension to build in its silences.Lastly, consider how enjoyable it is to navigate Hyper Light Drifter's spaces--the networks of elevators and shimmering force-fields that lead to more discoveries, more hidden regions, and more locked doors begging to be opened. I vanquished the final boss after six or seven hours, but I'm still exploring, hoping to find every last crevice, every opening I've missed, every invisible platform. There are untold stories lurking out there. And once I have uncovered them, I hope Hyper Light Drifter's community has multitudes more to share."
869,We Happy Few,4.0,0,"Just like the forcibly stretched grins of its inhabitants, the joy found in We Happy Few is a facade. The game's fascinating setting of a drug-fueled society wasting away in fake happiness is squandered on repetitive environments, poorly paced and downright boring quest designs, and a variety of confusing mechanics that never find harmony with each other. Its three individual tales of survival manage to deliver some surprisingly poignant moments, but We Happy Few does its best to dissuade you from wanting to play long enough to see them through.We Happy Few takes place in a timeline where Germany reigned victorious after World War II and has England bowing to their whims. Children are sent to the German mainland without reason, and the quiet town of Wellington Wells is plunged into a drug-induced mirage of peaceful, happy co-existence. With pills called ""Joy"" helping citizens forget the atrocities of the past, uprising is far less likely. But this fake sense of tranquility brings about its own problems. Citizens refusing to live under Joy's medicinal spell are outcast to the borders of city, forced to live in decrepit, crumbling houses while they wait to starve to death. The citizens of Wellington Wells are always happy to see you, but only if you abide by their rules.Enter Arthur, Sally and Ollie--the three characters you'll control throughout three acts that show all sides of this horrific society. Arthur suffers from post-traumatic stress, reliving the moments where he lost his brother to the German kidnappings. Sally hides a secret within the walls of Wellington Wells while also providing black market drugs to those who pay enough. Ollie is just a confused war veteran, disturbed by events of the past that have shaped his future. The more personal aspects of each character end up being more interesting than the mythos surrounding them. Each new perspective lends context to previously puzzling interactions to create clever ""aha"" moments, and the stories have powerful themes of abandonment, parental sacrifice, and overbearing guilt. Each finds a satisfying (if not always happy) end to their journey, despite the mechanics fighting actively against you reaching their climax.In Early Access (where the game sat for nearly two years), We Happy Few was a survival game. That's mostly stayed the same, despite the structure of its design changing around it. As any character, you'll need to manage meters for hunger, thirst, tiredness, and more (Ollie actually needs to watch his blood sugar, of all things), which impose penalties and buffs on your fighting and movement abilities. Early on, managing these statuses is difficult, with a scarcity of resources while you're still coming to grips with We Happy Few's many rules. But they soon end up being just frustrating. The resources to replenish them aren't hard to find, but constantly having to tend to them when you're just wanting to get along with the story is arduous.There is an unbelievable number of items to pick up and carry in We Happy Few, but only a small handful end up being useful. You’ll frequently be forced to pick up flowers to craft healing balms or bobby pins for lockpicks, for example. But vials of toxins that can knock out or kill enemies don't give you a reason to choose one or the other. The crafting menus for each character change based on their abilities, but the core items that are shared between all three are likely the only ones you'll actually utilize--the specialized items hardly necessitate their complex requirements. It feels like such a waste having a vast crafting system attached to a game that never puts you in a situation where it feels necessary. We Happy Few has many ideas strewn across its menus but nothing mechanically that requires their use.This frustration is only exacerbated by the lack of interesting quests to undertake in We Happy Few's relatively large open world. Its inhabitants treat you as their delivery boy, never giving you anything more complex than walking to an area, picking something up, and walking all the way back. Quest design works counterintuitively to the idea of having to scrounge to survive. Even if you wanted to reach into the world's nooks and crannies to find something interesting, inquisitive eyes are rarely met with any rewards aside from the plethora of items you probably already have stashed in your inventory. There's a point in Arthur's story where he exclaims, after a multi-staged questline, ""All that, just to reboot a bridge?"" and it feels like he's crying out for help from you directly.What attempts to break up this straightforward structure are the rules of Wellington Wells. Outside of its walls you'll be forced to don tattered clothing to fit in with the rest of the depressing crowd, as well as fighting off temptations to steal from their strewn-about dwellings. Inside is another story entirely. The inhabitants of Joy-infested cities will be quick to throw up arms should you do anything but walk. Haunting guards and eerie Joy-sniffing doctors pose a threat to your blending in, which can force you to pop some pills from time to time. Their effects keep you hidden for a time but have devastating withdrawal symptoms that prevent you from masking your depression, which can have an entire city on your tail in mere seconds.The setting sounds intriguing on paper: a system where stealth is managed by social interactions and conformity. But its execution is lacking. Obeying the strictly imposed rules is trivial and only slows down your progress towards the next quest marker, negating any sense of tension they might have imposed. Outside, the rules are looser, but there's also far less to look at. You'll spend a lot of time simply sprinting through empty fields with no discernable landmarks, only to be greeted by another bridge into another strict state that brings progress to a crawl. It's a disappointing misuse of a system that might have otherwise been engrossing.It feels like We Happy Few understands many of its mechanics are a chore to begin with.The character progression system is even more underdeveloped. While each of the three characters has some unique characteristics, the abilities you're able to purchase are largely shared between them, and many give you ways to turn some of We Happy Few's rules off entirely. One allows you to sprint through cities without rousing alarm for example, while another lets you ignore annoying night curfews entirely. It feels like a concession--like We Happy Few understands many of its mechanics are a chore to begin with.When rules aren't being (mercifully) stripped away, they often just don't work. The night curfew, for example, will have guards turn hostile should they spot you. But conceal yourself on a bench, and they inexplicably ignore you entirely. Melee combat is monotone and predictably boils down to you exhausting your stamina swinging your weapon and then simply blocking until it recharges. When you're not being forced to contend with that, you'll be sneaking around enemies with a barely functioning stealth system. Enemies are inconsistent in their ability to spot you, sometimes walking across your path without a whiff of suspicion. Their patrol lines are easy to spot and never deviate, making the reward of a successful infiltration feel remarkably hollow. Most times they're just far too predictable. They'll stare for extended periods at distractions you conjure and fail to search an area after spotting you briefly. We Happy Few's stealth is so transparently binary that it just feels like you're cheating the system most of the time.It's a shame that so many of these systems never fit together in a cohesive way, especially when the world itself is overflowing with potential. There's some rich environmental storytelling in We Happy Few, even if its visual variety is shallow. It's striking to transition from dilapidated walls with mad ravings written across them to neatly structured hollows parallel with rainbow roads. The way We Happy Few mixes up its visual representation based on your character's mental states is clever, too. On Joy you'll witness double rainbows as far as the eye can see, with a shiny veneer encapsulating the overly cheery nature of your character. Withdrawal sours this into a dreary grey world where the sounds of flies and visions of decay replace usually unremarkable facets of the environment.This blends well with We Happy Few's interpretation of the era. Monochrome television screens hang from awnings and play the propaganda-filled ravings of the enigmatic Uncle Jack swing towards you as you pass with a startling red hue. The stretched faces of Wellington Wells' most behaved citizens are off-putting in a brilliantly creepy way, even if there's such a lack of distinct character models that you'll find multiple identical faces hanging out on a single street corner. Cartoonish robotic contraptions mingle in more strictly secure areas and whistle off cheery tunes as they pass by. They also tend to mess about with the pathfinding for Wellington's human inhabitants, which is hilarious only the first few times. For everything that We Happy Few gets right in terms of world building, its gameplay leads it astray.For everything that We Happy Few gets right in terms of world building, its gameplay leads it astray.Technical issues plague We Happy Few too, ranging from mildly annoying to borderline game-breaking. Characters will often clip through the floor or disappear entirely as you approach. Shifts between night and day see characters appear and disappear from one second to the next. The framerate suffers on capable PC hardware. Quest logs will sometimes not refresh, while getting an item at the wrong time failed to trigger a quest milestone, forcing me to reload an older save. Audio can disappear from cutscenes entirely for long stretches of time. From numerous angles, We Happy Few is in rough shape.But even if you are able to overlook its technical shortcomings or perhaps wait for more stable patches in the future, We Happy Few's biggest problems are ones that are hard to remedy. Its entire gameplay loop is underpinned by boring quests and long stretches of inaction. And even when it forces you to interact with its world beyond just walking to waypoints, combat, stealth, and otherwise fascinating societies fail to impose the right balance of challenge and tension. There's a clear lack of direction that We Happy Few is never able to shake, which wastes its intriguing setting. It does manage to weave each of its three stories cohesively into a larger tale, but it's also one that's never critical enough to earn the right to repeat ""happiness is a choice"" any chance it can. There are just too many hurdles to overcome to enjoy We Happy Few, and not enough Joy in the world to cast them aside."
4555,Mega Man Legends,4.0,0," Mega Man Legends is an unembellished port of a forgettable 3-year-old PlayStation game. If you're a big Mega Man fan, chances are you own a PlayStation and, therefore, have no compelling reason to buy Mega Man Legends for the PC. Those who aren't familiar with Capcom's Mega Man series can also skip this game, because it's very old and not especially fun for the 35 long hours it takes to finish. In closing, while there are still many issues that divide us, this is not one of them. Thank you and good night.   To match the amount of effort Capcom put into the port, that's really where the review should end. Unfortunately, although there isn't too much more to say about Mega Man Legends, the review must continue. All the previous Mega Man games have been side-scrolling shooters. Legends, however, attempts to expand the series by being a 3D action/role-playing hybrid in the spirit of Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo 64. It tells the story of Mega Man, his sister Roll, his grandfather, and their pet monkey. They crash-land their airship on an island called Kattelox. While trying to repair the ship, they become embroiled in an effort to save the island from attackers. Ultimately, they end up learning a lot about the origins of Mega Man and a few valuable lessons about the power of friendship and getting bigger guns attached to your robot arm.   In the strict tradition of these types of games, you walk around sections of the environment and talk to everyone until somebody finally tells you what to do next. After you do it, a new area might open up, though you may have to talk to a few more people and complete a few more tasks first. In between, you can purchase new items for Mega Man at various shops. As in most console role-playing games, there is a dog that says ""woof"" when you try to talk to it, and many people have lost things.   The ""action"" part of ""action/role-playing hybrid"" refers to the combat system. Enemies attack in simple patterns, and you have to shoot them. Many of these battles take place in underground tunnel areas in which the control scheme makes aiming difficult. Instead of adjusting the controls to take advantage of the PC mouse, the game utilizes a cumbersome system whereby you use a gamepad's shoulder buttons to turn. In fact--even though you shouldn't bother anyway--if you don't have a gamepad, you really shouldn't bother with Mega Man Legends. Though there's a button that supposedly locks your aim on to enemies, it doesn't work very well, as the lock is lost as soon as an enemy scoots off the screen.   The environments are colorful, and, though geometrically simple, they display a surprisingly deep view distance. Unsurprisingly, though, the graphics that weren't noteworthy in 1998 haven't gotten better with age. Three years and the migration from your forgiving television five feet away to a high-resolution monitor eight inches from your face have not been kind to Mega Man Legends' visuals, and the developers made no attempt to improve them.   The frequent cutscenes are integrated seamlessly into the game, since they're rendered using the engine. Unfortunately, either something went wrong with these scenes during the conversion to the PC, or they never worked right in the first place, because the dialogue is completely decoupled from the graphics. You'll see one character begin talking while the voice of another character is still playing on the soundtrack. At first it's confusing, but eventually it becomes sort of ineptly charming. So you can consider that something positive about the game.   Mega Man Legends is a product for people who want a little action with their adventure or a little adventure with their action, but not too much of both--or either one, for that matter. It also represents the worst type of publisher shovelware. No attempt has been made to improve it any way for the PC, and it shows. Many much, much better games exist in the same genre. In fact, Capcom has subsequently released both a prequel and a sequel for the PlayStation. And you can play all of them right now on your PC using Bleem.    	  "
2516,Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,6.0,1,"Naughty Bear, you're not alone. If anything, his comeback in Panic in Paradise comes as a greater surprise to his legion of fluffy companions, who made the woeful mistake of booking a trip to Paradise Island without inviting Naughty--for what may be obvious reasons. The story never gets any more complex than that, and with that simple premise out of the way, it's not long before Naughty is up to his old tricks, such as ramming the nozzle from a gasoline pump down the throat of one of his cuddly friends and then flicking a burning match on him. Panic in Paradise makes strides toward being more appealing than its forebear, but it ultimately offers more of the same.        Each level still involves stalking ursine bystanders and subjecting them to cruelly detailed punishments with weapons and environmental perils like bamboo sticks. Panic in Paradise aims to enhance the experience with an emphasis on costumes, similar to the Hitman series. Not only do you have the option to sneak up on unsuspecting bears and bash their stuffing out as before, but you can also drag them into nearby woods and steal their duds. It's a smart move that adds some much-needed variety, both in the way specific costumes let you get close to targets without being noticed and the way you can unlock them for further use after completing a level.     Buying costumes piece by piece with the gold you've accumulated from your sprees now determines how quickly you level up. Each costume piece for the slots available for Naughty's head, face, torso, arms, and feet levels separately, and thus you need to switch out maxed items if you want to continue leveling up. The costumes are worthwhile investments in themselves since some grant massive boosts to Naughty's stats, allowing him to withstand a few more hits when his target is surrounded by bears. Naughty's vastly improved arsenal benefits from this system as well, although it's disappointing that many of the weapons use the same animations despite their differing textures. All this takes place in a much larger world than we saw before, complete with a vastly improved camera and 36 new bears to torture spread across 11 separate levels that should last well over 15 hours for completionists.           But even with the additions, this gameplay gets painfully old after a couple of hours. Behavior Interactive put forth some clear effort to avoid this criticism by including varied settings, such as power plants and laboratories, along with requirements to kill bears while wielding specific weapons or wearing specific costumes, but inevitably every level falls into the same tired pattern of sneaking through bushes, trashing the scenery, stealing costumes, and braining the few bears who refuse to approach your hiding place.      At times the objectives aren't even clear, so you wander around wondering if you've picked up the right weapon or if you're staring at the object you're supposed to kill your main victim with. The action is made worse by the clunky melee combat that's a little too awkward without a target lock, and the mediocre graphics never achieve any greater significance than providing a sense of place for the action. All of these ingredients combine to make Panic in Paradise a game that's best played in short bursts rather than extended sessions.         Even then, Panic in Paradise suffers from an annoying tendency to crash at the most inopportune moments, such as when you've spent 30 minutes completing all the secondary objectives and nabbing every costume in one of the larger levels. After the crash, you have no choice but to start all over, which can be a pain since getting the most out of every level entails tackling at least three secondary objectives and bashing all the scenery for extra gold. If that's not bad enough, the bears themselves tend to die too soon, particularly if you accidentally spook them into committing suicide by running into the ubiquitous cacti when the level requires you to shove them into an interdimensional portal instead. Worst of all, Naughty sometimes gets stuck in his attack animations, and you're powerless until his deathblow decides to come down several minutes later.      Despite these stumbles, Panic in Paradise is still a better game than 2010's Naughty Bear in terms of content, but ultimately the same awareness of a hundred missed opportunities settles in. As before, the charm of the unhinged British narrator and the sight of cutesy bears getting impaled on bamboo wears off before long, and the new nods to variety can't mask the feeling that you're doing the same thing over and over for more than 30 levels. Still, restricting this meatier entry to a downloadable game at a fraction of the original's cost allows you to stretch your dollars, and the ability to revisit each level for higher scores and better costumes allows for substantial replayability--presuming you want to replay it in the first place. A word of warning to parents, though: Naughty is even more violent this time around, and while there's technically no blood or swearing, some of the sights are far more gruesome than its kid-friendly rating would have you believe.   "
998,Destiny 2,5.0,1,"If you simply ran out of things to do in vanilla Destiny 2, its first DLC expansion, Curse of Osiris, adds a few new activities for you to take on. It introduces a new setting in Mercury, a short campaign, new weapons and gear, Strikes, Crucible maps, Adventures, among smaller things. But aside from the brief but fun Raid Lair, the new stuff in Curse of Osiris doesn't add anything substantial or interesting to Destiny 2 to make it worth revisiting.Curse of Osiris picks up right after the end of the base game's campaign, as far as your level goes. You could go directly from the end of the Red War story to Curse of Osiris' campaign, which requires a power level of 200 to 220, without having to grind much in between. For newcomers or PC players who've had less time with the game, it's a comfortable bridge for leveling up between the lower-level vanilla content and the high-level endgame activities like the Nightfall. (Those endgame activities are a different story, but we'll get to that in a bit.)As a result, though, Curse of Osiris' story missions feel like filler. The campaign sets up an enormous undertaking against the Vex, with infinite timelines and computer simulations and the mysterious Warlock Osiris mixed up in it all. But with a two-or-so-hour runtime, the missions rush through the interesting concepts and usher you into a simple final battle that is essentially scripted. It's not enough time to fully understand Osiris as a character, which is disappointing considering he's only ever been mentioned in Destiny lore before now.The beautiful and varied Infinite Forest, a Vex creation designed to simulate timelines and their infinite permutations, is the most interesting addition in the expansion. Within the Forest, you can travel to a simulation of the past, a much more vibrant and lush version of Mercury that's stunning to look at. But even then, the story doesn't task you with exploring it or any other location in the Forest, instead shepherding you through areas to find codes and things that smarter NPCs can use to pinpoint your next destination for you. The lack of callbacks to Vault of Glass from Destiny 1, another time-bending Vex creation, is also a letdown.Other than the Infinite Forest, the new destination, Mercury, is simply uninteresting to explore. It's a small circular map with one new Public Event, a new vendor, and a handful of chests and Lost Sectors. The foundation of exploration established in the base game is still good here--having a variety of options to choose from does make things feel less repetitive--but it feels like busywork with little to do at the highest level. That extends to the new Strikes, which are almost direct copies of two of the story missions, nothing more than another way to kill time.The biggest problem with Curse of Osiris is that it locks certain high-level activities, including the Prestige Nightfall, behind its new power level cap. The recommended power for the Prestige Nightfall in particular is 330, which you can't reach if you don't have the Curse of Osiris DLC. So if you don't get the DLC, you suddenly don't have access to something you used to be able to do. It's also frustrating if you do get Curse of Osiris, because the higher level requirement doesn't fundamentally change these activities.New Heroic Adventures add Nightfall-style modifiers to the Adventures on Mercury, but those missions aren't begging to be replayed. The main incentive to do them at all is to unlock a Lost Prophecy quest from the NPC Brother Vance, which is one of most tedious fetch quests in all of Destiny 2. If you do manage to gather 10 of the necessary item (through repeating Public Events and finding chests), you unlock the Forge, where you can craft Legendary Vex weapons. But for anyone besides the most dedicated players, there's no compelling reason to do all this unless you want to redo old missions on harder difficulties in order to get loot to use when you do them again.While some of the new loot is worth collecting--my favorites so far include the Legendary automatic scout rifle Metronome-52 and the broken but ridiculously fun Prometheus Lens Exotic--you'll likely get a lot of duplicates before you get anything you actually want to use. Because the main reward for everything you do is shiny new loot, the frustratingly high drop rate of duplicates makes grinding more disappointing than satisfying. The gunplay feels as great as ever, though, so it can be fun to experiment with new weapons, but it's not enough to sustain an expansion that adds little outside of extra busywork.The excellent gunplay is not enough to sustain an expansion that adds little outside extra busywork.The Raid Lair, while shorter than a typical Destiny Raid, is the one late-game addition that's worth trying. Eater of Worlds is set on Leviathan, the setting of Destiny 2's first Raid, but with a different boss and separate areas to explore. It features a mix of Destiny-style puzzles, including a platforming sequence and fun with orbs, but in a less time-consuming package that's a welcome alternative to the full Leviathan Raid. Using careful teamwork to solve puzzles is rewarding in ways that the story and simple Strikes aren't, and combining that with the right loadout and strong shooting skills shows what Destiny can be when it leaves the filler behind and makes the most out of its best mechanics.But in almost every respect, Curse of Osiris doesn't elevate Destiny 2 beyond what it was at launch. Especially for lapsed players, the same old activities reskinned for an unremarkable new setting make them feel more like chores than ever, and the interesting ideas in the Infinite Forest aren't at all used to their potential. There's still some fun to be had in finding new weapons and maybe tackling the Raid Lair, but reaching that point is so tedious that it hardly feels worth doing.Editor's note: When we first published our Curse of Osiris review, both the Prestige Nightfall and the Prestige Raid were set at the 330 power requirement. In a recent post, Bungie revealed plans for a hotfix that will reduce the Prestige Raid requirement to 300, making it accessible to all players. The Prestige Nightfall will remain at 330. The review text has been updated to reflect this change. "
3504,LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4,8.0,2,"  If you're familiar with developer Traveller's Tales' previous Lego games, you might think you know what Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is like even before you've played it--and you'd be partially right. In this game, just as in Lego Star Wars and its ilk, you (perhaps along with a friend on the same console) experience a witty and wordless rendition of a famed tale, with your favorite characters replaced by blocky Lego re-creations. Yet central elements of the previous games, such as simplistic combat and floaty platforming, have been given a secondary role in Harry's story. Now, the focus is squarely on collecting all those countless Lego bits that go flying everywhere with almost every spell you cast. You're constantly showered with currency as you solve light puzzles and manipulate practically every object you see with your versatile wand. You still need to contend with a few of the series' lingering issues (unhelpful AI, slippery platforms) and a couple of minor new ones (iffy targeting, random bugs). But the scattered flaws aren't likely to dampen the joy of playing Lego Harry Potter, particularly if you're a fan of the source material.      Prisoner of Azkaban, which is super fun to play, but makes no sense within the context of the original story.      Such action sequences are rare in Lego Harry Potter, though there are still light combat sections and boss fights. You defeat Dementors by casting the Patronus Charm, fight Aragog by throwing spiders at him using Wingardium Leviosa, and even take on He Who Must Not Be Named. Most of the time, however, you're scouring the environment looking for ways to use your ever-increasing repertoire of spells. You can switch between spells easily and cast the one you prefer, and in certain cases, such as using Lumos to make vines wither away, you need to select the spell manually. However, most spells are contextual and can be cast by holding a button and hovering the spell cursor over the object you want to manipulate. Just be sure to plug in a controller or two; the fiddly keyboard controls aren't that friendly for either kids or adults. And even with a controller, the targeting can be a little iffy; sometimes the halo indicating an interactive object won't appear when it seems it should, and it's really easy to target something you don't intend to--such as an unsuspecting student. But this is a mostly insignificant inconvenience. For the most part, you'll be smashing everything that's smashable and reconstructing everything that's reconstructible, reaping the bits that scatter as a reward for charms well cast.        Between levels, you can head to Diagon Alley to spend your pips on new characters, costumes, spells, and other unlockable trinkets. But the goal of all the spellcasting isn't just to gather money; it's to solve environmental puzzles to progress to the next chapter. The puzzles aren't difficult; you can solve almost any of these conundrums by simply making sure you've hovered your spell cursor over everything you possibly can. But doing so is a lot of fun since there's so much variety in how various environmental elements react to your manipulations. Sconces light up and lavish you with fireworks. Mops clean puddles, and brooms sweep up dusty paintings. The inhabitants of Hogwarts' living portraits toss you important trinkets, or grant you access to new areas if you're controlling a member of the right house. If you're controlling Ron, Boggarts appear as spiders, and casting Riddikulus causes them to clumsily dance about on roller skates for a few moments. (If you're controlling Harry, these same Boggarts appear as Dementors.) You release Scabbers or Crookshanks to enter confined spaces, and you brew Polyjuice potions when you need to appear as another student. There's a lot to do, all of the time, and while none of these tasks are challenging, the diversity keeps things always enjoyable.      Between story missions, you can explore Hogwarts and other optional areas, such as Gringotts Bank. You might finish a quick play through in six hours if you're just interested in seeing the story, but Lego Harry Potter is the kind of game you return to again and again to uncover its various secrets and collectibles. You won't be able to enter certain areas and perform certain spells your first time through, so to see everything the game has to offer, you must return to the levels in free play using different characters. Even if you think you're being thorough the first play through, you'll be lucky to approach 50 percent completion. But whether it's your first time through or your fifth, you should take another wizard to class with you. While there is no online co-op (again), another player can drop in at any time and take over for one of your AI companions. Not only does having a buddy with you make for a better time, but you won't need to rely on the friendly AI, which isn't always helpful when it comes to cooperative puzzle solving. Luckily, AI failings are much less common now than in previous games, and co-op puzzles aren't frequent, making these imperfections a minor quibble.       The AI isn't the only lingering flaw to carry over into the newest Lego game, but like that particular aspect, the others have been thankfully marginalized to the point of being barely noticeable. Slippery edges and odd camera angles hinder a couple of platforming sequences, but there are so few of them that you won't be too bothered. Similarly, while there are some combat sections, they are very light, and few of them feature the respawning enemies that tainted Lego games of years past. In fact, they come as a happy change of pace among the many puzzles. We did encounter a few glitches, however. The game often hiccups between cutscenes, and on multiple systems, choosing to quit from the main menu caused the game to hang, forcing us to shut down the process from the Windows task manager. It's to the game's credit that such problems are so easily dismissed in light of all the fun and variety that so deftly veils them.     Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is easily the best Harry Potter game to date, though if that sounds like a backhanded compliment, consider this: It's one of the finest Lego adventures to date as well, which is no faint praise. By minimizing the repetitive combat and inconsistent platforming, Traveller's Tales has also minimized the frustrations, making this excursion to Hogwarts enjoyable for the whole family. Minor flaws, old and new alike, keep Lego Harry Potter from becoming a family-friendly classic, but it's charming and funny, and most importantly, it's fun. And that kind of magic is all too uncommon, even in Harry's world.    "
2819,The Sims 3,8.0,2,"     The Sims 2: Pets. That's not to say that they can't bring in money. Dogs, for instance, can occasionally dig up valuable chunks of meteorite worth several thousand simoleans. Meanwhile, cats can exercise their predatory skills on rodents and beetles and even the occasional low-maintenance pet. Best of all, dogs, cats, and horses are all individually controllable, which means that you can focus a lot of your attention on the pets at the expense of your human sims if you're so inclined. This goes a long way toward filling the waiting periods that occur when the pets' owners are at work.     But nothing distinguishes the PC version from its console counterparts quite like the inclusion of horses. Not only can you customize horses with an array of options approaching those allowed for cats and dogs, but you can also train them to run in races or take part in jumping competitions. And since your human sim can learn how to ride as well, it's possible for horse and rider to train together and start raking in masses of simoleans that would have been unheard of in previous expansions. You don't even have to wait to take advantage of this system since The Sims 3: Pets lets you adopt a horse much as you would a dog or a cat. If you don't mind waiting, however, you can also search for stray horses in the wild (not to mention unicorns), many of which reward you with certain skills already prepared. The only drawback is that they take a bit longer to train.     If rewards are what you're after, though, you might be better served by breeding your beloved cats, dogs, or horses and selling them for a profit. Skills play heavily into their worth, so your sims need to teach them how to hunt or race effectively if you expect to benefit from your experiments in genetics. But you shouldn't expect the operation to turn into a digital puppy mill. Pets require a lot of love and attention to their wishes, and horses in particular require specialty chores, such as hoof maintenance and stall cleanup. It's hard work, but it's worth it. If you fulfill enough of your horse's wishes, you gain access to a special lifetime reward that increases the chances of wild animals visiting your home.       Beyond that, The Sims 3: Pets does an excellent job of making the pets feel like pets. The animations are masterful, and they provide enough spirit that you could watch a cat hunt or play with his toys for minutes at a time. In addition, pets can grow old and die, which inevitably throws your sims into fits of grief once they discover the tragedy. And most of the time, you won't even have to worry about technical issues marring the presentation. Over a month has passed since the game's initial release, and EA has taken the time to clean up virtually all of the few glitches that appeared at launch.   The Sims: Unleashed. Here, almost everything works as it should, and the pets themselves add a dose of realism that probably should have shipped with the first game in 2009. But it's important to understand that this expansion is primarily aimed at enhancing the experience of your existing sims. Much as with the console versions, the impact the pets have on the world at large is negligible. Take the time to get to know them, however, and you'll find yourself in one of the better expansions for the game. Pets enrich our daily lives, so it's only fitting that they should enrich the lives of our sims as well.    "
3711,Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Eye of the Beholder,5.0,1,"As time goes by, the Game Boy Advance is becoming home to a decidedly interesting variety of games. In addition to all the original platformers, pseudo-3D racing and sports games, and surprisingly good role-playing games, we're starting to see more and more ports or compilations of classic arcade games, 8-bit and 16-bit console games, and even computer games for the tiny system. Eye of the Beholder falls into the latter category--it's an odd translation of a once-famous Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based computer role-playing game. Most Game Boy Advance owners probably aren't familiar with the original, both because it's a PC game and because it's about 12 years old. Thus they won't realize how this new GBA version of Eye of the Beholder is actually a big departure from the original, and they also probably won't get why some consider the original to be a classic among computer RPGs. That's because this new version of the game has a decidedly dated and awkward feel to it, though GBA owners who are also D&amp;D fans will find some redeeming qualities.  The screenshots make Eye of the Beholder out to be a 3D first-person game, but it's actually not 3D at all. The entire adventure takes place beneath the surface of the city of Waterdeep, and as such, throughout Eye of the Beholder, you'll be navigating tight, claustrophobic corridors one step at a time. There's no sense of transition as you move forward through the mazes, an effect that long-time gamers familiar with role-playing games like The Bard's Tale or the original Eye of the Beholder will immediately recognize. But anyone who hasn't been gaming for more than 10 years will be surprised by this now-crude effect, which is pretty disappointing considering the Game Boy Advance has proven itself to be capable of rendering 3D environments relatively smoothly in games like Doom and Duke Nukem Advance. Furthermore, the dungeons in Eye of the Beholder use extremely repetitive artwork, and the only real variety comes from seeing different types of stone walls in the different levels of the dungeon, so don't expect to see a lot of interesting sights beneath Waterdeep. A mere handful of canned sound effects and a near absence of music do nothing to help the presentation.    For what it's worth, the first-person sequences do look basically similar to those of the original 1990 game. On the other hand, the game's combat is completely different on the GBA. In the original, you'd fight from that first-person perspective, but here, the game switches to an isometric view that's reminiscent (both visually and otherwise) of old, old computer role-playing games such as SSI's Gold Box series and the early Ultimas. Here you'll control your party of up to six adventurers one at a time as they combat numerous opponents using melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic. The controls are pretty clunky--you'll have to press diagonally on the D pad to get your people to move anywhere, and the pace of the battles is pretty slow. The combat has some other frustrating points, such as the fact that there's no good way to maneuver your party members around each other. But it can still make for some good, tactical fun as you try to keep your weaker party members out of harm's way while bolstering your front lines with healing spells and such. A pretty good variety of magic is available, including D&amp;D mainstays like magic missile and fireball.    Still, the fighting can get very repetitive, and when you aren't fighting, you're navigating corridors, which certainly isn't any more fun. Besides the inherently mazelike structure of most levels, you'll come across an assortment of traps, hidden doors, and puzzles that will bar your progress. Some of this stuff can be so subtle that you'll end up wandering about without much of a clue of how to proceed until you stumble upon a solution. This sort of game design used to be acceptable in computer role-playing games, but it's difficult to appreciate now, at a time when games can challenge you in much more compelling ways.    The presence of an auto-map feature is only marginally helpful as you walk through countless passageways, as it can be difficult to tell where you've been and where you haven't. Other aspects of the game are even clunkier. Each character has his or her own inventory, so switching equipment between characters is a real chore. Also, for some reason, the game seems to provide no information about any of the weapons or armor you'll find. If you're a D&amp;D buff who knows offhand whether a dwarven war axe is better than a falchion, then more power to you, but it would have been nice if the game or even the manual had provided this information. You don't even get any feedback in battle, so who's to say what sorts of bonuses or penalties your characters have due to their particular combinations of equipped weapons and armor? You'll just have to get a feel for it. Considering how statistics-heavy most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games are, and considering how complicated Eye of the Beholder is in other aspects, it's awfully strange that it doesn't clue you in to a lot of interesting and useful data.  The game uses a stripped-down version of the 3rd Edition D&amp;D rules. Only four basic character classes are available, and there aren't many races to choose from when creating your party members. Creating your own characters involves the cumbersome process of rerolling your ability scores over and over until you generate some decent numbers, though a default party is available. The game also includes a number of 3rd Edition D&amp;D's social abilities, such as intimidate and bluff, which can figure into the game's occasional interactions with non-player characters. These probably make for some of the more interesting moments, though they still aren't that special, and character interaction is generally very rare.    Much like the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based computer role-playing games, Eye of the Beholder can last you for a while. But this awkwardly designed and rather ugly-looking game can by no means be recommended to everyone, nor is it necessarily suitable for fans of other GBA role-playing games. The best things Eye of the Beholder has going for it are its nostalgia value for fans of the original and its use of some Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules and characters. If that's enough for you, then by all means give this decidedly unusual GBA role-playing game a shot. "
136,Gotham Knights,4.0,0,"Batman is dead. With so few words, Gotham Knights is instantly intriguing. What does Gotham look like without its Dark Knight perched over the rotten city? What do his nemeses--many of whom exist in some way because Batman did--do without him? Most importantly, what impact does his death have on Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Red Hood, the so-called Bat-family? Their leader's sudden demise leaves a massive hole in the heart of Gotham, and Gotham Knights is the story of sidekicks stepping out from his shadow. Although the new guard fares well from a narrative standpoint, the gameplay systems built to serve their 30-hour campaign to reclaim Gotham let the team down.This isn't an Arkham game, though Gotham Knights does use the beloved series as a jumping-off point. In a totally open-world version of Gotham City, the Bat-family will still spend much of their time swooping down on enemies from gargoyles overhead and chain attacks with stylish combat moves as they dispatch packs of gangsters. They'll still crawl through vents to get the drop on baddies who are feeling empowered by Batman's sudden departure. The open world is also structurally familiar in the way it carries the player through the game. It is full of icons ranging from main story beats to one-off time trials and challenges, so at first glance this version of Gotham doesn't seem all that different from other versions of it, or other open-world games for that matter.Though it looks the part, with its stark class divide, constant crime sprees, and neo-noirish intentions, patrolling the urban sprawl is sadly a chore. Because Gotham Knights trades the tried-and-true action-adventure roots of recent Batman games for a loot-focused brawler, the cadence of action foregoes compelling storylines that complement the main campaign for rote and repetitive street brawls that reward you with crafting resources. The game starts really strong, with several authored story missions that feel nearly as big and bold as you'd expect, given the last 15 years of Gotham-set games. After that intro, however, the game settles into unremarkable and unfilling gameplay loops driven by awkward games-as-a-service design principles.This is most evident in how each character's unique traversal tool and fourth skill tree is unlocked as part of their Knighthood challenges. Batgirl glides, Nightwing has a mechanical drone, and so on. But you can't use any of those items until you complete 10 Premeditated Crimes with each hero. These are merely scattered street crimes found around the city and repopulated constantly. The issue won't be a shortage of them, but rather a lack of intrigue around any of them. To unlock these Premeditated-class street crimes, you have to find clues by first completing smaller, quicker street crimes. Almost immediately, this chain of events gets boring: Spam street crimes where enemies number around a half-dozen to unlock bigger versions of, essentially, the same content.You'll want to get these out of the way quickly to earn the unlocks waiting for you, so after a hot start including a memorable scene where Harley Quinn is taunting the heroes while almost grieving Batman, it soon descends into hours of completing 40 forgettable side missions, all built on a procedurally-generated mission structure that varies slightly in objective but never in practice: Go here, beat up anyone glowing red in your augmented reality vision mode, complete any additional objectives or challenges to get bonus experience, and you're done. If I were being charitable I could argue that this is a realistic portrayal of Gotham. It would be exhausting to patrol such a relentlessly troubled city each and every night, knowing there's really no end in sight, no grand reward for your efforts. But that likely wasn't the intention, and it doesn't make a good video game.Worse, once you have those Knighthood challenges completed, you'll still bump up against these forgettable side missions frequently. Boss storylines are level-gated so you can't quickly see the end of any questline, and to level up in between major boss missions, you'll often be doing more of these street crimes. Meanwhile, iconic characters like The Penguin and Lucius Fox are made to be nothing more than immobile quest-givers doling out missions that are more like basic challenges to earn a new suit blueprint or a mess of crafting resources. Becoming Gotham City's watchful protector should be a meaningful journey for the characters and the players controlling them, but it rarely amounts to feeling like anything more than busywork.Boss battles are where excitement should be expected, but there are too few of them and they lack the variety and ingenuity of past showdowns, even in developer WB Montreal's past Bat-effort. Aside from the main storyline that heavily involves The League of Shadows and The Court of Owls, you'll do battle with Harley, Clayface, and Mr. Freeze. Each of these questlines is started very early on in the game, so it was a surprise when no more appeared before the credits rolled. I'd have less of an issue with this number if the final battles within each of them were more diverse or interesting, but they each inevitably devolve into an arena battle against a damage-spongey villain and maybe an intermittent horde of goons. There's nothing memorable about any of them.Although there are a sparse number of puzzles to solve in addition to the meager amount of bosses to fell, combat is the game's central system that everything is built upon. You'll be driving, gliding, or sprinting around the streets and off the rooftops of the city each night, looking for heads to crack. Like the mission design and writing, combat initially makes a strong impression by being distinct from previous Batman games. The problem, however, is it fails to evolve as the game goes on.It swaps out the active counter-heavy model for something more RPG-like, where cooldowns and a ""Momentum"" meter lord over your capabilities, and it can look cool for a while. You'll stylishly take down foes of a few different classes, like big brutes with shields or molotov-tossing ne'er-do-wells, but rather than Arkham's very defensive-minded combat, where you systemically had an answer to everything thrown your way, here it's more about keeping the pressure on and always hitting something--it's the difference between action and reaction. It emphasizes the Momentum meter over the actual learned techniques that Batman must've taught the foursome, and seemingly all in the name of being an RPG that demands sturdy enemies who can't be dispatched with the same ease that Batman has shown before.None of these characters are Batman, so them being more acrobatic, like Nightwing, or bone-crushing, like Red Hood, is a fine change of pace aesthetically. But as it plays out, it reveals a lack of variety. Moves look different for each character, but the button presses you'll perform nearly follow the same script the whole game no matter who you are. Each character's unique special moves are the only thing that really separates the heroes from each other.The Court of Owls, perhaps the biggest and most beloved new addition to the Batman mythos in a long time, fails to live up to the potential of its comic book source material. In the comics, the Court is a creepy, ever-present threat whose existence is up for debate; merely whispering about them could get you killed, or so say the dark nursery rhymes. That element of the villainous secret society is touched on here, but it all feels like lip service via a few lines of dialogue that aren't supplemented by what is shown. In practice, the Court feels like any other faction of enemies, especially when you so often come across them taking part in street crimes, thereby totally neglecting the cabal's most important characteristic: their working from the shadows.That's not to say WB Montreal misunderstands its cast of characters. Although the Court is narratively fumbled, the game's brightest spot is certainly its foursome of heroes. Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing are handed the keys to the city without warning, and they're not sure how to fill Batman's boots. As you progress, you'll unlock character cutscenes in their base of operations, the Belfry, or out in the city. Tonally, these are very often somber and serious, and help characterize the heroes as the grieving, unsure group of orphans they have essentially become. These moments are my favorite scenes in the game. Batman meant something different to each of them, and the writing captures this excellently. For example, Robin is grieving the loss of an idealized version of Bruce, while Nightwing's relationship was more complicated and not always amicable, which leaves him feeling oddly conflicted.Their emotional and personal growth is a rare bright spot in Gotham Knights, and their mechanical growth is also well-considered. Leveling up and playing with any one of them unlocks the same skill points for the others, which invites mixing in time with each of them. Swapping between characters doesn't just give you a new skill tree; it gives you a new perspective on this larger-than-life figure who has loomed over each of them for years, and is now suddenly and irreversibly absent. It lands as hard as intended, and it's compelling to see them pick up the pieces and grow together.That growing together is best done in co-op, where the game can be played with one other person. Although the lack of a four-player mode sticks out, playing with a friend is still a more enjoyable experience. This version of Gotham is not its best rendition, but it is massive and benefits from the basic video game truth that most everything is better in co-op. Gotham Knights smartly accounts for co-op play in a number of ways, too. Main story progress follows the host's lead, so opening the map as either player will reveal the host's current to-do list.However, anything the second player does carries over into their native saved data, including gear they've found and even story missions they've completed. If you join a friend for a while, then revert back in the campaign on your own save, you'll have the option to skip and get credit for missions you've already completed in co-op. This is a great detail that too few of these co-op-optional games overlook, so even though Gotham Knights isn't a great game in most respects, it does at least reveal a better path forward for games like it.It's too bad the city isn't more exciting, because with a welcome lack of co-op tethering, the head-canon of figuratively carving the city in half, each person declaring a territory and saying ""Good luck, see you in the morning"" could be a really fun way to role-play as these heroes. Instead, there's little reason to separate, as the peripheral content is so rote that you'll want to only do what's required of you to unlock the next major story beat, nothing more.There's even a peculiar lack of endgame content. Normally these loot-centric games are built on the long haul, but here the game has all the markings of a loot grind without any purpose to perform it. If my gear is good enough to beat the final boss--and it was--then what incentive do I have to keep playing to improve that gear? I suspect the forthcoming four-player co-op Heroic Assault mode launching in late November may better answer this question, but waiting five weeks to go back to a game that isn't very good in the first place isn't in my plans.By the end, the project as a whole feels a bit compromised, and instead of feeling the triumphant journey of iconic heroes, the lasting impression is one of a difficult development cycle. The sudden cancellation of the last-gen versions was perhaps the first sign, but more appear as you play. This includes a lack of a 60fps support on consoles, frame drops in solo or multiplayer, and an oddly high number of hidden loading screens. It feels old already, even as it can still look quite lovely when perched high above the city as its tireless guardian. Under the hood, I suspect this game is chugging along to make ends meet. It certainly feels that way to play it.Gotham Knights acts as more of a cautionary tale than the logical next step for this storied universe. For a long time no one knew how to make a compelling Batman game, and then we got four of them in seven years. Taking what worked before while seeking to evolve it is admirable, but the obsession over loot is ill-conceived, cynical, and tasteless. It feels as though volume of content is given precedence over meaningful content, and for those that might enjoy the grind, the endgame's absence will be noticeable.It's these rinse-and-repeat objectives that feel like they're made to fill time and push the loot that ultimately hamper the experience more than any other misstep. The game seems built to serve an almighty hours-played statistic that has lately felt frighteningly ubiquitous. Strong character work and a well-considered co-op experience can't save all that ails Gotham Knights, leaving this experience neither the one fans deserve, nor the one they need right now."
1241,Halo 5: Guardians,8.0,2,"With Halo 5, developer 343 Industries comes closer to meeting the many expectations the Halo name carries with it. This is only the developer's second original title, but some facets of the franchise's formula are at their best here. Guardians introduces new player movement, open level design, and an innovative new multiplayer mode, all to great effect. It also implements a new campaign structure, with eight playable characters across two separate teams, as one chases the other across the universe.On the one hand, you have Blue Team, comprising the Chief and three of his oldest Spartan comrades. On the other, you have Team Osiris, four soldiers new to the Spartan program, still learning each other's idiosyncrasies. Blue Team's Kelly and Fred speak in short sentences and knowing responses. Osiris is less familiar: Edward Buck's humor often comes during awkward pauses, while Tanaka reveals more about her past than the others asked for.This learning process aids us well, though, as we're newcomers too. It's fascinating to hear why Vale knows Sangheili, the language of the Covenant Elites. It's intriguing to catch glimpses of Locke's shady past. We're participating in the gameplay, yes, but we are still observers. In granting us these brief glimpses, 343 lends genuine personality to these soldiers.The Spartans' relationships unfold across what amounts to an extended chase sequence: the Master Chief is suspected of war crimes, so Locke and his team are ordered to bring him in. It's a bold thing, turning the face of your franchise into a possible villain. But it sets the stage for what could be an intriguing character study. Sadly, though, it never delivers.Halo 5 pulls us through this chase as it tries to tell a story about responsibility, the nature of artificial intelligence, and the fall of one's idols. But while there might be a compelling story to tell here, Halo 5 doesn't make use of the opportunities available. Cutscenes fade to black before they feel finished. Character motivations shift on a whim. Halo 5: Guardians spans several beautiful worlds, with chromatic mushroom fields and labyrinthine cave networks, but I seldom knew why I was there.343 devotes almost 30 seconds to a tangential rant by a ship's AI, but it can't clearly explain where I'm going. The ending is also weak, and although it's the second installment in a trilogy, it still ended during what seemed like the story's climax. Despite the frenetic pace of its gameplay, the campaign loses impact when there's not much story to contextualize missionsThere are also combat-free environments in Halo 5's campaign, in which you explore small, self-contained areas before embarking on the next mission.You can speak with Dr. Catherine Halsey, the founder of the UNSC Spartan program. You chat with friendly alien grunts as they sing, banter, and argue in their boredom. There are also audio logs scattered throughout the campaign, containing overheard whispers and fleeting conversations that, at their best, help flesh out Halo 5's backstory.But these sections don't fit. They're added weight to an already disjointed plot. The exploration-based areas and diary entries only serve to slow down the otherwise steady sprint through Halo 5's worlds, and I moved past them in an effort to keep the experience moving.But in the end, my frustration with the campaign's narrative was offset by how good the gameplay feels. 343 has added several abilities to the usual Spartan skillset, granting new options to the already tight controls. You can ground pound unsuspecting enemies from above. You can dash to one side to avoid that rocket barrelling past your team. The Smart Link--a neural interface that grants a zoom ability with every weapon--lets you hover mid-air as you line up a shot. Now more than ever, I actually feel like a super soldier.That 343 has introduced these drastic changes to the formula, while still maintaining that responsive Halo feel, is admirable. As a Halo veteran, this feels like I remember, but also adds another layer of nuance to my muscle memory. Halo 5 introduces a new kinetic vocabulary that's not essential to survival, but it certainly helps.Now more than ever, I actually feel like a super soldier.You can also finish sprints with a brutal melee smash. While this is useful for depleting Elites' shields, or sending grunts careening across the map, it also opens up side routes through Halo 5's open-ended mission layouts. Gone are the linear pathways of the series' past: these new environments function more as arenas, with varying elevations and avenues of approach. There are also hidden weapon stashes and vehicle depots. If you don't mind the erratic narrative, these missions are worth replaying, just to see them unfold differently a second time.Halo 5 is best played cooperatively, though, with three friends. The ability to split into two teams, cover each other from different angles, and utilize every weapon possible leads to a wide array of emergent gameplay situations. One of my favorite missions places two players in Forerunner phaeton ships while the other two progress on the ground. The foot soldiers concentrated on enemy ground troops, while the pilots destroyed imposing laser turrets. The juxtaposition of aerial and foot combat, and the interplay between them, is Halo 5 at its best.Four-player co-op also erases the weight of the ally AI, which fills any spots devoid of a human player. To be fair, the AI performs well at times: after pointing out a priority enemy target, my artificial teammates are quick to focus their fire. But other times, the AI is abysmal. Halo 5 grants you a second chance before forcing a respawn, allowing your teammates to revive your dying character. And this works well in co-op, when two players can provide cover fire as the third rushes to the rescue. But without a human touch, this situation devolves into a train of suicide missions as the AI rushes into certain death, one by one.Yet despite the inconsistent AI, and despite its incomprehensible plot, this is a fast-paced campaign with smart level design and fluid gameplay. At its best, the shooter rewards teamwork between four friends, encourages clever use of its new movement system, and unfolds across a variety of gorgeous worlds. By the end, however, it drags us through a convoluted plot with poor storytelling.But then there's the multiplayer. And here, Halo 5 excels. In fact, this is the best shape Halo's multiplayer has ever taken.The classic Halo playlists, such as Slayer, Capture the Flag, and the fan-favorite SWAT, eschew the modern multiplayer progression system introduced with Halo 4. Now, instead of earning new weapon options a la Call of Duty, Halo 5 returns to form with universal weapon loadouts, and by scattering power weapons throughout each map, delivers a welcome departure from the tedious unlock system of its predecessor.You won't develop the necessary competitive reflexes over the course of a single match. Arena will make sense right away, but multiplayer skill comes with practice. When practice feels this fluid, though, and movement this dynamic, acquiring those skills isn't a chore.This is the best shape Halo multiplayer has ever taken.While Arena feels great in a tactile sense, and captures the essence of what makes Halo multiplayer compelling, Halo 5's new Warzone departs from franchise tradition several times over. It takes inspiration from the MOBA genre, combining player vs. player tactics with player vs. environment combat. And it's one of the best new ideas in not just this series, but the shooter genre in general.Warzone spans huge maps, in lush jungles and barren arctic landscapes. Each team has a plethora of options laid out before it, from capturing neutral zones, to killing enemy players, to defeating AI combatants. Several times throughout each match, AI mini-bosses will spawn. These opponents pilot Banshee fighter ships and drive Wraith tanks, and present a greater challenge than the normal AI fodder. These are the objectives in Warzone, and this is a mode that forces teams to make decisions.Matches are won by accruing 1000 points. Each kill, each zone capture, and each slain mini-boss contributes to that total. Teams must choose where to strike, and when to do so. Warzone is brilliant because, as with the rest of Halo 5, there is momentum here--but this is a force that shifts from side to side with each match. Warzone isn't so much about consistency--it's about adaptability. And the team that can roll with the punches, and punch back at the right moments, will have the upper hand.After ranking up, and achieving certain accolades throughout Halo 5's multiplayer modes, you'll earn requisition points. These act as currency for three tiers of item packs, each containing random weapon unlocks, vehicle orders, and aesthetic items. And they succeed in changing the way you play based on the equipment available. By gaining energy throughout each match, you burn through cards, thereby granting weapons and vehicles to aid in the battle. These can turn the tide of skirmishes, allowing you to defeat certain bosses when others can't.By ordering a Wraith tank, my team stemmed the flow of enemy soldiers to the nearest capture zone. At 950 points, victory was within reach. We established a frontline, held our position, and within five minutes, gained enough points to win the match. Requisitions were helpful, and could provide a rewarding reason to return to Halo 5's multiplayer after the first few weeks--but it's the careful blend of overarching strategy and moment-to-moment tactics that push Warzone forward.In some ways, Halo 5 is the boldest Halo yet. The franchise's multiplayer is at its peak, with a mode I'm sure I'll return to several times over. But then there's the campaign, which introduces fluid new movement and open level design, yet can't tell a coherent story to match. There are signs of a phenomenal shooter here, but certain narrative aspects feel underdeveloped, holding the franchise's newest sequel back from true excellence."
3576,Floigan Bros. Episode 1,5.0,1,"Sega is no stranger to taking risks. Over the life span of the Dreamcast, Sega has released some of the most daring, innovative, and genuinely fun software of modern console gaming. Games like Shenmue, Jet Grind Radio, and Phantasy Star Online have, if nothing else, proven Sega's willingness to think outside the box. Of course, this risk-taking doesn't always pay off as one would hope, and sometimes the audacious vision lacks focus--look at the acid-tongued virtual pet Seaman or Kenji Eno's ambitious cinematic adventure/train wreck, D2. Floigan Brothers, the latest from Sega Sports collaborator Visual Concepts, most definitely falls into the latter category. There are hints of inspiration throughout, with the game sporting some good-looking visuals, a catchy soundtrack, and a distinct sense of style. But the game's length, uneven gameplay, and atrocious camera negate these virtues. Floigan Brothers takes inspiration from the classic mismatched buddy formula used in the black-and-white television days of comedy, as well as the comedic violence of old Warner Bros. cartoons--imagine Laurel and Hardy or Abbott &amp; Costello done over by Tex Avery, and you'll get the general idea. The story begins with Moigle, the supersized, simple-minded brother, working on a secret project in the workshop on the Floigan family junkyard. There are a few items that are key to his plans, so he charges his diminutive but quick-witted older brother Hoigle to help him collect the necessary parts from around the junkyard. In addition, the evil Baron Malodorous has his eye on the land that the Floigans' junkyard rests on and is determined to drive the brothers out. The gameplay hinges on the disparity between the characters' size and intelligence. You have direct control over Hoigle, who in turn has a certain amount of control over Moigle. Moigle isn't so bright and generally acts on emotion, which makes him relatively easy to manipulate. You have a variety of techniques available to you: You can placate Moigle with food and games, you can depress him with insults to his character, and you can infuriate him with a couple of quick slaps. Using these skills, you solve a variety of action-by-proxy puzzles throughout the junkyard, and these are interspersed with a good deal of simple minigames. The puzzles are pretty straightforward, and adventure game veterans will likely breeze right through the game--actually, most anyone will probably breeze right through it, as Floigan Brothers is incredibly short. Visual Concepts has incorporated some online capabilities into the game, such as downloadable puzzles and the ability to trade your Moigle with other players, but the value added here is nominal. In addition to the unchallenging puzzles and the game's brevity, the reliance on dull, simplistic minigames brings the whole experience down a notch. But even these problems are minor blemishes when compared with the game's deeply flawed camera. Employing no dynamic tracking, all camera movement in Floigan Brothers is done using the shoulder buttons. The camera is at a set radius from Hoigle, making it difficult to rotate the camera in the cluttered junkyard and downright impossible in any sort of close quarters. The camera also has a nasty habit of getting momentarily stuck underneath the ground, giving you a nice worm's-eye view of the underside of the ground's textures. Floigan Brothers has been in development for almost the entire life of the Dreamcast, and developer Visual Concepts has previously produced some of the most dynamic games on Sega's hardware. There is simply no excuse for the camera problems that Floigan Brothers is so rife with. The game's graphics really makes the camera problems all the more frustrating, as the graphics are really a pleasure to look at. The game's style is very reminiscent of old Warner Bros. cartoons, which it is miraculously able to pull off without resorting to cel shading. The characters are comically animated, and there is a tangible sense of atmosphere in the game--magpies pecking about the garden, your guard dog, Spitz, idly protecting and serving, and the appropriately upbeat, jazzy soundtrack. What might not agree with everyone is the voice acting. Both Hoigle and Moigle have a fair amount of speech, but some bits come up a whole lot more often than others, and Moigle's dim-witticisms can go from comedic to grating very, very quickly. Floigan Brothers has a distinct look and a clever concept, but these are its only strengths, and they aren't enough to support the rest of the game's numerous flaws. Even though the game is being marketed as a value title, it's a tough game to recommend, and the game's shortness makes it far more appropriate as a rental."
3868,Zoo Tycoon 2,5.0,1,"  Zoo Tycoon 2 for the Nintendo DS is a management sim that lacks the depth or difficulty to make it interesting for anyone other than its intended kiddie audience. But even so, parents looking at this title as a way to get their little tykes interested in the plight of some of the world's most endangered animal species may want to think again, as Zoo Tycoon 2 sends some decidedly mixed messages about animal welfare thanks to its ultrasimplistic gameplay.         Zoo Tycoon 2, like its predecessors, is all about creating great zoos with happy animals in healthy environments. So you can't do truly horrible things like get into the bear bile trade, stick kangaroos in aquariums, or make a beaver and a moose fight for your love. The happier your animals, the more people come to see them. The more people come, the more money you make, which you can then spend on improving your park and doing research to be able to house even more exotic creatures, and so on. It's a laudable premise, but the game's simplicity and options-light approach too often allow players to cut corners and place animals in some clearly overcrowded situations--a strange oversight for a game supposedly all about a greater appreciation for our animal brethren.      The biggest problem Zoo Tycoon 2 for the DS has is that its core gameplay--keeping your animals happy by creating the right environments for them, as well as monitoring their five basic needs--is so stripped of any complexity that you can literally use the same strategy for making all your critters happy regardless of their size, rarity, or temperament. There's simply no challenge to be found at all in the game's Campaign mode, a series of 15 scenarios split up into five difficulties. Each scenario tasks you with achieving certain objectives within a set time frame and budget, but they all amount to the same thing--start up your zoo with some basic animals, complete the research tree to unlock rarer ones, and watch the crowds roll in.      You must keep the game's animals in enclosures that match their respective natural habitats. You'll find this by selecting the animal once it's in your enclosure and finding out what its preferences are simply via tapping the animal favorites button. This will show its preferred ground surface, water type, foliage, and shelter, and will guide you directly to the purchase screen to buy, and then place, your selections.      If that sounds simple enough, it's because it is. Since exactly what's needed is clearly pointed out via a series of prompts, this process quickly becomes tedious as the ol' synapses never have to fire up at any stage to make any important decisions. Creating the perfect habitat for every animal--from otter to elephant--is as easy and quick as covering the ground with the appropriate surface, sticking some water in the corner, planting a tree here and there, putting down the occasional rock or shelter, and then placing a zookeeper in the enclosure to take care of all your animals.      Zoo Tycoon 2 does let you take a more hands-on role with the upkeep of your flock. The game's ZooKeeper mode lets you interact with any animal in the park, and is essentially a series of five minigames that directly impact an animal's happiness. All of these minigames are mind-numbingly straightforward, however, and will probably hold your interest for only a few rounds before you decide to ditch it completely and let a computer-controlled zookeeper do it for you. The feeding minigame, for example, presents you with four food options, but it's always easy to know which one to feed your chosen animal because the game highlights it for you.     The feeding minigame is but one example of Zoo Tycoon 2's almost fanatical dedication to remove anything remotely challenging from the game. Even at its highest difficulty, players can do the minimum amount of work and still come up with superhappy animals raring to procreate to continue their species. All of the nonanimal park options--such as food outlets, restrooms, gift shops, and more--seem to have little to no impact on how popular your zoo is with guests. We completed numerous campaigns with only basic hot dog shops and soft drink stands and had no problems earning the maximum star rating available. We even grouped together toilet blocks in just one corner of the zoo, and still our bladder-challenged patrons didn't complain.     To its credit, Zoo Tycoon 2 does include comprehensive details about all the animals featured on its roster for any curious kiddies. Information cards on each of the animals are collected as you progress through the game, and they contain plenty of information, such as its habitat, characteristics, and more.      Outside of the main campaign mode, Zoo Tycoon 2 for the DS features a freeform mode where you can set your own parameters such as starting cash, type of zoo, and more. There are also two multiplayer modes: Trade a Zoo, in which you simply swap a zoo you've already created with a friend, and Tycoon Showdown, in which two players compete to build a better zoo from the same starting base. When it comes to controls, almost everything can be done using the stylus and touch screen, although we found it preferable to navigate around the maps using the DS's D pad.        DS games can look much better than what Zoo Tycoon 2 presents. The animal models in the game are uniformly poor, particularly from the default overhead zoo view, where it's often hard to tell one animal from another (Nile crocodiles, for example, look like slow-moving green smudges onscreen). Zookeeper close-ups of the animals don't fare much better--there are models for male, female, and younguns, but most look bad and in some cases are anatomically incorrect. The music here is average at best, made up mostly of African-infused sounds with a lot of percussion. Animal sounds are dull as well, and are limited to one sound per animal.     With the challenge factor dropped all the way down to zero, all that's left of Zoo Tycoon 2 for the DS is repetitive gameplay and some questionable animal-care ethics. Even kids may find this game dull, and while this beast isn't quite bad enough to be put down, it certainly isn't something you'd want to spend much time with.  "
3051,F.E.A.R. 3,8.0,2,"   F.E.A.R. 2's startling conclusion, but returns us to the protagonist of the original F.E.A.R., the genetically designed supersoldier known as Point Man. The events at the end of F.E.A.R. 2 have triggered a paranormal catastrophe of biblical proportions in the city of Fairport, and Point Man is eager to make his way there and help out a former squadmate caught up in the chaos. Point Man's not alone, though. His homicidal brother, Paxton Fettel, is along for the ride. Point Man may have put a bullet in his brother's brain in F.E.A.R., but Fettel isn't about to let a little thing like being dead keep him down. The brothers form an uneasy alliance, but despite the tension between them, the story progresses predictably. There's a pleasant sense of closure that goes with seeing the brothers confront the painful reality of their shared past, but there aren't any surprises or scares that will stay with you once the story has run its course. The visuals also won't work their way into your subconscious. F.E.A.R. 3's graphics are plain and lag behind current standards. As a result, the creepy living rooms, city streets, and food courts you fight your way through aren't quite as creepy as they should be; the environments lack the convincing level of detail to fully pull you in. The sounds are more effective; the loud blasts of gunfire heighten the intensity of firefights, and the ethereal wails that accompany ghostly visions may unsettle you a bit, even if the sight of them doesn't.     Point Man and Paxton Fettel are both playable, but when tackling the campaign alone, you must first play each stage as Point Man to unlock the option to play it as Fettel. Regardless of which character you're playing as, F.E.A.R. 3 is, at its core, a corridor shooter that shuttles you from one small area to another and sees you constantly beset by groups of enemies. Although the core action doesn't evolve much over the course of the game, the firefights remain exciting. The assortment of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and other weapons you can employ feel powerful, and the smooth controls make aiming and shooting a pleasure. And your melee attacks, which include a sliding kick that can send enemies flying like rag dolls, make it fun to sometimes forgo the use of guns and charge your enemies.     Most of your time is spent fighting soldiers in the private army of the evil Armacham corporation, and these enemies keep you on your toes by flanking your position, though they also occasionally do dumb things like get stuck while coming down stairs. All of the areas in which shoot-outs take place provide ample opportunities for cover, but a lot of cover is destructible, and it's a thrill to frantically dash from one position to another as your cover is blown to smithereens. F.E.A.R. 3 prevents the shoot-outs from growing tiresome by providing atmospheric periods between firefights. For instance, a few quiet minutes spent making your way through a defiled superstore build up the tension before the bullets start flying. And although Point Man and Paxton are figurative killing machines, the occasional opportunity to take control of a literal killing machine and make things very unpleasant for your adversaries is a lot of fun. At a few points during the campaign, you can commandeer two types of armored power suits. These powerful, lumbering contraptions make the assaults of Armacham soldiers laughable, and shooting helicopters out of the sky from inside one of these machines is a delicious taste of destructive power.       As Point Man, you have an edge in battle courtesy of your unnaturally fast reflexes. These let you trigger slow motion for brief periods, making it much easier to line up that perfect headshot or deal with an overwhelming number of assailants. There's nothing novel about the ability to go into slow motion in shooters anymore, but it's still cool to see the air vibrate in the wake of a speeding bullet that whizzes past your head or to watch as what's left of an enemy explodes in a bloody mess. Paxton lacks his brother's heightened reflexes but makes up for it with other talents. As a specter, he can't pick up guns (though he's still vulnerable to bullets), but he can suspend enemies helplessly in the air and fire deadly blasts of energy from his hand. He can also take possession of soldiers even from significant distances, and it's liberating to zap into the body of an enemy from across the room. A meter drains while you inhabit a body, and if it runs out, you're returned to spectral form. But enemies you kill leave behind psychic energy that you can use to refill your meter and prolong your possession time, encouraging you to take risks and not hide behind cover for too long.      Paxton's abilities are enjoyable to use in single-player, but it's when you tackle the campaign cooperatively that they really shine. The player controlling Paxton can suspend enemies in the air while Point Man pumps bullets into them. Paxton can zoom into the body of a distant enemy to flank a group of foes, and then Point Man can trigger slow motion and attack from the front. The constant opportunity to make a coordinated use of the brothers' complementary powers makes working with a partner a joy and distinguishes this game's cooperative play from that of many shooters in which all players have the same abilities.       F.E.A.R. 3 also has four multiplayer modes for up to four players. Soul King is a competitive mode in which players start in specter form. You take possession of soldiers and collect souls from fallen enemies, and the player with the most souls is declared the victor when time runs out. Players lose half their collected souls when killed, so scores can change suddenly even in the final seconds, which means that even those with a decent lead over their competitors shouldn't get too comfortable. In Soul Survivor, one player is corrupted into a specter at the beginning of the match, and that player sets out to corrupt the others, while the human players work together to survive. Both of these modes offer some quick thrills but aren't likely to keep you coming back for long.     In Contractions, you and your fellow players work together to survive against wave after wave of increasingly powerful enemies. Each map has a stronghold in the center, and between waves, players can either repair damaged barricades on the structure or venture out into the surrounding area to grab crates and return them to the base, providing weapons and ammo for future waves. The necessity of rebuilding and stocking up during the brief time between waves encourages teams to communicate well and devise a strategy for survival, and as the situation grows increasingly dire in later waves, this mode becomes more and more suspenseful. The most unusual of all the multiplayer modes is F***ing Run, in which you must hurry through areas while enemies attack you and a towering wall of death pursues you from behind. The wall moves quickly, leaving you no time to dillydally, and if any one player comes in contact with the wall, the mode comes to an end for all players. As the wall gets closer, the screen goes gray and the controller vibrates wildly, and because the stakes are so high, the prospect of being swallowed up by the wall is one of the most pulse-pounding positions F.E.A.R. 3 places you in.       In the end, F.E.A.R. 3's campaign doesn't quite excel. There are few surprises or standout moments, and those who remember the relentlessly creepy atmosphere and edge-of-your-seat scares of the original F.E.A.R. may lament the fact that this game feels like a military shooter with light horror elements. But although F.E.A.R. 3 won't terrify you or leave you gasping for more, it's a solid shooter that satisfies from start to finish.   "
4839,South Park Rally,2.0,0,"Even though the Dreamcast may possess considerably more processing power under the hood than the Nintendo 64 or PlayStation, nothing seems to be able to hide the fact that South Park Rally is simply not a good game.    The idea behind this South Park-licensed kart-racing game is that the fine citizens of South Park commemorate every holiday by holding a go-cart racing event. These events range from straightforward races to events in which the goal is to hold on to an item for a certain length of time. For example, on Valentine's Day, everyone assembles at Big Gay Al's place to shoot one another with Cupid's arrows. The catch is that there's only one bow that the racers must fight for control of by bumping the driver who has it, all the while trying not to get shot. Once you get the bow, you must get enough distance between yourself and the other drivers so you can get off a few shots without losing it. These non-race events have a similar setup, which makes the gameplay extremely fast paced and even frantic at times. To help you fend off or prevent the other racers from passing you or taking away a key object, the levels are filled with an arsenal of offensive and defensive weapons and items. Items like dogs, cats, and alien lasers can stall your opposition for a brief period of time. There are also objects like the Terrance and Phillip boxes that are filled with gas, giving you a momentary speed boost. You can even pick up Mr. Hanky, who patrols around your vehicle, keeping you free from harm for a limited time. So while the game's kart-styled items setup may sound like that of previous games in the genre, it's really South Park Rally's overall gameplay and control that keeps it from measuring up.   While fairly fun for a couple of minutes, the gameplay is quickly debilitated by poor control and physics, which make the game hard to play. The biggest problem with the control is the vehicles' turning speed. If you get yourself in a tight situation where competitors are coming right at you, you might as well just take it head-on, since turning around takes forever. You do have a braking feature that allows you to take tighter turns at higher speeds - however, this doesn't help you at all when you're stopped or going slow. Another problem is getting your vehicle back on its wheels after it flips, which happens a lot since the car physics are way too floaty, resulting in vehicles that bounce all over the place.    Graphically, South Park Rally on the Dreamcast obviously looks better than its N64 and PlayStation counterparts, and it certainly captures the flat, unrefined visuals of the show. However, compared to other Dreamcast games, the level of detail, 3D models, and the general quality of the graphics are noticeably below par. The one exception is that all the characters and their vehicles look fairly true to the show. As are the raunchy quips from the characters, which, while funny at first, become quickly tiresome as the variety of phrases is extremely limited.   Overall, South Park Rally's poor control and limited charm prove to be a detrimental combination that makes the game unbearable to play, even for the biggest South Park fan. South Park fans may want to rent this game, but its poor control and limited gameplay make it one that even the most die-hard fan will want to stay away from."
4266,WWII Normandy,4.0,0," 	As Allied troops stormed onto the beaches of Normandy in June of 1944, the entire world held its breath. Would Hitler's Wehrmacht be able to push back the invaders into the sea, or would the Allies break into the heart of France and free Europe after nearly three years of German occupation? WWII Normandy is a budget-priced first-person shooter that attempts to re-create the bloody battles fought by the 101st Airborne Division, which was dropped behind enemy lines near Utah Beach and given the assignments of clearing a breakout path for the landing forces and preventing enemy reinforcements from reaching the beachhead. Dense fog and the absence of markers for many of the drop zones led to a large portion of the division being killed or captured, but the survivors--though scattered and confused--eventually began to form small, improvised units and set about achieving their objectives. This is actually a pretty good premise for a single-player shooter, since many troops actually did find themselves alone behind enemy lines. But the game ultimately fails in spite of its concept, because WWII Normandy is one of the shortest shooters ever released: You can breeze through the entire game in about three hours at the standard difficulty setting.   It's true that the game would take longer to finish on the harder setting because the enemy's aim becomes impossibly good and because hits cause much more damage. But that doesn't change the fact that the levels in WWII Normandy are incredibly short--and it doesn't help that there are only 10 of them in the shipping version of the game (though the patch at ValuSoft's Web site does feature two bonus maps, which are considerably more challenging). Of further note, WWII Normandy includes no multiplayer component whatsoever.   Aside from not having the option of multiplayer, you'll never encounter any friendly troops in the game. Not living ones, anyway. The box copy claims that the game lets you take ""your place alongside these men of valor,"" but the only friendly troops you'll find are already dead. The only place you can take ""alongside"" these guys is in a graveyard. The box copy also boasts of ""historically accurate weapons"" and ""realistic damage,"" but in real life, it would probably take fewer than five or six slugs from a Colt .45 at close range to bring down a German soldier, like it does in the game.   It's not that realism is necessary in a shooter, but WWII Normandy falls short as a pure action game as well. The arsenal at your disposal is extremely limited: a machete, a pistol, a rifle, a machine gun, and a bazooka are all you get, and the only special items are grenades and land mines. Actually, the land mines provide one of the few interesting twists in the game, since you can take out four or five storm troopers at once if you manage to lure them near a land mine you've placed.   The enemy artificial intelligence in the game is flawed in several noticeable ways. Some Germans stand dumbstruck when you dash up to them and hack away with a machete, while others simply stand in the open and take bullet after bullet from your M1 rifle. On the other hand, some of the enemies actually seem pretty smart. Some will try to sneak around buildings and attack you from behind, and it's not uncommon to see a foe dive to the ground and start firing from the prone position. Too bad the grayish skin tone of the Germans makes them look like extras from Night of the Living Dead. And too bad that aside from their various uniform types, they're all essentially identical.   Perhaps it's not fair to hold a budget-priced game like WWII Normandy to the same standards as one that costs twice as much or more. But any shooter that even a relatively inexperienced player could tear through in a single sitting should qualify as a downloadable demo, not as a retail game. If you want to relive the Normandy invasion, take that $20 and use it toward the purchase of the Saving Private Ryan DVD. Besides, the film plays about as long as it'll take you to complete WWII Normandy.      	  "
3488,Singularity,8.0,2,"     The fictitious Russian island Katorga-12 is at the center of all this campy fun. As modern-day soldier Nate Renko, you're sent to this mysterious place to investigate the radiation that emanates from it. As it turns out, the Soviets had been working with a powerful substance called Element 99 (or E99) back in the 1950s--but it seems the experiments weren't entirely successful. The Russians were toying with time, and after a dramatic crash-landing, you're caught up in a kooky time-traveling melodrama worthy of broadcast on the Syfy Channel. You end up flopping back and forth between 2010 and 1955, but the specifics aren't important: what matters is that you gain use of a fantastic gizmo called the Time Manipulation Device, or TMD. With this appliance affixed to your left arm, you gain all sorts of fantastical time-manipulation powers. Drop a giant bubble that slows down everything caught within it. Age enemy soldiers until they turn into dust. Restore a collapsed staircase to its original state by turning back the clock. Your brain might turn to mush if you think too hard about the specifics, but you aren't meant to take the plot seriously. Instead, let the constant supply of ambling mutated freaks and skittering bugs pull you along for the ride.       The TMD has limited uses when you first discover it, but as you earn new powers (and upgrade them at stations you encounter along the way), you grow to appreciate the way it keeps the action fresh and satisfying. Different powers affect enemies in different ways. Dropping your temporal sphere will freeze human enemies in its radius, but will only slow some of the more hideous creatures or cause them to ""phase"" in to your time period--that is, to stay visible so you can shoot them. Some beasts will toss exploding barrels at you, but you can catch them and throw them back, just as you can with rockets lobbed in your direction. You can even turn your human foes into creatures to help keep the pressure off. Some of the fancier weaponry also turns up the craziness quotient. Using one rifle, you can steer your bullet directly into your target in slow motion, which results in a satisfying splash of blood. With the sniper rifle, you can use a similar slow-mo effect to chain shots together. You're shuffled through set-piece sequences punctuated by the occasional mild fright, always needing to switch between weapons and use all of these newfound abilities. It's this variety that elevates Singularity above every other run-of-the-mill shooter.         Singularity further mixes up the pace with puzzles and exploratory interludes. The puzzles aren't too taxing, but there's a certain cleverness to some of them, such as one in which you must roll a grenade through a hole in the wall toward a group of mutants feeding on their prey. You also scour nooks and crannies looking for E99 and other objects you use to upgrade your weapons and TMD. Thankfully, the dismal dinginess of outdoor environments and the glowing organic pods lining the corridors keep the scavenging interesting and keep the buzz of tension alive. Yet while the art style gives this alternate history a distinct sense of time (or times?) and place, Singularity is not a looker. It uses the Unreal 3 graphics engine, but low-resolution textures, flat lighting, and occasional animation glitches make the game look somewhat behind the times. Animation stutters aren't the only oddities we encountered, either. A retail copy of the PlayStation 3 version locked up on us twice, while in the Xbox 360 version, a barrel-throwing boss spawned outside of the play arena and forced us to revert to the previous checkpoint.         Singularity isn't a groundbreaking shooter, but it's an incredibly fun one. This is an example of how fluid pacing and a tongue-in-cheek attitude can make old conventions exciting again. Disappointing visuals and a smattering of minor flaws keep this first-person shooter from feeling completely modern, but not every game must probe the human soul to achieve greatness. Singularity achieves it with variety, moving you from one enjoyable sequence to the next without lingering too long on any given moment. Besides, this is a game in which you can both snipe hardened Soviet soldiers in bullet time and heal your teammates by puking on them. And is there any greater selling point?    "
4265,Stronghold Legends,4.0,0,"  It's gotten to the point that you don't know what you're going to get when you open the box of a new Stronghold game. The castle-building franchise from Hartford's Firefly Studios has gone through some significant changes over the past two years, but the latest version throws the whole formula out the window. Stronghold Legends moves the series out of the history books and into D&amp;D-styled real-time strategy territory with mythical heroes, dragons, and dwarves. Yet while this is admittedly a nifty idea, the switch from reality to fantasy kills the historical authenticity that has long been a trademark of the Stronghold line. Even worse, everything seems to have been crowbarred into the aged Stronghold 2 engine, resulting in a generic RTS that has more than a few serious technical and design issues.        The actual gameplay in Stronghold has little to do with the earlier games in the franchise. Here, instead of building a castle and getting knee-deep into the nitty-gritty of what it was like to live during the Middle Ages, you sign up for three campaigns out of medieval mythology. In the opener, you take on the role of King Arthur, battling against the Saxons for control of Britain. In the others, you play as Siegfried, the German dragon slayer and star of a Wagnerian opera, and Vlad the Impaler, the Transylvanian Turk-killer best known today as the bloody inspiration for Dracula.     But nothing of interest has been done to develop these storylines or settings. Buildings follow the RTS template and feature barracks, armories, granaries, and so forth. Resource gathering goes beyond the usual food, wood, and stone, but it does so by adding an annoying level of micromanagement to what should be a straightforward grind of building armies and attacking the bad guys. A game this simplistic probably shouldn't demand the collection and processing of any resources, as mission objectives always involve straightforward building armies and killing enemies.     All of the soldiers featured in each faction are virtually identical. There is little difference here whether you're fighting on behalf of the evil forces of Dracula or the noble knights of King Arthur. Also, since the units themselves are generic, the gee-whiz factor of getting to play Count Blah and his evil minions in an RTS fades quickly. You get little aside from the same old pikemen, archers, crossbowmen, and swordsmen. There is only so much that a developer can do with a medieval setting, of course, but no effort was made to provide significantly different troops to represent the nationalities and time periods represented. A millennium passed between the King Arthur campaign of the mid-400s and the Vlad campaign of the mid-15th century. You would think that more than the color of the shirts would have changed during that time.     At least the three sides vary quite a bit when it comes to the menageries of mythological beasties that they can throw into battle. Heroes like Arthur, Merlin, Siegfried, and Vlad have special powers that give them the ability to pull off feats like casting spells, knocking down walls, and summoning magical creatures. In the Arthur scenarios, you have access to heroic knights and wizards straight out of Malory; in the Siegfried ones, you deal with figures out of Norse legend such as frost giants; and in the Dracula missions, you get to play with Halloween refugees like creepers and werewolves. All of the units fit perfectly into their settings and make the game feel like a collection of folktales come to life.     Yet while these beasties add color to Stronghold Legends, and some cool moments like giants stomping pesky soldiers with their feet and Merlin blasting archers with lightning bolts, they don't do much for gameplay. For starters, most are underpowered. Dragons, for instance, are second-rate compared to Tolkien's Smaug and can be taken out by well-placed archers. Giants can be ganged up on by regular infantry grunts like pikemen and felled quicker than you can say fee-fi-fo-fum. And just breathing on the frail Merlin seems to kill him.  More play testing was also needed to root out some big problems with mission design and artificial intelligence. Most missions are laid out in an extremely linear fashion. You start at point A and kill everything until you reach point B, you defend a fortress until the clock runs out, and so on. But lack of imagination is the least of the game's issues. Enemy troops often continue patrolling mindlessly and actually ignore huge columns of your soldiers even after you've just smashed down or climbed a castle wall. They often don't react to crossbowmen or archers firing away at them, either, and sometimes choose to walk away from battles or abandon sieges. The narrator who provides tips on enemy attacks frequently comes out with lines like, ""Woodsmen have seen a band of enemy troops heading this way!"" right before they turn around and head back home. The game was obviously shipped without a fully functioning AI.       It also wasn't shipped with a modern graphics engine. Stronghold Legends looks like it was made with the same dated 3D technology that powered Stronghold 2, which unfortunately means that it looks like it was released around 2002. Visuals are drab and dingy overall, with blocky castles, dull building styles with little in the way of convincing detail, and terribly animated units that wobble back and forth when they run, like packs of chain-mail-clad Fat Alberts. Because there is no collision detection, battles between human armies immediately degenerate into undulating, colored blobs with no way to tell what's going on or who's winning.     Audio quality is a bit better, thanks to suitably cheesy voice acting during scenarios and soldiers' shouts during charges that really get the blood moving. Lines are repeated way too often, though, and frequently misstate what's actually going on. Once per mission, you'll usually hear something completely incongruous such as, ""The enemy's ladders are on the walls!"" even though you're not actually defending any walls at the time.        And even though Firefly should know its way around this engine by now, there are some serious bugs here. Crashes to the desktop are an infrequent occurrence, but the big problem is that units rarely respond properly to commands. They run by targeted enemies and often turn their backs on foes, giving them a free shot or two at you while you slowly rotate around to attack. Mass attacks directed at specific baddies always result in some units attacking and many others just standing around cooling their heels. It's best not to attack directly at all, as you're more likely to get everyone in on the action if you move close to the enemy and let the AI take over from there. Installing the version 1.10 patch didn't seem to rectify any of these issues, either.     There are some appealing alternatives to the campaigns, although considering all the gameplay problems and bugs, it's hard to contemplate why anyone would want to bother with them. Still, the three Legends Trails sets of linked skirmish maps is an intriguing idea that plays like a trio of solo ladders. Custom skirmishes with up to four players can also be played, both online and off. There does seem to be a fair number of people looking for matches online, too, so you can find games pretty easily. And a map editor is also included for players who want to roll their own skirmish scenarios.     The developers were obviously going for a you-got-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter moment here by throwing D&amp;D into their medieval simulation series, but Stronghold Legends is just another second-rate RTS. While incorporating giants and dragons into the mix may seem like a natural fit these days, as any game with castle walls in it seems to demand the addition of Tolkienesque beasties to knock them down, you've got to do more than just toss such creatures in with generic armies and buggy gameplay. This is an interesting concept that deserved more careful attention than the designers gave it.

789,Spyro Reignited Trilogy,8.0,2,"Many would-be mascots have come down the pike over the years, trying to capture just the slightest hint of Mario-level stardom. Spyro the Dragon never quite got there, but he did manage to star in some of the most charming and accessible platformers of the PlayStation era, and the Reignited Trilogy is a grand testament to the little guy's staying power.The trilogy includes the first three--and best--titles in the series: Spyro the Dragon, Ripto's Rage (also known as Gateway to Glimmer in Europe and Australia), and Year of the Dragon. His adventures are simple but delightfully cartoonish fare. The first game has him traveling through the five dragon realms freeing his bigger, badder brethren from Gnasty Gnorc. The second has Spyro attempting to take a vacation after his previous adventure, but winding up getting dragged into a realm being invaded by effete warlock Ripto. The third has him facing off against the evil Sorceress, who has stolen over 100 dragon eggs with the help of her rabbit apprentice, Bianca.Ignore the graphical overhaul, and these are very much the games that released the first time around on PS1. The fact that they stand up so well mechanically against more recent games is the most pleasant surprise of the package. Movement and attacks are one-button affairs, and the simplicity works in the collection's favor. If there's a learning curve to be found, it's in the fact that it's all too easy to use Spyro's charge attack too recklessly, sending him flying off cliffs or missing the enemy he's aiming for by inches.Thankfully, Spyro’s moveset need not do much heavy lifting, especially in the first game. Every area has a number of crystallized dragons to find, and once enough of them have been freed, you take a balloon off to the next dragon realm, and repeat until you reach Gnorc's trashy fortress. There's some minor puzzle solving, and an enormous amount of treasure to be found, and that’s about it. If anything, the first game's biggest weakness is that there's so much other stuff to collect, between the hundreds of gems, hidden treasure chests, and dragon eggs stolen by hidden--and super annoying--Egg Thieves, but only freeing the dragons really matters in terms of progress.The sequels are much better in that regard. Each stage has its own little tale of animated hijinks that plays out, from a tribe of Himalayan telepaths being terrorized by a Yeti, to my personal favorite, helping superspy moppets Hansel and Gretel stealth their way into a heavily guarded fortress of nomadic lizards so they can use their psychic powers and take over. There's a slew of unique challenges within each stage for you to do, usually involving super-powered versions of Spyro's current abilities or sequences where you have to take to the skies and firebomb specific objects for gems. The third game brings new playable characters into the fray, all with their own specific movesets and bonus stages, giving you a very good reason to run around collecting shiny stuff to unlock it all. The linear repetition of the first game never rears its head again for the rest of the collection.As mentioned, it speaks well of the originals that the Reignited Trilogy doesn't change a thing mechanically and all three games are still a joy to play. The audio has gotten a bit of remixing and reworking but remains fairly true to the original soundtrack, which can be switched to on the fly. But the Reignited Trilogy goes above and beyond here, giving all three games an impressive visual overhaul, essentially making all three games close to a Dreamworks animation. More than just new lush-looking foliage, skin and scale textures, and warm, blissful lighting, hundreds of tiny new details are here, giving each character and enemy more personality. There are a bunch of visual gags and quirks every character will run through if you leave them alone for a moment. The generic gruff dragons from the original are all unique creatures with their own personalities when imparting knowledge to Spyro, same for the dragon babies in Year of the Dragon, who each react like delightful, rambunctious toddlers when they hatch. The Spyro trilogy already felt timeless to play. Now, it’s much more dazzling to look at.The Reignited Trilogy is the best kind of collection that not only brings a beloved series up to current visual standards but also proves just how well-built the original titles were. Granted, the originals were done by a little studio called Insomniac, and it's not exactly surprising something that team did is a fine example of the genre. But the Reignited Trilogy's developer, Toys for Bob, deserves major kudos for bringing Insomniac's vision to life in the way we could've only dreamed in 1998. Spyro Reignited Trilogy is featured on our list of the best Xbox games for kids.  "
4932,Pimp My Ride,2.0,0,"  How do you break a bad game? Ask the developers of Pimp My Ride for the PSP, as they have achieved this dubiously wondrous feat. Based on the hit MTV car-customization show starring the self-proclaimed Mr. Black Bruce Willis himself, Xzibit, Pimp My Ride was originally released late last year on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. Mixing a lousy driving game with completely pointless minigames that barely tied everything together into something that vaguely resembled the concept of the show, it was a poor piece of work. Now the game has come to the PSP, and it is with no amount of exaggeration that we state that Pimp My Ride is, hands down, the worst console-to-PSP port to date. Think of every single issue that's ever plagued a console game translated to the PSP, combine them all with a game that was already no fun to begin with, and you'll have a pretty good idea of where this game stands. Toss in the fact that Activision is charging $40 for this busted piece of junk, and Pimp My Ride goes from merely awful to outrageously abysmal in a split second.         Pimp My Ride takes place in the glorious metropolis known as Pimp City. The residents of Pimp City like to drive pimped-out rides. So, what's an up-and-coming car-customization nerd like you to do when tasked with making the unpimped rides of the town's more hapless citizens into full-on works of pimp-flavored art? Why, drive around doing lame ghost riding and cruising minigames to earn cash so you can drive around in the customer's clunker to get new parts and make it into a gaudy monstrosity, of course. And then you do this exact same sequence of events over and over and over again until the game concludes, or you simply can't stomach the lame gameplay any longer.      Odds are, the wrecked frame rate and abysmal driving controls will cause you to give up long before you get anywhere near the end of this thing. Pimp My Ride has the worst frame rate of any game in the PSP library. It stays somewhere in the teens at its best moments and drops into single-digit territory every chance it gets. It's so bad that at times the game actually becomes nauseating, even if you're not the type to get that sensation from games. As if that weren't enough to ruin the driving aspects of the game, the steering controls make matters significantly worse. They were already loose enough on consoles, but the PSP version is 10 times as squirrelly. There's nothing even remotely resembling actual physics here. When you wreck into an object, your car will start doing the electric slide for several feet before spinning around for no reason whatsoever, or it will just dead stop with no reaction or movement. And that's with the same object. Simply trying to steer around turns is equally unpredictable. Sometimes you'll start sliding around like crazy, and sometimes your tires will play like they're glued to the street. There's no rhyme or reason to any of it. Making Pimp My Ride any form of a driving game seems like a bad idea to begin with, and when you consider how bad the driving mechanics are, that decision seems even more ill-advised. And if for some reason these problems aren't enough to completely sink the game for you, how about having the game crash on you on a semi-regular basis while loading or autosaving, thus corrupting and killing your save file? That ought to do it.     Even apart from this port's specific and mind-blowing flaws, nothing about the game's progression makes any sense, nor is it any fun. When you're driving around trying to earn money, you're limited to a specific section of Pimp City but can take part in specific events around the map for which there are a few icons. When you go to a ghost-riding event, you take part in an idiot-simple rhythm minigame that isn't all that rhythmic. You just press a displayed sequence of buttons as quickly as you can for each stage of the game, and all the while, your dude dances alongside the car like all those horribly awesome Internet videos you and your buddies used to think were hilarious but stopped caring about back when it was still 2006. There's also a hot steppin' event, but in actuality, that's just a new name for yet another ghost-riding event. You have to press buttons with a different sense of timing--but that's it. The worst part about the ghost-riding games is that they never change. The game slowly and surely tries to ramp up the difficulty, but it does it so slowly that you'll barely even notice. The game can't even be bothered to change the hip-hop beat that plays behind you--it's the same beat every time.     The other minigame, cruising, is almost not worth mentioning, except that it's so hysterically stupid. You drive up to a group of gawking hip-hop kids, holding down a button to put your car into 10mph cruise mode. As you drive by, you press a quick series of buttons to send the kids into some kind of spastic frenzy and earn yourself some cash. That's it. It's even less fun in practice than it sounds on paper.     As you keep driving around, you'll also be wrecking into other cars and various billboards, which earns you cash for some weird reason. Eventually, you'll earn enough cash to meet the budget for your next customer. You then drive to the customer and a cutscene pops up that is similar to the sort of sequence you'd see on the TV show: a squealing 19-year-old girl with a horrid car and a heart of gold. Xzibit makes fun of the car for a while, and you're treated to some truly atrocious voice acting from the kids. Finally, you get the keys, and the pimping can begin. Of course, the pimping isn't all it's cracked up to be because the catch is that there's a rival pimper of rides out there competing with you on every job. When you get a car to work on, your rival gets the same car. So you and the other driver drive around the city under a time limit, trying to get to as many part suppliers as possible. The car with the highest rating at the end wins.     It sounds neat and all, but there's almost nothing to it. When you get to a part supplier, you get to choose from several different types of parts, some of which are very expensive and some of which are not. The trouble is that there's no reason not to pick the most expensive parts every single time. The most expensive parts translate into bigger boosts to your meter, and you're never hurting for cash. Sometimes you can choose from multiple types of parts that cost the same, especially when it comes to the crazy custom parts the show is known for (a trunk-mounted anvil for an aspiring metal worker or an in-bed tattoo parlor for the pickup truck of an apprentice tattoo artist), but you never get to use or experience those parts. You can drive around the cars you pimp, but you don't do anything with them except travel from place to place or engage in the occasional bout of ghost riding. There's no reason to put much thought into the ride-pimping aspect of the game, beyond picking the most expensive part and deciding which part shop you can get to most quickly.     The single, solitary thing that Pimp My Ride had going for it on consoles was its presentation, and in the PSP version, that one feather in its cap has been removed, tossed to the ground, and stomped upon with golf cleats until it's shredded, tattered, and unrecognizable. The problems go well beyond the broken frame rate. As you might expect, the graphics have been scaled back considerably from the console versions of Pimp My Ride, and that might not be such a terrible thing except that because of the frame rate, you're often getting what equates to still-frame looks at every ugly texture. The pimped rides still have a bit of aesthetic appeal, but that isn't nearly enough to make up for every other sin this game commits visually.        The game's audio has remained mostly unmolested from the console versions of Pimp My Ride, save for some skipping problems that pop up when the UMD loads in the background. Those issues aside, the audio isn't bad. Xzibit does a good job with the less-than-stellar dialogue that has been written for him. This is less true of other voice actors, but at least X has a bit of fun with what is a pretty silly concept. You can almost hear him snicker as he explains the rules of Pimp City. There's also a decent roster of songs on the soundtrack, many of which are from Xzibit's new album. The soundtrack could have used a bit more variety, but what's there is mostly quality stuff.     Oh, did we mention the 45- to 60-second load times that crop up every time you need to load a minigame, a cutscene, or any other aspect of the game, even if you're replaying something you just played? Considering all of the other horrible problems Pimp My Ride has, crummy load times almost seem moot by comparison. While you might not expect a whole lot from a quick-and-dirty port of a lame console game, there is a reasonable expectation that the port not be completely apathetic and half-baked to the point of being unplayable. There is no version of Pimp My Ride worth recommending to anyone, but the PSP version is definitely the one that should be most actively avoided.  "
1245,Titanfall 2,9.0,2,"As with the first game from Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 revolves around two layers of combat: conventional firefights between human combatants, and clashes between massive bipedal mechs. As a boots-on-the-ground pilot, Titanfall 2 feels more like a traditional shooter--albeit one with pristine controls and a fluid traversal system. The first Titanfall sparked the trend of shooters focused on movement, and with its sequel, the series reestablishes its place at the head of the pack. The loop of sliding, double jumping, vaulting a ledge, and running along a wall to flank an enemy feels invigorating and intuitive.Then it comes time to call in your mechanical ally from orbit, and everything changes when it hits the ground. Because it's when these two layers engage in a tug-of-war that Titanfall 2 reveals its true brilliance. What was once an even fight becomes a David versus Goliath scenario: a pilot rushes to cover, fires off a rocket, glides along a nearby wall, avoids a missile salvo from her robotic opponent, activates her cloaking device, and enters a nearby ravine to order a Titan of her own.This sequence is intense, but in Titanfall 2, it's commonplace. Momentum often shifts as one team gains control of the battlefield, only to lose ground when the other notices a weak spot, and attacks it.This is crucial in Titanfall 2. Now more than ever, combat requires forethought and intelligence. Humans may be careening across the map with grapple hooks, while phase-warping ninja mechs cut through laser-powered robot warriors--but beneath all of this is a hidden nuance. Despite the bombast and spectacle, Titanfall 2 is a thinking person's shooter.The sequel's new Titans embody this sentiment. In place of the basic light, medium, and heavy variants from the first game, Titanfall 2 employs six distinct walking battle tanks with arsenals of their own. They're almost like superheroes: one attacks with a thermite launcher and flame attacks, while another fires a chest-mounted laser cannon at unlucky opponents.Each of the Titans' abilities are easy to learn, but difficult to master, as the saying goes. Their loadouts immediately make sense, and it's easy to see that Northstar's low armor and long-range railgun make her an ideal sniper--but new layers reveal themselves the more you play. Take Scorch, for example. His flame shield dissolves incoming projectiles, providing extra protection while he tries to back away from close-quarter engagements. But the flame shield has other uses: at one point, an enemy pilot came flying at me on a grappling hook. By igniting my fiery barrier, I melted him just as he came close to my cockpit.There are elements of fighting games or MOBAs here--each Titan has a tell, and a way to counter it.Learning the intricacies of each Titan is paramount not just for offense, but defense, too. Each mech has a distinct aesthetic, so as you round a corner and see a Ronin approaching you, you know to put distance between your Titan and the shotgun-toting enemy. There are elements of fighting games or MOBAs here--each Titan has a tell, and you only have a few brief moments to counter it to your advantage.The new Titans lend a very different pace to multiplayer matches. While the first Titanfall was always turned up to 11, so to speak, with smaller maps and cookie-cutter Titans focused on dealing damage, Titanfall 2 understands the value of breathing room. It doesn't burn you out with an onslaught of firefights--its maps are focused on exterior environments, and are often on the larger side, giving you time to plan out your attack with the intricate Titan loadouts. The plan may go awry, but it lends more weight to each enemy encounter. There's a sense of build-up as you approach a capture point, knowing full well which Titans occupy the area, and thinking through each step in your head.Each multiplayer mode is tailored to facilitate Titanfall 2's interwoven combat systems, but also to twist the formula in creative ways. Bounty Hunt is my favorite--you gain currency by killing the enemy team and AI grunts that litter the map, and at the end of each wave, you're given the option to deposit your loot in one of several banks. But here's the wrinkle: you have to leave your Titan in order to do so. What's more, clever players will camp near banks to pick off unsuspecting Pilots as they approach their goal. It's a frantic game of cat and mouse that increases in tension as the banks open and each team knows exactly what the other is doing, or trying to do.Then there's Last Titan Standing, a match that ends when the last mech is destroyed. It's the most methodical mode, as team members assess the enemy team composition and approach firefights carefully, considering there are no respawns. Pilot vs. Pilot eschews the titular robots, opting instead to focus on the fluid human against human combat--but even without its hulking behemoths, Titanfall 2 is frantic and exhilarating.That expert attention to pacing and momentum carries over into Titanfall 2's single-player mode as well. While the first Titanfall consigned its story to a specific story driven multiplayer playlist, the sequel places you in a discrete campaign with its own plot, characters, and set pieces. It follows Jack Cooper, a Militia rifleman-turned-pilot, and his sentient Titan BT-7274, as they battle the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation and the Apex Predator mercenary group.Unfortunately, the writing here is lacking. Your main enemies are outlandish villains, and the plot ends abruptly, before it feels like it should. And while there is often humor and sentiment to be found between Cooper and BT, the jokes become rote when they focus too much on the Titan's inability to understand human sayings and turns of phrase. There are moments where I felt a real connection to my Titan, and there is heart to be found throughout this story. But those moments are few and far betweenThe single-player campaign gradually increases in velocity and scope, coalescing in mid-air ship battles and frantic Titan charges.Yet in terms of design and pacing, the five-hour campaign is fantastic. It begins with a botched mission on the planet Typhon, and although it takes a little too much time to do anything out of the ordinary, the missions then increase in velocity and scope, coalescing in mid-air ship battles, frantic Titan charges, and old-school boss fights.These boss fights pit you against the other Titan variants, and as you progress through the missions, you'll unlock all of Titanfall 2's Titan loadouts, gaining the ability to swap between them on the fly. This grants the campaign a dynamism not entirely present in multiplayer. You can enter a battlefield, discern the situation, and choose a different Titan based on the scenario, all in the span of several seconds. Coupled with the quality of Titanfall 2's missions--my favorite plays with time in a way I won't spoil here--the ability to change Titans on the fly gives the campaign a pacing of its own.Titanfall 2 accomplishes several things. It introduces seemingly minor changes to its multiplayer sphere, but results in more fluid pacing and an intelligent gameplay loop. It adds a single-player campaign that builds in momentum with each mission, culminating in a grandiose battles that makes use of both Pilot and Titan combat.And lastly, Titanfall 2 demonstrates a vitality that its predecessor couldn't. Whereas the first Titanfall kept up its breakneck pace throughout the entirety of every match, Titanfall 2 understands that sometimes, dialing things back for a few moments can make the long run much more enjoyable. In many ways, Titanfall 2 feels like the game Respawn should have made in 2013. It's a fantastic sequel. It's a fluid shooter. It's a spectacular game."
3606,Omikron: The Nomad Soul,5.0,1,"Many developers have attempted to incorporate various styles of gaming into one package in an effort to create a game that is a unique interactive experience and can't be defined by a specific genre. Unfortunately, like most of the developers that have attempted this feat, Quatic Dream fails to accomplish this lofty goal in Omikron - but the failure is both commendable and miserable, depending on which facet of the game you're looking at.   Omikron is a bittersweet game to play, mostly because the early part of the game shows so much potential that it hurts to continually discover the game's damning faults as you progress. In the beginning, Omikron depicts a futuristic high-tech society with a spiritual edge - reminiscent of those in Flashback and Shadow Run - that is in peril. Early on, the mystery you are sent to solve seems incredibly interesting, as does the idea of exploring the game's vast 3D world, which is touted as one of the most interactive virtual environments ever.   The reality is that once the story of the game is established and you begin to explore the world of Omikron, the illusion of the game's living and breathing virtual world simply begins to crumble. You quickly realize that the city is little more than a polygonal prop, with a vast crew of mindless extras who all tell you that they're too busy to talk. There are only a handful of characters you can really interact with. Most of these exchanges are simple conversations that explain pieces of the mystery you're trying to solve. During these exchanges, you're given the ability to select various verbal responses. Based on the selections you choose, you trigger other questions and comments from the character. These conversations are cleverly disguised as dynamic conversations with virtual people in a virtual world. However, if you play through the game a second time and choose other topics and questions, you will see that the vast majority of these selections actually have little or no bearing on the course or outcome of the conversation. This devious little fact aside, the game's story and pacing are good enough to keep you fairly interested in the development of the story.   So what's happening? A series of bizarre murders has mystified the futuristic cops of Omikron, and it's up to you to unravel the mystery of the murders. Most of this is done from a standard third-person adventure perspective, which is followed by a camera that alternates between Resident Evil-style fixed camera angles and a behind-the-back, Tomb Raider-esque view. While the adventure style of play is the predominant style in the game, the action changes to a fighting-game format at key points, requiring you to show a little dexterity with the controller. For instance, when a confrontation with a wanted man turns sour, the camera view changes to a side view, and the game becomes a pseudo-fighting game, complete with life bars and special moves. Unfortunately, this game mode is extremely limited and lets you deliver only a small number of combos and moves. What's worse is that there's an easily discovered technique in this mode that lets you win each and every fight. Once you learn this technique, this fighting-game mode becomes incredibly predictable and boring - which is also a very accurate description of the first-person shooting mode that pops up from time to time. Neither of these action sequences lasts for more than a few moments, yet they still become incredibly repetitive because there's never really any danger of dying in either mode.   The game kind of just chugs along - there is a lot to do, and by all standards it's quite a long game. The control is adequate, but none of its play elements are satisfying. Some of the puzzle-solving logic that the game requires isn't very intuitive, which makes it almost necessary to look at a game guide for help.   Graphically, Omikron is a very impressive-looking game. The city is vast and is very detailed. The only real visual problem the game has occurs when lots of vehicles and pedestrians are all on the screen at once, causing the frame rate to drop significantly. When you interact with characters up close, the detail of the 3D models is evident in the characters' faces and in their decent attempts to lip-synch their lines. In all, the game has a good deal of eye candy, including flying cars, a strip club, and nice lighting effects.       In the sound department, Omikron has a wonderful soundtrack that consists largely of original music created by David Bowie for the game. The sound effects are decent, although the audio as a whole is suspiciously quiet throughout most of the game.        In the end, when you take all of Omikron's various parts and add them together, the game doesn't amount to much. The game's attempt to integrate multiple styles of play just doesn't work, since each individual piece is terrible when compared with other games from the respective genres. The game's intriguing story is simply hampered by all the design flaws, which make playing the game a little too frustrating and downright pointless at times."
1718,Grow Home,8.0,2," To assess Grow Home in a vacuum is to trip over the compliments that spill forth. The game's colorful island, cute creatures, and the planet's ambient sounds are immediately charming. You explore this world as BUD, a robot on a quest to retrieve seeds for a plant that can re-oxygenate his home world. To do this, BUD climbs the giant ""Star Plant"" stalk, occasionally taking control of its quick-growing branches and driving them head first into the glowing islands in the sky. The Star Plant sucks out the green glow, and then grows a little bigger. It's all very cute (and a little, uh, phallic). Grow Home is a strikingly beautiful game, especially in motion. Everything hums with bright, colorful life. Through its use of cel-shading, low-polygon models, and subtle environmental animation, Grow Home builds a gorgeous, minimalistic style. And then, as the stalk and its branches sprout up through the sky, Grow Home sets that minimalism against overwhelming scale. Beauty is everywhere: You can let your sight linger on the butterflies, or you can look upwards, to the towering Star Plant reaching into the upper atmosphere.  While the environments shine, BUD is the real star attraction. His bobbing head, wide smile, and eager chirps make him lovable, but it's the way he moves through the world that makes controlling him such a joy. BUD's animation is procedural: instead of having the frames of his movement handcrafted by an animator, the developers programmed a system for BUD's limbs to animate according to the player's input. You direct BUD around the world with the left analog stick, using the left and right triggers to control his hands, which can grip anything they touch. As you try to deal with the quirks of BUD's unpredictable movement, the result, at first, is a sort of comedic flailing. This was never frustrating for me, but I can see how it might be for others. Maybe you misjudge the amount of momentum BUD will have as he lands on one of the ""branches"" of the massive stalk, and wind up flinging him thousands of feet down to his demise. Or you might think you've got a firm grip on the cliff face, only to find that you've actually grabbed onto a loose boulder. Whoops. You can supplement your control of BUD with some environmental tools: springy plants give you a way to boost BUD's jumping power, while flowers and leaves work as parachutes and hang gliders. But these often lead to other stumbles. Pro tip: if you crash into anything while floating around with that leaf, you lose hold of it and go into a headfirst dive. Whoops, again. This is all reminiscent of games like Octodad and Sumotori Dreams, both of which leverage uncontrollable bodies for the sake of humor. But unlike these games, there comes a point in Grow Home where you attain a sense of control that feels both elegant and exuberant. BUD's body never becomes Ezio Auditore's--it always bounces and leans in unpredictable ways. But Grow Home isn't a game about laughing at atypical bodies. Instead, it's a game that lets you become familiar with limbs that don't quite work like your own do, and it teaches you to take joy in using tools to augment your natural abilities. I invoked the name of Ezio because the second way I experienced Grow Home was in the context of Ubisoft's recent offerings. For Ubisoft, 2014 was a year of too safe (and often too broken) output. Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed: Unity were technical disappointments, and, worse, failed to mix up the increasingly tired open-world formula common to Ubi's tent-pole releases. The Crew tried to apply that formula to a whole new genre, and in doing so missed a chance to do something really special. And while Far Cry 4 was well received, the common refrain was ""It's more Far Cry 3."" It's easy to imagine how Grow Home's vision of climbing-and-collecting might fit into the familiar open-world Ubisoft blueprint. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a version of this new climbing model eventually finds its way into an Assassin's Creed sequel. But Grow Home never falls into the design traps that show up in other recent Ubisoft titles. Yes, you do search for collectible crystals, but these aren't carelessly scattered by the hundreds across the environment. They're placed carefully, to encourage exploration and to challenge you to understand how BUD moves. And yes, these crystals unlock new abilities (such as a jetpack!), but these upgrades aren't doled out along a carefully scheduled arc to maximize your attachment to the game. If you prefer the sensory overload of those aforementioned games, you might find yourself disappointed with Grow Home's lack of density. Sometimes you spend a few minutes plotting a course across the sky to a hovering island in the distance, only to find it empty but for a hidden crystal and a small collection of plants. Grow Home does not provide you a screen filled with side objectives and a constant stream of narrative reinforcement: It is happy to let you take your time, to meander, to move at your own pace for the few hours it takes to finish it. And while you might see its ""short"" length as a negative, it's Grow Home's brevity that lets it shine. No game exists in a vacuum, and sometimes it's hard to confront the contexts that color our experiences, especially when they make us second guess ourselves. Is Grow Home a charming game that's worth your time? Yes. Do I believe this because Grow Home contrasts so sharply with Ubisoft's recent output? Also yes. Yet no matter how prone to cynicism you may be, you shouldn’t let this surprising gem go unnoticed."
1277,Batman: The Telltale Series,6.0,1,"Although Bruce and his crime-fighting alter ego might get the most screen time, Oswald Cobblepot is the focal point of this episode. Oz was a childhood friend of Bruce’s, but his family fell on hard times, so he fled Gotham and turned to a life of crime. Upon his return he spoke of an impending revolution. The sparks of that revolution ignite in episode two.Telltale does a good job of presenting Oswald as a complicated character. His actions are undoubtedly villainous--which shouldn't come as a surprise, given he is the Penguin--but revelations about the downfall of the Cobblepots begets Oz some well-deserved sympathy. You’ll never quite root for him over Batman, but when his justifications are revealed it becomes easier to understand what’s driving him. Despite this, Penguin isn’t charismatic as a villain. He schemes and grandstands, but it’s never in a way that’s thrilling to watch. Thankfully, episode two alludes to there being a bigger, badder villain behind the scenes.Episode two is also about Bruce Wayne's father, Thomas Wayne, whose deepest, darkest secrets are laid bare for all to see. What you learn about him would be more shocking if TV show Gotham hadn’t just used a very similar plot, so in that respect Telltale’s series isn’t treading new ground, but it does place Bruce in a much harsher light. As a result, the dynamics of some of his relationships change. For Harvey Dent, who was banking on the wholesome Wayne name to propel his mayoral campaign, his friendship with Bruce becomes a liability. There’s a growing tension between the two characters, which Telltale effectively harnesses when asking you to make decisions. It creates situations where lashing out at Harvey would be understandable, but knowing it could have big consequences going forward may stay your hand.The shift in Bruce’s relationship with Alfred, meanwhile, is more subtle. In episode one, Alfred is the voice of dissent. He repeatedly warns Bruce about being Batman and dissuades him from his vigilante activities. However, after some hard truths about Alfred are exposed, he changes his tune slightly. He’s more supportive, even telling Bruce that the city “needs” Batman.This could simply be because he needs to show faith in Batman so Bruce can deal with the dangers facing Gotham. But given what Bruce learns about him, it also feels like Alfred is trying to recover some lost respect. Or perhaps he’s seeing the Wayne identity being corroded and is pushing Bruce into seeking solace in a new persona. For the most part Telltale’s Alfred embodies the faithful butler archetype, but there are shades of something more there which I hope are explored further.Unfortunately, there [aren't many] memorable moments that make you feel like the World's Greatest DetectiveThe results of your decisions in episode one also start to reveal themselves in Children of Arkham, but none are significant. It’s mostly whether you’re friendly with Vicki Vale or Jim Gordon, based on who you turned the evidence over to in the last episode. Or what Gotham thinks of Batman after the confrontation with Carmine Falcone. If Telltale’s previous games are any indications, these are all part of larger web of consequences the studio is spinning, and episode two adds a few more threads: do you interrogate a prominent Gothamite as Batman, which is the path of least resistance, but could turn the city against you. Or do you use Bruce Wayne’s guile, which is tougher but will keep Jim Gordon on your side.Both of these will no doubt have a knock-on effects, but they’re not decisions to fret over. In fact, there’s really only one moment in episode two that will give you pause. I played through the game twice and the first time around the result of my choice in that moment felt inconsequential. The second time, however, the impact of my decision was profound, so I'd recommend switching to another save slot and experiencing both branches of the story. Other than this moment, episode two is made up of a series of small choices that, while bereft of weight in the moment, also feel like dominoes being stacked next to each other.While Children of Arkham pushes the story forward, it takes a step back in gameplay. The crime-scene investigation which was key to making Telltale’s game feel like a well-rounded Batman experience is missing from episode two. This time around, there’s no mystery to unravel, as all the investigations are simply a matter of clicking a series of interaction points.At the start of the episode Bruce returns to Crime Alley to find a new angle on the murder of his parents. Given our experience picking apart a simulated crime scene in the past, the fact that there’s no puzzle to solve here is a real wasted opportunity. Instead we get yet another straight retelling of the Wayne murder with some commentary from Bruce.The closest episode two gets to making you feel like a detective is when you have to triangulate a phone signal, which involves moving a drone around a map until an on-screen indicator goes green--hardly detective work. Unfortunately, there are no other memorable moments that’ll make you feel like the World's Greatest Detective. This is a shame, because the crime scene investigation in episode one was a satisfying way of mixing the tropes of a point-and-click adventure game while staying true to Batman as a character.The puzzle-like combat sequence from episode one makes a return. During a debate between Harvey Dent and incumbent mayor Hamilton Hill, Batman and Catwoman team up to bring down a squad of armed thugs. You have to study your targets, identify potential weapons in your environment, and execute a series of attacks. This is still a clever way to represent Batman’s foresight and battle prowess, but without the crime scene investigation--and amongst all the QTE sections--it also serves to highlight the lack of gameplay variety in episode two.Anyone expecting Telltale to continue deconstructing Bruce Wayne and his alter ego will come away from Children of Arkham unsatisfied. It effectively lays the groundwork for future events with the help of a few unexpected twists, but in leaving out meaningful detective work, it falls short of the series' first episode."
1582,The Red Solstice,7.0,2,"If you try to move through the map too fast, you'll die. Go too slow? You'll die. Stray away from your team or stay too close to your buddy? Dead and dead. If you want to survive The Red Solstice, a top-down shooter with an emphasis on tactics, you need to adapt quickly to new situations. Even then, you should probably prepare yourself to die a lot. The Red Solstice is not very welcoming to newcomers, especially if you try to jump directly into multiplayer (something the game itself advises against). Its core gameplay isn't too hard to grasp--it controls like a real-time strategy game in which you have only a single soldier or small handful of units. Right-clicking moves your soldier(s) to a location, left-clicking orders them to attack, each unit has a variety of skills (each with its own cooldowns), and you have a limited inventory of items. But there is a lot of depth beneath these basics, and if you try to treat The Red Solstice as a pure action game, you will struggle to succeed. You can slow the action down to a crawl with a tap of the button, giving you some extra seconds to breathe and plan your next move. This slow-mo tactical mode is only available when playing solo, but making good use of it is imperative for single-player success. Sure, you could try running through the map with auto-aim turned on so all your squad members automatically pivot toward and attack incoming threats, but that's a recipe for inaccurate shots and wasted ammo, neither of which you can afford if you want to make it out alive. One of the key elements of The Red Solstice is that it's class-based, and having a balanced squad of various classes is essential. This goes beyond the obvious ""Take a medic with you so you can heal yourself"" strategy in that each class has a variety of available skills that can make the difference between success and failure. Using the right support skill at the right time could save lives, and most classes have weaknesses that make it difficult for them to survive alone. For instance, the long-range specialty of the Marksman might be great for picking off enemies from afar, but they'll struggle if swarmed by a large group at close range. On the other hand, your Heavy Support soldier might be tank-like when it comes to holding a position, but they won't be fast enough to efficiently run around the map checking for items or turning on power generators. A good team needs diversity. The concept of a team should be stressed here. Even the best soldiers aren't likely to survive long alone, so sticking close to friendly units and using each class's unique abilities is vital. A good squad can plan ahead for a wave of enemies by setting up traps and turrets and making sure everybody has spare bullets. A lone wolf will get swarmed by enemies, run out of ammo, get backed into a corner, and die, not necessarily in that order. Simply sticking together isn't all it takes to succeed, though, and repeated failures can be frustrating. This is especially true as you deal with the infrequent checkpoints in the single-player campaign (which often force you to take long walks and fight through big groups over and over again) or die as you realize for the first time that grenades and rockets inexplicably seem to go through walls. A lot of little problems like these can add up to an unpleasant experience, but they're easier to get through with friends. The game's focus (and where it shines most) is its multiplayer. If controlling a small squad of units in the single-player game feels like StarCraft, the multiplayer feels more like Diablo. Multiplayer is a co-op experience for up to eight players in which you only control one character. As you play, you'll earn experience points so you can go up in both level and rank, allowing you to unlock new classes, abilities, and weapons to use in your next game. There's a light story in the multiplayer campaign, but the bigger draw is that each time you play a map, the experience is unlikely to be the same as the last time you played. Beyond a selection of game variables the game's host can toggle before a match (tweaking things like the amount of time between enemy wave spawns or increasing the number of bosses you'll encounter), each deployment onto a map is somewhat randomized. The geometry of the location stays the same (though maps are large, so there is a lot to explore), but the enemies you'll encounter and the missions you'll receive are dynamic. These missions usually boil down to standard tasks like ""kill all the enemies in this area"" or ""search this body for some information,"" but it's nice to have their order and location shuffled around every game so completing them doesn't become too rote. Like most co-op multiplayer experiences, The Red Solstice is best with friends. If you have none (or you just want a challenge), you can play the game's ""Survival"" mode, which is essentially the multiplayer mode except you control a handful of AI units to make up for the missing human players. It can be fun, but there's a genuine sense of camaraderie when playing online with a solid group of four to eight people, and the solo experience can't replicate that. If you try to treat The Red Solstice as a pure action game, you will struggle to succeed. It can also be good to hop online and try to find some experienced players willing to show you the ropes, especially because you aren't likely to learn them all without some help. Even after playing through all 10 missions of the single-player campaign, I felt that the game never communicated some things to me--at least not well. For example, I did not know you could pick up (and then toss) exploding barrels until I saw another player do it online. This bit of knowledge would have made one specific section of a single-player mission, in which I needed to blow up some barricades, a bit less frustrating. Getting to the center of the storm that is The Red Solstice isn't easy. A less-than-stellar tutorial and initial overload of information combined with a handful of quirks and bugs make it a game you have to stick with for a little while before you can fully appreciate its depth. If you can reach that point, though, and you have some friends to reach it with, this a storm you will successfully weather."
3515,Armored Core: Last Raven,5.0,1,"           A lot of success in this game comes from trial and error, and not just from armored core battles. There are some recon, escort, and defense missions as well, and quite a few of them are likely to stump you at first until you realize that you have to go back to the garage and tune some parts. For instance, one early mission calls for you to eliminate threats around a pair of bridges so that your forces can advance. The bridge you start on is blown out, and so you must boost your way across the gap. The grunt on the other side will always pelt you with weak fire, but it's just enough to knock you away from your path before you can fully cross. It's highly improbable that your mech will ever make it across the gap until you realize that the only solution is to buy a more powerful booster (or a switch your robot legs out for a limbless hover mechanism).     Despite its maddening gameplay, Last Raven Portable retains that esoteric appeal common among all Armored Core games whereby you can spend dozens of hours just playing around with your mech configuration. It's unfortunate that no concessions were made to this port to make it more accessible because Armored Core: Formula Front did so by including an auto-battle option (which, when activated, put the emphasis squarely on the customization aspect). If you're an Armored Core fan who has been following its portable entries with gusto, you may feel right at home and will likely be encouraged to take down every enemy armored core in the game's virtual arena and complete every mission to see every ending. On the other hand, if you just really, really like giant robots and want to see things explode on a portable platform, you won't want to start with this Armored Core game.  "
2671,Tropico 4,6.0,1,"Tropico 4 has been dragged into the future with Modern Times, an expansion that moves the Banana Republic simulation into today's high-tech world of cell phones and Facebook. But ditching the golden age of Caribbean dictators doesn't work out too well, due to a boring campaign that relies far too much on phony obstacles to make the same-old, same-old challenges play out any differently than in last year's game. Instead of revamping your life as a tropical tyrant, the expansion recycles the core concepts that powered both Tropico 3 and 4, making for a tedious, vaguely irritating experience for all but diehard fans of the franchise.        An all-new solo campaign forms the heart of Modern Times. You get 12 lengthy scenarios (expect at least 20 hours of play) spread among the numerous tropical islands that make up El Presidente's Latin American fiefdom. There's a new story about the big guy battling a mysterious cabal called The Conclave that is instilling chaos across the globe, but the challenge remains the same as it always has in the Tropico series. So you build the same little nations, plant the same farms, dig the same mines, suck up to the same powers-that-be in the USA and USSR, and appease the same mix of battling island factions. The goal is to stay on top of an unstable seesaw, keeping the citizens just happy enough with their miserable lives to not revolt and kill you.     Instead of being stuck in the good old days of Kennedy, Khrushchev, and pals, however, the expansion moves from the '60s through the current day. By the second mission, you're into the 1990s and able to build modern apartments, bio farms, fish farms, borehole mines, and telecom offices to enhance cell phone range. You even get to mess around with a space program in the later scenarios, which take you into the 21st century. Edicts embrace the modern age, too. Ten new orders for El Presidente let you ban social media like Facebook and Twitter, toss some money at China for 100 instant immigrants, reform the healthcare system, and even throw a Festival of Love that sends women into the streets to kick off a baby boom and entice tourists.        New buildings give the game a face-lift, but in many scenarios the old mingles with the new so much that the expansion comes off as something like a half-there mod that changes some of the setting but not all of it. This results in an odd mix of techs and times that give the game a Neverland atmosphere where space shuttles exist alongside dirt farms and shotgun shacks. A lot of new goals are structured around the modern building options, at least. The main theme here is, not surprisingly, modernization. So the armory you built back in the '70s gets replaced by the ominous SWAT HQ in the '90s. The old concrete apartment blocks of the '60s are bulldozed for nicer and almost avant-garde contemporary replacements, complete with helipads on their roofs.      Meanwhile, traditional farms go out of vogue and are replaced by bio options that produce multiple types of crops simultaneously. Some advancements are simple swaps and some are more esoteric, such as solar farms making wind turbines obsolete and the metro coming in as the modern take on the garage. But nothing really changes how you play. Building your island paradise remains the same, and you need to only slightly alter your strategies to embrace some of the new buildings. Much of the time you don't even need to do much, since the new are straight-up swaps for the old, with only cosmetic differences marking one from another.        Modern edicts don't add much, either. They are grouped in a tab of their own, which is pretty convenient since you spend the majority of your time never even looking at them. Edicts from the core game are far more useful than the gimmicky options here. Blocking access to the likes of Twitter sounds interesting, but it doesn't much over over the secret police options of the good old days.      Get Smart's KAOS, with all sorts of kooky plots ranging from bioengineered hiccupping diseases to cloned human beings. Scenarios lurch around in such bizarre ways that you never know the difference between a smart move and a dumb one that will bankrupt the treasury. So, do you give that Tricky Dick look-alike $50,000 to spill the beans? Is it worth buying off the CIA with a yacht? Will building the bungee jump for the mad professor really stop all that damned hiccupping?         Everything is so strange that you can never tell at any given moment what you need to do to emerge victorious. Even worse, scenarios are often dragged out with extra busywork. In the hiccup mission, for example, your mad scientist advisor hits you with one crazy expensive demand after another, like the aforementioned bungee jump, a roller coaster, and water filtration plants. You know they're mostly nonsense, but you still have to go through the motions for a good two or three hours to bring it all to a close.     Missions also rely on flat-out cheats, such as random events and constant crises that instantly destroy buildings, send resource values plummeting, and deplete your treasuries. You constantly battle with natural disasters and foreign economic pressures like runs on your currency that can cut the value of your cash by two-thirds instantly. Granted, this sort of thing has been done in Tropicos past. But Modern Times revs things up so much, courtesy of its zany ""world gone mad"" storyline, that you constantly keep guessing and reacting to sudden shifts in the economic landscape. Still, there are just enough challenging additions to keep you interested…if you were a fan of Tropico 4 or are a masochist who can't get enough of volcanoes destroying that hugely expensive chemical plant you just built after two years of saving. Those looking for more of the same with a little something extra in terms of difficulty and frustration will likely stay interested, if not enthralled, for the duration of the campaign.        Bugs are another issue for a fair number of Modern Times players. Just starting the game might be impossible, due to problems with an Nvidia video driver that causes crashes on startup. Updating to the most current video driver might partially help, but only at the lowest graphical settings: changing the resolution may cause an instant crash to the desktop. Bug problems seem to be fairly widespread; the problems began with the recent Tropico 4 updates, and didn't exist in the original release.      Little flaws exist within the add-on, as well. Sometimes you are given goals that cannot be completed because they involve technology or buildings that have yet to be invented. Miss Pineapple has a tendency to ask for that telecom building to improve her cell phone's range a good decade before cell phones were on the open market, for example. Objectives sometimes do not clear even after they have been completed. If you do the Communists' bidding and issue the new Fertilize! edict, the objective might just stay on the main screen long after the choppers have sprayed everything down. And there are a few fit-and-finish problems, too, such as secret police wearing miner helmets in building info screens.        Despite the promise held by moving Tropico 4 past its ""been there, done that"" Cold War setting, Modern Times is about as annoying as the CIA was to Fidel Castro back in the 1970s, with all of their out-there assassination plots like the one with exploding cigars. The campaign wears out its welcome fast by repeating virtually all of the tasks that you faced in the last two Tropico games, albeit with minor face-lifts like groovier apartment buildings and organic cattle ranching. With that said, the core of the game is based on an addictive concept with some lingering appeal held over from the past two games. So fans of the franchise can still find themselves sucked into spending a few more hours in the presidential palace, even while realizing that so much more could have been done with this concept.     "
3586,Elevator Action,5.0,1,"  While it was groundbreaking for its time and is considered a classic arcade game, Elevator Action has always been one of those games that either hooks you or leaves you confused as to why anyone would waste more than a single quarter to play it. The game had you making your way to the bottom of a skyscraper while shooting and kicking gangsters in black suits. The mature premise and then-innovative gunplay enticed many people to slide a quarter into the arcade cabinet or to purchase a cartridge for play at home. Unfortunately, the honeymoon was short-lived for some players. The act of descending the same building over and over and repeatedly shooting the same bad guys could sap a person's attention span in about five minutes. Now that the NES version of Elevator Action is available for the Wii's Virtual Console, a whole new generation can experience this game that people either love or hate.        In the game, you play the part of a secret agent named Otto. Otto's job is to infiltrate a tall building from the roof and descend its 30 floors looking for documents located behind randomly placed red doors. The game gets its name from the many elevators you have to ride on as you make your way down to the ground floor. As you move from floor to floor, mobsters in black suits will appear out of ordinary doors and try to shoot you. You can duck under or jump over their shots, but the best way to deal with the bad guys is to shoot back or hit them in the face with Otto's feet as you jump toward them. You'll also quickly discover that you can crush the bad guys by luring them underneath elevators or shooting the light fixtures above their heads.      From its description, Elevator Action seems like a varied action romp with a James Bond flavor. In reality, there's not much to it. Riding elevators isn't very interesting, shooting the same bad guys gets old fast, and the puzzle aspect of having to navigate multiple elevators at the bottom of the building doesn't liven things up much. Each level is also basically the same. The background colors change and another red door is added to each subsequent level, but the building layout never changes. Furthermore, since the game was originally produced in 1983, the graphics and audio reflect that era. Everything is crisp and well defined, but the 2D characters are blocky and the animation is choppy. The sound effects, meanwhile, are rudimentary pings and crunching noises, and the music is an insidious ditty that loops every 10 seconds or so. Some people argue, however, that the game's shortcomings are really its strengths. The blocky visuals do have a certain charm, and dodging bullets and escaping the building in each level can be mesmerizing, in much the same way that Pac-Man is, if you're into racking up high scores.     As far as the emulation quality is concerned, the Wii emulates the NES version of Elevator Action perfectly. The graphics are clean, the audio seems right, and the Wii Remote is a good substitute for the rectangular NES controller. At first glance, the colors may appear to be drab or washed out, but that's actually how the NES version looks compared to the original arcade game. Most people prefer the NES port anyway, because the characters and bullets don't move at a snail's pace as they do in the arcade cabinet.     Considering how polarizing a piece of software Elevator Action was in its heyday, it stands to reason that the effect would be magnified by significant levels some 20-odd years later. It's only 500 Wii points ($5), but even that seems like a hefty price to pay for such an archaic game.    "
4417,The Guild 2: Venice,4.0,0,"  The Guild 2: Venice is a stand-alone expansion that purports to be all about the legendary sinking city best known for its canals and singing gondoliers, but it's actually just a third-rate face-lift of its predecessors. The only noteworthy additions to this economic simulation are a couple of new professions, four new scenarios depicting Venice and its neighbors on the Adriatic Sea, and some horrific bugs. So even if you're hungry for more merchant-on-merchant action after the original game and its Pirates of the High Seas add-on, you don't need to take this Venetian holiday.     If you played any prior Guild 2 games, you'll find the gameplay here very familiar. You once more sign on as one of four medieval classes and work at making money, building RPG-like skills, and going forth and procreating to establish a multigenerational dynasty. That description makes the game sound a little more far-ranging than it actually is, however. Instead of a role-playing medieval adventure, you're actually playing a merchant in a humdrum real-time economic sim. The patron, craftsman, scholar, and rogue classes may allow you to take on a wide range of occupations that stretch all the way from priest to highwayman, but each deals with nearly identical buy-and-sell busywork. As a priest, for instance, you set up a church and make your daily bread by selling holy water and the sacrament. On the other end of the moral spectrum as a rogue, you do pretty much the same thing, although you take a shortcut to wealth by stealing items that you later sell. All of the lines of work here seem just about identical, with similar goals that mainly revolve around buying raw materials and turning them into finished goods dished out for a profit. Basically, you're playing a medieval workshop boss, with all of the thrills and chills that such a job entails.        About the only difference between this expansion pack and the previous Guild 2 games is that you're now plying your trade in Venice instead of northern Europe. Changes are so superficial that it can be hard to even notice them. About the only difference between this expansion pack and the previous Guild 2 games is that you're now plying your trade in Venice instead of northern Europe. The lagoon-based city and its neighbors such as Trieste and Ravenna are depicted as being waterlogged, which generates a lot of atmosphere in comparison with the blah northern European maps in the original Guild 2. The canals in Venice really set this backdrop apart from those in the earlier games, although the way that city neighborhoods are spread across tiny islands connected by narrow bridges makes the map layouts feel almost puzzlelike. A lot of tedious scrolling around is required to find specific buildings. Trieste is even more of a pain to navigate, due to it being scattered over even dinkier islands connected by narrow, half-submerged roads. This city looks more like it could be found in the Florida Keys, not along the coast of the Adriatic.     Pathfinding is awful, too, and the number of roads so limited that you can never guide a character directly from one place to another. You need to head west a lot of the time to go north, east to go south, and so forth. Even worse, your characters move so slowly that they might as well be running underwater, while NPCs race around. Even people that you're in the process of successfully wooing tend to just take off and run away from you at a moment's notice. This forces you to either break it off and pick up with someone less fleet-footed, or run after your intended and hope he or she takes a breather at some point before you lap the entire town.     The constricted map design also restricts building possibilities, especially in Trieste. Lots are so tightly packed that it can be tough to find enough space for the game's generally large structures. You typically have to do a fair bit of scrolling across the landscape in order to find a spot big enough to accommodate something like a cathedral or even a smuggler's den. Perhaps this is a realistic concession to the watery landscape of Venice and the surrounding region, although these building restrictions just seem annoying from a gameplay perspective. Bugs cause even more problems with building placement. The tutorial mission on building purchase and setup cannot be completed because there is no place big enough to put the foundry that it requires. Since you have to finish each tutorial to keep going, this little problem nicely locks you out of the remaining primer missions (which is kind of a big deal since the game ships without a paper manual). Also, the ghost building outline routinely vanishes when you try to place structures, making it even harder to properly drop them onto the map. We have to wonder if anybody play-tested these maps before booting the game out the door.        And even though the general map terrain is vaguely Venice-like when it comes to the ""water, water everywhere"" shtick, the city itself looks very little like its canal-laden counterpart in real life. Most buildings appear to have been reskinned with new textures, but in a quickie fashion that leaves everything looking unfinished. Cheap homes now look like shotgun shacks thrown up with a few two-by-fours and some corrugated metal. Adding to this rough look is a lot of clipping. Characters routinely run through buildings and carts, and also tend to hang out half their bodies sticking into a wall or door. This at least makes the awful pathfinding a touch easier to deal with, but it gives the game a real shoddy look, especially when you're inside a building with lots of people, like a tavern, or have zoomed in to get a close-up look at city streets and see unemployed serfs loafing around with their legs buried in benches up to their knees. The camera doesn't seem to know where solid objects are, either, as it frequently gets jammed behind walls when it switches over to the letterboxed sequences depicting conversations, such as when you're courting a potential spouse. Just a few new iconic structures have been added to give Venice a distinct appearance, such as the Council Palace and the University of Venice, but most of these are inaccessible, and those that can be entered seem to reuse interiors from the earlier games. At any rate, the landscape here is nothing like the exciting domain of canals and carnivals promised on the box.     While we did experience a few crashes to desktop, always during political events like voting, we haven't experienced the hard crashes and corrupted saved games that have apparently plagued other users. Yet it's hard to really credit the game here, since these issues have been reported on many online message boards and have caused the publisher to hurry a patch into private beta development. So despite our dumb luck in at least partially dodging the bug bullet here, the game seems unstable enough in other areas that you should be sure to download a patch as soon as one shows up.     Any way you look at it, The Guild 2: Venice is pointless. It provides almost nothing new, includes none of the content in the original game or the first expansion, and even omits the multiplayer mode of play included in both of its predecessors. Instead of taking you for a ride on a gondola, all this expansion does is take you for a ride.    "
434,Genshin Impact,7.0,2,"When you hear the words ""free-to-play,"" you probably think of very specific kinds of games: mobile time-killers, first-person shooters with loot boxes, MMORPGs. However, a story-driven, open-world action-RPG in a similar vein to Zelda: Breath of the Wild is probably not what springs to mind. But that's exactly what Genshin Impact aims to be. It delivers a large, lore-filled, graphically lush world with nuanced combat, character-building, exploration mechanics, and co-op crossplay across multiple platforms at the most appealing price point possible--free! And while it succeeds admirably for the most part, it stumbles in a few key ways that remind you that there's no such thing as a fully free-to-play game.Genshin Impact makes a great first impression. The anime-inspired visuals are inviting and colorful, and the fully voiced, nicely choreographed cutscenes give the game the feel of a premium product. It also gets you going with the gameplay very quickly; thanks to solid control design, you'll be running, swimming, climbing, dodging, gliding, fighting slimes, and slinging spells just a few minutes after the intro cutscenes wrap up. And once your first additional party member officially joins your posse, things start to get very interesting, as you'll start to learn the ins and outs of the elemental interactions that make Genshin Impact unique.Each character in Genshin Impact has one of seven elemental properties tied to them, which greatly affects what they can do for combat and exploration. While systems of strong and weak elements are extremely common in games, Genshin Impact takes things a step further, introducing unique and interesting ways for multiple elements to interact with objects and enemies. It starts with simple interactions: an object aligned with Dendro (nature) like a wood shield or structure burns with damaging flames when exposed to Pyro attacks, while pools of water can be frozen with Cryo element skills or used as a conduit for causing Electro damage in an area. Experimenting with other elemental combinations will yield more interesting results; setting an enemy on fire and following up with an Electro attack overloads them with energy and causes area damage, while using a windstorm can blow another source of elemental damage like Pyro or Hydro elsewhere while augmenting its strength.You can swap between four active characters with a tap of the D-pad, giving you the ability to strategically chain attacks to great effect. The system makes party formation interesting: Do you double up on elements for bonuses or field a team of different elements, just in case you run across unexpected challenges and puzzles where they could be useful? It's a fun and creative system that adds a lot of enjoyment to exploring Genshin Impact's world, Teyvat.And there's plenty to do here, too. Even though many areas of Teyvat haven't been made available to explore yet, there's still plenty to do and see. There are chests to find, teleportation spots to activate, all kinds of raw materials to accumulate, side quests to complete, and big baddies to try and slay. If you want to stop exploring and relax a little, you can try your hand at cooking food, forging weapons, and even conjuring up rare items through alchemy. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can even explore certain dungeons with others online using co-op play--and, thanks to cross-platform compatibility, it's easy to join up with others no matter what they're playing on. Setting up elemental combos with a team of players is very satisfying indeed.You'll get more party characters, weapons, and loot as you play through the game normally, but there is a way to get some extra goodies: by opening up your wallet. [Editor's note: Everything written here refers to version 1.0 of the game. As Genshin Impact is an ongoing games-as-a-service title, monetization methods and drop rates can change as the game evolves.] Genshin Impact's monetization revolves primarily around ""gacha,"" a Japanese term referring to a loot box-style system. You spend in-game currency on a ""wish"" that will get you either a weapon or a new character, and buying 10 wishes at once guarantees a character or weapon of four-star or better rarity. While you can obtain said currency in-game for free in various ways, you can also buy it directly with real money. You can also use real money to buy upgrades like item sets or a Battle Pass that yields better rewards for your questing endeavors.Besides utilizing a confusing currency conversion system (you buy Genesis Crystals, which you can convert to Primogems, which you then convert to Fates to spend on Wishes), the gacha can be very punishing. If you're going for the top-tier gacha rewards, you're either going to need to be really lucky or prepared to spend a lot of time and/or money. The drop rate for the coveted five-star characters is a mere 0.6%. Fortunately, every 10-wish roll comes with at least one four-star weapon or character, and these are more than sufficient to take on the game's tougher challenges. It's also possible to not spend at all--if you carefully save the Fate and Primogems you acquire in-game, you can still assemble a formidable team. With a 10-wish costing about $20-$30 (depending on how many Genesis Crystals you buy at once), opening your wallet to try for the best stuff can get very pricey very fast.Despite this, Genshin Impact generally manages to dodge a lot of ""pay-to-win"" issues. Even if you get good characters and weapons, you still have to learn to use them well and gather materials to improve their abilities, which can only be achieved through gameplay, and the items you can buy aren't an immediate gateway to becoming overpowered.However, like many free-to-play titles, Genshin Impact is built around getting you to invest time in the game every day. You'll need to explore to find hunting and harvesting spots for materials needed not only for crafting and cooking, but also upgrading your characters and weaponry and increasing your Adventurer's Rank. The Adventurer's Rank in particular can be rather frustrating, particularly early on. Many features like co-op play, certain regions of the map, special dungeons, and even the ability to start crucial story quests are gated behind certain rank numbers, which restricts your play in an otherwise open-world adventure. While plenty of activities in the game yield experience points for the Adventurer's Rank, it can be tedious to spend time doing side quests and exploring areas you're not particularly interested in to open up parts of the game that you do want to see.Another major issue is that, while Genshin Impact is certainly a very nice-looking game, its world doesn't offer much that's all that interesting to see. The landscapes, dungeons, and enemies are generic and samey, with little in the way of interesting areas or architecture to make the world feel distinct from many other anime-inspired fantasy environments. The character design has a similar problem; while the characters certainly aren't unappealing, most of their designs don't really stand out as being particularly striking or memorable.One more important factor that might turn players off is that, because developer MiHoYo is located in mainland China, Genshin Impact is subject to rules imposed by the Chinese government regarding online chat, which means certain politically sensitive terms (like ""Taiwan"" and ""Hong Kong"") are censored in conversation during co-op play. While this is an issue that affects all games from China, some players will understandably not be comfortable playing a game that's subjected to such heavy government censorship.Overall, Genshin Impact is a solid game hampered a bit by the restrictions its free-to-play model imposes. The overall production values are high, and the core gameplay is solid. In particular, the elemental interaction system is a ton of fun and gives the game a distinct personality. But while there's a lot to do, having several chunks of Genshin Impact gated off until you've reached a higher rank is an obnoxious restriction for an open-world game to have--and once you finally do see what lies in those unexplored areas, it's often a bit underwhelming. Still, it's a solid start, and I'll certainly be interested in seeing how Genshin Impact continues to evolve in future updates."
1579,Traverser,6.0,1,"Dishonored in the process and that, even with all that's happened, some folks will find the time to express the desire that their home be painted in garish hues of red, green, and blue. Considering the circumstances, it's a pretty uplifting message, isn't it? That's the world that Traverser presents us, and it has all the ingredients of a scrappy adventure that can grab the hearts of millions in a way that the most blockbusters never could. It's such a shame, then, that this isometric 3D platformer and puzzler becomes such a stark reminder of the fact that good concepts amount to little if they don't have good gameplay to match. It's a concept that works well in part because it's so surreal. At the heart of the world, so to speak, stands a city called Brimstone that floats suspended above a sea of lava and below a cavern roof studded with crystals, and the rich and the poor occupy the top and bottom sides, respectively, through a trick of gravity. Breathable air is the society's main commodity, and the poor denizens of the undercity must trot about in masks to stay alive. Lately, they're not so happy with the arrangement, and a rebellion is at hand when the action kicks off. The story itself centers on young Valerie, who has to find out why her father has disappeared on the same day that she becomes a traverser, a type of secret police in the employ of the company that controls the air supply. She travels between the two cities by pounding on platforms at specific points. She earns tools and information from the populace, and she picks up more lore from scattered recordings in the style of BioShock. Her main tool? A gravity glove that lets her sling around crates and other objects with some precision. It's in this very concept, though, where the first signs of trouble show up. Valerie is told that she has to wear her normal clothes to blend in with the populace, but everyone already seems to know what she is, and many Brimstonians even have the audacity to ask her to perform tasks such as pickpocketing fellow citizens or flinging trash into the void. Whatever else the traversers do, they don't seem to inspire much fear. However, despite the prevailing dark tone of the story, there's plenty of evidence that we're not meant to take all this too seriously and that it may even be aimed at children. The villains, for instance, have a Snidely Whiplash air about them that all but screams that we're supposed to boo and hiss when they amble on screen. Deep in the sewers, there's a diploma on which a mad scientist has scrawled his name as ""Nicholas Cage."" When simply hitting shift to sneak past guards isn't enough, Valerie can hop into a comically oversized barrel and hope her adversaries won't notice. Toss in some jaunty music and an exaggeratedly angular visual design, and it's easy to spot the influence of Tim Burton pervading the whole. This isometric 3D platformer and puzzler becomes such a stark reminder of the fact that good concepts amount to little if they don't have good gameplay to match. All of this would work in Traverser's favor if Valerie's gravity gun were more fun to use. She can use it to smack some enemies out of the way by slamming boxes on them, Magneto-style, but most of the time, she merely uses it to stack boxes to craft makeshift ladders or plop them on buttons or in front of lasers in the style of Portal. That's all fine, but actually using the glove isn't. Grabbing an object and hoisting it up or down requires using both the left mouse button and the mouse's scroll wheel, which can be a bit of a feat when you have to direct the object you're holding with mouse movements as well. Adding to the awkwardness is Traverser's fixed camera, which often prevents you from accurately seeing how high or low an object you're holding is since the camera often ends up perfectly aligned with the beam. The crates and other objects often don't fall into place as easily as they probably should (which, again, might be the fault of the camera), leading to creations that tumble over just when you think you're almost done. The puzzles themselves are usually simple, introductory affairs, although Traverser does manage to generate some excitement when Valerie has to use a number of techniques in quick succession. These moments are especially prevalent in the few boss fights and when Valerie has to switch between the top world and the bottom world to overcome obstacles. Never once, though, does Traverser present a challenge that's truly memorable or satisfying, and other aspects of its gameplay are complicated by the lack of a minimap or the occasional vague entry in Valerie's journal that leaves little clue as to what to do next. Traverser's at its best when it requires Valerie to use stealth, but even that's complicated by unwieldy objectives and guards who can apparently see through walls. Still, there are worse ways to spend four hours, which is the amount of time you'll spend on a full playthrough, and the game's personality is generally strong enough to forgive some of its shortcomings. But it's a shadow of what it could be. Were it better able to traverse the gap between an attractive presentation and engaging gameplay, Traverser would be a game to remember."
1116,DiRT 4,9.0,2,"2015's Dirt Rally was a game designed for off-road enthusiasts. With its steep learning curve, uncompromising difficulty, and an adherence to nerve-wracking authenticity, it was an altogether different beast than the Dirt series' more histrionic entries. Rather than go back to the mainstream, American flavoured well with Dirt 4, Codemasters' latest feels like a natural continuation of Dirt Rally's grounded, white-knuckle philosophies; but with one key difference: there's been a concerted effort this time around to appeal to both veterans and newcomers alike, bridging the gap between the impenetrable and the accessible.This begins at the game's outset, as you're presented with two distinct driving models to choose from: Gamer and Simulation. This isn't just a simple rearranging of assists and difficulty options, but two disparate ways of heaving your chosen vehicle from one corner to another. Gamer makes things considerably softer, minimising your car's stopping distance, and making it much harder to spin out of control--even with imprudent use of the handbrake. The effect of certain weather types and surfaces is also less pronounced, and it's generally a more forgiving ride, with a host of variables--including AI difficulty and myriad assists--allowing you to further tailor its challenge to your liking. Combine this with the deluge of playable tutorials in the Dirt Academy--that teach you everything from how to transfer weight, execute pendulum turns, and handle the differences between front, rear, and four-wheel drive cars--and Dirt 4 is a much more intuitive game to get to grips with than its immediate predecessor.Even in Gamer's relatively muted state, barrelling through each stage and gliding around hairpin turns under the tutelage of your co-driver is immensely enjoyable. Yet, upon stepping down a level from the robust sim, there's this nagging feeling that you're playing with the stabilisers on. Once you're confident enough to move up to Simulation mode, there's a palpable sense that you're unlocking a car's full potential. It's here--similarly to Dirt Rally--where Dirt 4 really shines.In Simulation mode Dirt 4 transforms into a game focused on efficiency and adaptability. You have to be patient and precise, knowing when to push the car to its limits and when to take it steady, tussling with an antagonistic wheel just to keep the car on the track; where one slight miscalculation is likely to end in gut-wrenching disaster. There's a sense of dread that creeps in during moments like this, when you're about to eclipse the top of a hill and have no idea what's waiting for you on the other side. But take the risk and you might receive a reward in return, like the unmistakable elation that arises when you emerge through a stage unscathed. It's this heart-quickening thrill--of knowing you're on the precipice of failure at all times--mixed with the proficiency of its mechanics, that makes Dirt 4 such an engaging rally game to play.There's a plethora of cars available, too, and a singular pleasure to be found in learning each one's intricacies. You'll strap into the majority of these unfettered beasts throughout Dirt 4's globetrotting career mode, which has you driving for sponsors until you have enough money to purchase your own vehicles and design your own racing team. It's a familiar progression loop, gradually increasing in difficulty as you gain access to faster cars and trickier tracks. There's even a touch of team management involved as you hire mechanics to fix your car in between stages, and purchase facility upgrades to, say, hasten that repair time, or expand your garage to fit more vehicles. The bulk of your time, however, will be spent out on the track. Whether that's in rally, Landrush, or Motorcross events is up to you.Landrush encases you inside heaving trucks, buggies, and Crosskarts, and matches you head-to-head against other drivers on sandy courses crammed full of jumps and tight corners. It's a palate cleanser that removes nippy rally vehicles from the equation, but with overlong races, a lack of variety in course design, and only a handful of tracks, it eventually grows dull and repetitive.Dirt 4 maintains the robust depth of Dirt Rally's full-blooded simulation, while smartly opening things up to a wider audience with a heaping of difficulty optionsRallycross fares better, pitting up to eight rally cars against one another on officially licensed FIA World Rallycross tracks. With dust clouds to avoid, risks worth weighing up, and the inevitable collision of chassis on chassis, these energetic races offer a modicum of depth and a change of pace from the demanding rally stages. If you don't fancy either of these racing disciplines, however, the career mode is structured in such a way that you can easily ignore them and focus purely on rally, or mix and match the three together. The choice is yours. There's certainly intermittent fun to be had between the two disciplines (leaning heavily in one direction), but, really, they're both side courses to rally's main dish.This is perhaps most keenly reflected by Your Stage, an ingenious tool that procedurally generates rally stages at the press of a button. All you have to do is adjust two sliders to your liking--one for course length, and another for complexity--and the game will generate a stage using one of its locations as a canvas. From there you can tinker with the time of day and various weather options, and if you like the stage you can share it with friends.With procedurally generated tracks, there was a concern that the seams between each track's assorted parts would be noticeable, but they're surprisingly nuanced and coherently put together. Familiarity has remained absent after hours and hours of play, and it shouldn't really be surprising with a near-infinite amount of potential stages. Yet, despite the impressive tech that conjures these stages from nothing, what ties them all together are the little details. The drones that whizz overhead, barely clipping the roof of your car; and the helicopters that swoop down too low and whip up a perilous dust storm. There's the ecstatic crowd spread out across the stage, and the marshals that wave you down when a vehicle has crashed up ahead. Even a farmhouse at the side of the road, buried amidst the red and brown leaves of a Michigan forest, help bring these stages to life with an authentic believability.Your Stage's most noteworthy achievement, however, is the way it recontextualizes the lifespan of this series going forward. In other rally games, once you've played a stage enough times it veers away from rally territory and becomes little more than a time trial exercise. Suddenly you're not reacting to your co-driver's instructions, but to your own memories. You start figuring out how to save time on familiar corners and hazardous jumps, and that just isn't what rally is about. Your Stage ensures that you're never comfortable. The threat of the unknown remains a persistent threat, and you're forced to rely on nothing but your wits and your co-driver's imperative pacenotes. With--in theory--infinite stages, Dirt 4 maintains its commitment to the unadulterated thrill of rally, and that's a tremendous accomplishment.With daily, weekly, and monthly community challenges also on the agenda, plus competitive online races in each of its three racing disciplines, Dirt 4 is certainly packed full of content. It might not have the same pomp and circumstance of previous numbered entries in the series, but Dirt 4 maintains the robust depth of Dirt Rally's full-blooded simulation, while smartly opening things up to a wider audience with a heaping of difficulty options. If Dirt Rally's punishing difficulty alienated longtime series fans in any way, this commitment to accessibility should help to bring them back, and the near-infinite possibilities of Your Stage should keep them playing. Dirt 4 is a shining example of Codemasters at their brilliant best."
4368,Stranger (2007),4.0,0,"  Stranger certainly lives up to its name. This role-playing/real-time strategy hybrid is decidedly strange in every respect, from its bizarre setting to its unusual game mechanics and its gawky interface. Russian developer Fireglow Games seems to have set out to make something rather offbeat, but then followed this philosophy so far off the beaten path that the end product turned into a surreal, inept jumble of half-baked ideas. Despite a couple of interesting innovations and some traditional hacking-and-slashing that sticks close to a familiar formula, the game is simply too odd and too clumsily made to appeal to either RPG or RTS gamers.        Big problems are posed by the story. Although Stranger resembles a typical action RPG, the tale is incomprehensible, and the backdrop was presumably concocted by someone on a big-time peyote trip. It's hard to understand anything. Tacky comic-book cutscenes dish out crazy stuff about a town populated by wizards and people tossed into an abyss for reasons unknown. A little online research reveals that the story apparently deals with a trio of exiles booted into another dimension for experimenting with forbidden magic, but good luck figuring that out from what you're presented with in the game. For a change, though, this incomprehensibility isn't powered by an unholy mangling of the English language. Fireglow handles the translations from the original Russian quite well, but there simply isn't enough text to explain what's going on. It's as if every comic page in the cutscenes is missing a couple of panels. And the writers really go in for goofy fantasy names that get your head spinning when a bunch of them are crammed into a sentence or two. At one point you're battling Tidderius, master of the Tiddery Citadel, who controls the insidious Lanzrayer, which is vital to defeating the Muneks of Mokkosa. Follow all of that?     Much of the setting is just as disorienting. The landscape mixes alien and surreal, using Day-Glo colors, luminescent lighting, and flora and fauna that seem to have been dropped in from a old Star Trek episode. Much of the soundtrack consists of quirky, synthy tunes that reinforce the mushroom-enhanced vibe of the whole game. Missions in the single-player campaign are really just separate maps with objectives that have nothing to do with each other. Most goals involve a lot of tedious lever pushing, along with battles against boss monsters that require some specific trick to defeat. Monsters themselves are--you guessed it--pretty darn weird. You take on a host of way-out enemies including what appear to be prehistoric butterflies, loads of creepy bugs, orcs who seem to have had their ears flattened out with an iron, and others that defy description. The menagerie here is so off the wall that you almost long for the demons and undead that take up space in every other action RPG.     Although the basic idea is a straightforward mix of a Diablo-style clickfest RPG with RTS staples such as gathering resources and hiring mercenaries (who serve as party members in place of old-fashioned recruited NPCs), the interface is a mess. Instead of the paper-doll interface that RPGs have been leaning on for inventory management for more than a decade, the game uses a lot of dragging and dropping. For instance, to equip a sword, you have to pull up the inventory and then drag the sword either to the appropriate slot on the separate character sheet or to the character himself on the main game screen. All in all, this works, but feels clunky and is hardly intuitive.     Managing the red, green, and blue crystals that serve both for powering magic and for in-game currency when hiring troops is even more of a pain due to a separate drag-drop menu button and the need to fiddle with sliders. The whole crystal system is poorly organized. You use hundreds of the things to cast spells, and have to shift the different colors back and forth between your hero and a storage box, sort of like manipulating the cash in checking and savings accounts. Topping off the confusion is a fourth resource, metal, which can be acquired mainly by melting down gear. This is kind of a neat idea in that you can recycle old armor and shields into swords and axes, or just use the melted-down result as currency. But despite this concept, the process is nearly identical to selling old junk you no longer need in a standard RPG. The only real difference here is the added step of having to melt down the junk before selling it. So the whole process is really just an extra pain that you'll rarely want to bother with.        When not wrangling with the interface, you're playing a typical action RPG. Quests deal with deeply dull ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" stuff where you do favors to open doors, obtain magical artifacts, get a hint about where you're supposed to go next, that sort of thing. And though you're mostly assigned to kill various packs of monsters or bosses to get these rewards, Stranger manages to screw this up with crazy difficulty that forces a lot of grinding. Packs of tough enemies make it impossible to get very far in a level without signing up a big gang of mercenaries to help you out, so you have to spend a half an hour or more killing respawning cannon fodder like giant beetles to earn the crystals needed to go on these hiring sprees. Combat consists of nothing but repetitive right-clicking, too, which numbs the brain awfully fast.     Levels are entirely linear. Maps feature pathways so narrow that you can barely take a step off of the beaten path, let alone leave it entirely, even outdoors. Yet maps can still be perplexing because you often get around courtesy of flying metal grates called terrestres. These contraptions sail sideways across maps as well as up and down from one level to another. This is an okay concept, although the almost MC Escher-like level layout leads to serious confusion at times. Nevertheless, it's a particular problem when ascending or descending to a new area because the camera doesn't automatically follow characters. You soon clue into the fact that you have to manually move the camera to locate your suddenly vanished party of adventurers, but having to do so remains unnecessary and awkward.     Unnecessary and awkward actually sums up Stranger in its entirety. This isn't an entirely awful game, just a mediocre one hampered by some bizarre design decisions, a deeply peculiar setting, and a terrible interface. On second thought, maybe it is awful. At any rate, this is one RPG/RTS hybrid based on hallucinogens that you can safely avoid.    "
1503,Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma Volume One,2.0,0,"The game introduces neophytes to Jinno, an orphan-turned-martial-artist who failed to take his own life in the first Afro Samurai game. He's been rebuilt as the bionic warrior, Kuma, who dons the head of a stuffed bear. Goofy headgear aside, Kuma has potential on a conceptual level: more machine than man, he is insusceptible to the dark temptations that surround him. This potential is never realized.Your interest in Kuma's character is lost the moment Afro Samurai 2 attempts to explore the depths of his past. As you traverse Kuma's old stomping grounds, you're meant to confront the phantoms of those he's lost. It's an emotionally ripe setup, but when your mission objective is so literal--""Confront the reality that everyone you love is dead, and their memories are all you have""--there's nothing to glean from walking in Kuma's shoes. You walk up to characters frozen in time while shrill screams fill the air, one after another. Revenge of Kuma doesn't go to the trouble of working for your sympathy; it naively demands it.The script at large is drowned in impish indulgences, including references to modern-day celebrities--musician Drake and former boxer Mike Tyson come up in conversation--and needless, rampant swearing. I have no problem with such language in principle, but like Moira Burton in Resident Evil: Revelations 2, Afro Samurai 2's script is soured by this forced edginess.Afro Samurai 2 needlessly objectifies women for the sake of nothing but titillation and attitude. The reverb from this particular blare of ignorance is deafening.One scene in particular stands out as egregiously offensive and juvenile. Upon entering a bar filled with women in g-strings (and nothing else), you're confronted by slow zooms and pans on a stripper in the center of the room. An equally-naked DJ calls for your head, but not before the camera shifts to a close-up of her exposed, undulating body. This scene is justified by the plot as a place where men gather, but that premise--because the setting could have been a number of other less salacious locations--is a farce. There's no explicit need to showcase nipples for minutes on end for the story to accomplish its goal. To add insult to injury, upon meeting your mark after your battle with the DJ, he repeatedly refers to her as ""that dead bitch."" Afro Samurai 2 needlessly objectifies women for the sake of nothing but titillation and attitude. The reverb from this particular blare of ignorance is deafening.No, I'm not referring to the soundtrack, which is the only thing resembling ""good"" in the game. Elsewhere, Afro Samurai 2's audio can be literally painful. There are countless moments when one character or sound effect becomes many times louder than anyone or anything else, leading to extreme discomfort. While I may not have picked up on the nuanced lyrics as I engaged in combat, the soundtrack got under my skin, instilling bravado in ways the game otherwise fails to do, fleeting as it is.I wish I could say that its combat mechanics shine through as an exception to Afro Samurai 2's myriad problems, but they're as sloppy and incoherent as the rest of the game. You primarily use one button to create simple combos and another to block incoming attacks. When an enemy comes in for an attack, a button prompt appears over their head. In theory, you would have the full duration of the prompt to deflect an incoming attack, but there's instead a vague window of success within the life of a prompt. You stand a better chance of winning if you simply remain on the offensive, though the wild, needlessly acrobatic animations often take you halfway across the screen.You eventually learn special attacks that are tied to three different fighting styles, but it's a hollow system--with zero added benefit--that unnecessarily complicates things. As you engage with your enemies, you randomly earn skill points. In one fight with a few common enemies, I earned eight, and I had no idea why. The arbitrary dispersal is magnified by the fact that you only need 28 points to unlock everything under Kuma's three skill trees, though you can't unlock the final abilities in each tree because they're locked until the next episode. Just as confusing is the structure of skill trees themselves. Reaching a point on a skill path doesn't mean you can unlock the next buff or ability--the game wants you to jump to another branch of the tree first in some cases, negating the reason for the tree-like structure in the first place.Every moment brings new problems to light, and it doesn't take long before you want to put the controller down and walk away.You probably get by now that Revenge of Kuma isn't worth your time, and I haven't even mentioned the confusing world map, the abrupt transitions between cutscenes and gameplay, the horrible frame rate, the dumbed-down boss fights, and the litany of technical glitches I encountered, including getting stuck in geometry or having to restart the game because it crashed altogether. Every moment brings new problems to light, and it doesn't take long before you want to put the controller down and walk away. Revenge of Kuma makes for a better album than a game, but I wouldn't recommend buying it for that reason either, since you're required to suffer the game to listen to music that's trapped within.In the words of Revenge of Kuma: Confront the reality that everything you loved about the first Afro Samurai game is dead, and your memories are all you have."
3847,Altered Beast,5.0,1," As the retro bandwagon picks up steam, we're starting to see more and more old games hitting a variety of different platforms. The Tapwave Zodiac, theoretically, is powerful enough to run a lot of emulated 8- and 16-bit games at full speed. That's the theory behind Altered Beast for the Zodiac, which is an emulated Sega Genesis game. However, flaws in the emulation and lack of two-player support make this one a real drag.      Altered Beast is a game based on a solid premise. Nef, one of the minor demons of Hades, has kidnapped Athena and is using her as a bargaining chip for control of Mount Olympus. Zeus, powerless to stop this menace, summons you--an undead warrior--to his cause. The fact that Athena is one of ancient Greece's two gods of war was apparently a fact unknown to Sega in 1998, as the demure lass is helpless to escape Nef's foul clutches. Zeus has chosen you because of your unique ability to polymorph into several different fighting beasts by harnessing the power of ""spirit orbs,"" floating power-ups dropped by the taupe-blue bulls that proliferate in each of the game's levels. While that may sound like a bit much, the game is really just a pretty standard side-scrolling beat-'em-up.   The Zodiac port of the game is simply an emulated version of the Genesis Altered Beast. As such, it is technically identical Sega's 16-bit port of the game. However, the game runs a lot slower than the original game. The game also lacks the two-player simultaneous play of the Genesis game, a fact that sorely robs the game of most of its value. As if to taunt you about this fact, the game's rolling attract mode demo even shows the game being played by two-players--all fun you can never have. This should be regarded as cruel and unfair.    Each of the game's stages follows a similar format: You must battle your way through hordes of undead minions until you have collected three spirit orbs. The first orb you collect transforms you into a muscleman, the second, into a superman, and the third and final orb transmogrifies you into one of several horrific creatures, depending on the level. As these creatures, you'll gain new powers, like dash attacks, electrical fields, and the ability to throw fireballs at your foes. Once you've attained monster form, you get to square off against one of Nef's forms. In one level, he becomes a terrifying, eyeball-spewing plant.   It should be noted that Altered Beast is an unforgiving, difficult game. You have three lives--no continues--and your health does not recharge in between levels. The Zodiac version is made even more challenging by the fact that you have only a mediocre analog stick to work with in lieu of a more 2D-appropriate directional pad.   Graphically, Altered Beast looks like the Genesis game. The characters are large and reasonably detailed. However, the game doesn't run at full speed, especially if you run the game in the emulator's full screen mode. In windowed mode, the overall game speed is still noticeably slower than it should be. As for Altered Beast's sound, it is identical to that of the Genesis game, which featured equally itchy highs, particularly in the second level, in which your dragon creature uses a shock technique to damage enemies. As the Zodiac already tends to sound a bit tinny in the high end, you may find yourself disabling the game's sound to save your ears.   The original arcade version of Altered Beast was a terrific game, and this emulated version is a pale, weak version of the game it tries so hard to be. The game's slow speed and the lack of a two-player mode are inexcusable flaws. The Zodiac's Bluetooth feature would have made cooperative play simple to include. But as if to rub it in, the game actually asks you, before starting up the game, to be sure you have disabled Bluetooth. In its incomplete, single-player state, Altered Beast is inferior to its predecessor and not worth buying if you're a Zodiac owner. "
510,The Last of Us Part II,8.0,2," Editor's note: Due to embargo restrictions around spoilers, parts of this review are intentionally vague. We've done our best to explain certain parts of the game and our critique without discussing any story spoilers; however, if you want to understand the full context of our analysis here, you can read the spoilery version of this review, which discusses the story in greater detail and further explains our thoughts. That review has the same score and just serves as a deeper, more detailed analysis for those who want to read more.The Last of Us Part II, you get a glimpse of Ellie's life in idyllic Jackson, Wyoming. If it weren't for the walls surrounding the town, you could almost forget that the world is crawling with infectious monsters that would kill everyone in sight; its main road, blanketed in snow, is a charming row of old buildings with decks for sidewalks, more Old West town than post-apocalypse settlement. Its residents grow food, care for horses, tend bars, and even have dances and movie nights. Four years after Joel saved (kidnapped?) Ellie from the Firefly hospital, this is the life he wanted for her.The Last of Us Part II grapples with Joel's decision not through Joel, but through Ellie. This life is clearly not enough for her; she's distant and brooding, obviously conflicted about something. She's changed a lot. And when everything falls apart and she sets out in search of vengeance, you see her pain in its rawest, most brutal form. It's a devastating, gruesome story of revenge in which the purpose of violence gets muddied by its intensity. But as a character study, The Last of Us Part II is beautiful and haunting, and I found myself completely overwhelmed by the emotional weight of it.In some ways, I mean that literally. The game gave me stress nightmares, not because you kill a lot of people per se, but because playing as Ellie felt more like being dragged by my hair than being immersed in her mission. From the very beginning, I wanted to reach out and shake Ellie, as her proxy in all this, and get her to do anything other than what we were about to do. I knew her revenge quest was bad news before the killing and maiming really began.There are narrative reasons for that, though, and they do work. Being helpless as a player in the face of Ellie's destruction serves a grander purpose that I won't spoil here. The biggest issue is that the most impactful of her kills occur in cutscenes rather than in combat, and that obscures the purpose of combat's more upsetting aspects.The Last of Us Part II's combat is tense and exhilarating, though confronting in its brutality. Ellie is scrappy and agile, and moving through a combat arena is an art. Her movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance. You can accidentally alert an enemy to your presence only to slip through a tight space in the wall, vault through a window, and outrun your pursuer through a building to reestablish your cover and gain the upper hand. You can also easily get surrounded and die horribly, whether you're fighting people or infected.Navigating any given combat scenario is a puzzle in which you have to figure out exactly how to get from point A to point B with the resources you have. I'm partial to stealth when possible, and it's especially rewarding to decide how you're going to silently kill each enemy with only a flimsy silencer, two arrows, and your default knife. Should you kill the blind clickers first because they're strong and deadly, or should you kill the infected runners first because they can see you? Can you retrieve an arrow from a corpse to be reused on their friend? Most importantly, where's the exit?You can also find yourself going up against both humans and infected at the same time, and this is when combat is properly fun instead of just tense. By throwing a bottle, you can draw a clicker toward an enemy soldier and simply wait for them to kill each other. You can shoot glass above an enemy's head to send a runner or two straight to their location. You can simply take advantage of the chaos and start shooting indiscriminately. Regardless, it makes you feel clever and giddy and weirdly proud of yourself.Of course, that's if you numb yourself to the guttural screams of the man whose arm you just shot off or the awful gurgling sound of someone drowning in their own blood. Enemies use each other's names and aren't shy about crying out when they find their friend David or Rachel or whoever lying face-down in a pool of blood, suddenly dead from your silent knife takedown. Killing someone's dog is a priority, as they can track your scent and maul you to death, but you have to hear them mourn the dog in real-time. It helps--or maybe doesn't help--that the game runs flawlessly, even on a standard PS4, so there are no hiccups to dampen the viciousness.Ellie's movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance.All of that surely exists to make you feel bad about killing people and their dogs. But like I said above, the kills that actually matter in the broader scope of the story happen in cutscenes. Some are triggered by a button prompt or preceded by a brawl, but it's all very controlled; it's not like you're killing these important people in a regular combat scenario, realizing with horror later what you've done. These are the kills that end up hurting the most, and they're going to happen no matter what you do or what you think of all the violence. That's why they work so well for the story, but that also leaves the rest of the bloodshed rather unexamined.Frankly, the fact that your enemies have names doesn't make them any less in your way. You have to do what you have to do to get to the next location, and you want to do that to see where the story goes next.This disconnect between the video game-y aspects and the grander narrative is compounded by looting and collectible-hunting. Looting during a fight is exciting, especially when you find the one extra bullet you need or a bit of health that can keep you going. But more often than not, I'd loot and look for collectibles only after I'd killed every enemy in the vicinity. It's far easier and safer, for one, and I didn't want to miss any of the interesting sub-plots found in scattered notes and photographs just because I wanted to kill fewer people.Finding collectibles and piecing together the stories held within them is rewarding and paints a picture of the outbreak as it developed through the years. A bank robbery gone wrong sticks out as a favorite, and there are quite a few other stories worth finding. A lot of the time, seeking out these collectibles will force you to get creative--things like breaking windows to bypass a locked door or swinging on a cable to get to an area that's just out of reach. There's nothing so difficult that you feel like a genius for figuring it out, but it does make you feel appropriately resourceful.Most of the time, there aren't any collectibles to find in combat-heavy areas. But there are still notes and things to find when enemies are around, and as a result, I ended up scouring every corner of every area in the hopes of finding something cool. Because most combat arenas give you multiple avenues of attack and escape, though, I ended up backtracking through most of them to try to find things, and that can severely disrupt the pacing. The nooks and crannies that work well in combat just become one more place to look for a note or trading card, and the fact that you're looking for trading cards at all often feels too game-y for the otherwise sobering tone.I ended up enabling an accessibility option called high-contrast mode to help with my collectible hunt. When toggled on, it mutes the background, removes textures, and highlights interactable objects and enemies. I used it after clearing an area of enemies to speed up the looting part, and while it wasn't the most elegant solution, it did help the pacing. It's one of a litany of accessibility options, too, which allow you to fine-tune the gameplay, sound, and visuals to your needs. It's a commendable suite that's incredibly inclusive.In the second half of the game, these exploration issues persist, as do the horrors of combat and violence. But for reasons I can't explain due to spoiler restrictions, the narrative shifts significantly at a certain point, and the context of everything you've done up until then changes along with it. There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but this half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all. It examines a lot of the violence that happens early on, though not all the violence in general, and it's where the story finds its meaning.There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but the second half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all.By the time I finished The Last of Us Part II, I wasn't sure if I liked it. It's a hard game to stomach, in part because so much of who Ellie is and what she does is beyond your control. She is deeply complicated and flawed, and her selfishness hurts a lot of people. At times, the pain you inflict feels so senseless that it can leave you numb. It's all messy and bleak and made me profoundly sad for myriad reasons, but the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core. I wanted almost none of it to happen the way it did, and that's what's both beautiful and devastating about it."
3432,Metroid: Other M,8.0,2,"             Metroid Prime, but a creepy underground lair teeming with insects and overgrown foliage creates a forbidding feeling, and the heat-intense lava world is striking. Unfortunately, the weak technical aspects are no match for the artistic vision. Low-resolution texture maps permeate this game, which gives everything a hazy look. Because of this, Other M is not as impressive to look at as it could have been. The music also is similar thematically to previous games in the franchise, but the accompanying score sounds more like outtakes from older entries than a moody new soundtrack. The strangest part of the audio is the absence of the famous Metroid tune when you nab a new item. That jingle is so ingrained in the franchise that it's strange to collect an upgrade and not hear it.       It should take around 12 hours to play through Other M, which is a fine length for an action-focused game. But because the combat is so thrilling, and it's so rewarding to search for every item along the way, the ending pops up all too soon. You'll likely be left wanting more of this exciting adventure, a testament to the invigorating quality of the smoothly executed shift in focus. People expecting Other M to conform to the elements that made Super Metroid and Metroid Prime classics may be disappointed at first, but stick with it. This is another great entry in the series, and a refreshing change of pace for the well-traveled bounty hunter.   "
4092,Soldier of Fortune: Payback,4.0,0,"  If you've ever wondered what happened to the Soldier of Fortune franchise, you're not alone. The first two Soldier of Fortune games were popular shooters in their day, blending fun single-player and multiplayer gameplay with the concept of playing as a mercenary. But after 2002's Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix, the franchise seemed to fall off the face of the planet. Unfortunately, it should have stayed missing in action because the series has been resurrected with Soldier of Fortune: Payback, a shooter that embraces all the wrong lessons that have been learned over the past decade.        At first glance, Payback looks like a very pretty game. The visuals aren't cutting-edge, but there's an attractive quality to them, from the lavish depth-of-field blur effects that kick in whenever you reload your weapon to the lush lighting. You no longer play as John Mullins, the hero of the first two games, but rather as a new mercenary caught up in a very cliché and badly told tale of a worldwide terrorist organization that's so clever it brands all of its operatives with the very same tattoo on their necks. It's a wonder they're so difficult to find.     However, it all goes downhill quickly because Payback reveals itself to be a relentlessly linear and highly scripted shooter with a lot of flaws. Perhaps the most frustrating of these deals with the fact that the game relies on a checkpoint save system with no ability to quicksave, which means that if you're killed, you have to restart from the last checkpoint. That wouldn't be so much of an issue if those checkpoints were frequent and numerous, but they're not. Thus, much of the game's six to eight hours of gameplay is spent trying and retrying to get through the many sections of the game. Though there's a regenerating health system, you still die all too easily. It's not uncommon to have to replay a section a dozen times or more before you finally beat it.      The artificial intelligence is bad and consists mainly of two scripted actions. Once triggered, a bad guy will either run straight at you or stand in the open and shoot at you. There's no sense of dynamic behavior in the way the AI reacts to what you do. The weapon modeling is nonexistent; there's practically zero recoil on any of the weapons, even the light machine guns. On the flip side, even though the weapons all feel incredibly lightweight, they do a ridiculous amount of damage. The first Soldier of Fortune games were ""edgy"" in that you could practically dismember opponents with gunfire. The same goes for Payback, though it looks like the developers just copied and pasted the same code from the earlier games because the visual effect is almost exactly the same. Arms, legs, and heads all get shot off with absurd regularity while blood gushes everywhere. (The game does boast a low violence option that tones down this carnage.)        The music is actually pretty catchy, but the rest of the audio is lacking. The sound effects all seem canned, and the voice acting is terrible. The script certainly doesn't help either because the dialogue would be fitting for a straight-to-VHS action movie. The game also ends in a silly cliffhanger that assumes that gamers are going to want more of this action.     Additionally, Payback's multiplayer is very generic, with such modes as deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag. There's a whopping five multiplayer maps total, so there's not a lot of variety there either, which is also disappointing, considering Soldier of Fortune II's popular and fun multiplayer mode.     The PC game is slightly less expensive than major titles, but the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games are full priced. Nevertheless, they're all a terrible value proposition considering the sheer quantity and high quality of shooters this year. Unless you like pain and frustration, there's simply no reason to play Soldier of Fortune: Payback when there are so many other better games on the market.   "
927,The Swords of Ditto,7.0,2,"The main loop of each playthrough is simple: Wake up, gather a sword from its resting place in the town of Ditto--either from statue or in the graveyard--to become the hero, then seek out the Toys of Legend to destroy the Anchors that the villain Mormo uses to strengthen her grasp on the world, making her easier to defeat in the final confrontation. If you die before then, Mormo wins and Ditto lives under her rule for another 100 years before the new Sword of Ditto is awakened, and the cycle continues. If you succeed, Ditto lives in peace for 100 years until Mormo returns, and it all happens all over again. Getting the hang of this can all feel a little overwhelming at first, but any confusion quickly slips away as the game’s rhythm settles in, and it doesn’t take long to feel comfortable with what’s expected of you.Co-op play is local only, but the drop-in, drop-out system makes it very easy to have another player come and go at any moment. It also changes up the dynamics of play fairly significantly. Enemies are stronger, as you’d expect, meaning some enemies require a more tactical approach to take down. Items are shared between players, which can put a sudden strain on health items if you’re both struggling to deal with the added difficulty. Thankfully this is alleviated somewhat by an increased item drop rate, so health items can be replenished nearly as quickly as you go through them.The entirety of the explorable areas are made up of individual sections that are pieced together at random for each playthrough. When out exploring the world, there’s plenty to find and keep you busy. In Zelda-like fashion, you can slice up grass to score more coins or health items. One standout touch: If the weather is dry, you can torch a field of grass and watch it all go up in super-satisfying fashion. Random shops, caves and houses filled with cute and interesting characters dot the world, and while some only share a few repeated lines of dialogue, others offer quests for items or keys to unlock dungeons in other parts of the map. Almost everywhere you look there’s something else to see and do, and it’s this sense of discovery that's felt when finding these hidden gems that makes The Swords of Ditto so rewarding.Combat is mechanically straightforward; you can perform a simple melee attack with your sword as well as a roll dodge, and you have four interchangeable gear slots for items or weapons that are accessed using the d-pad. You can also buff your character by applying stickers that you find around the world or purchase within certain shops. It’s all fairly rudimentary, but despite the combat’s relative simplicity the enemies are a huge challenge, and this is where it gets gratifying.Each foe has its own unique way of attacking or defending, and learning this for each enemy will make you much more effective at taking them down. The three-headed fireball will, if it touches you, turn your sword attacks into healing slashes for a few seconds, forcing you to retreat before the effect wears off. The green slime-ball monster falls harmlessly apart when physically attacked--it'll only taking damage when it’s set on fire. It takes some time to learn all of this, but when you do, combat feels much more satisfying. You become more capable of clearing large groups of monsters than if you’d just kept slashing away, and having to think each encounter through makes it all the more enjoyable.Dungeon puzzles are also relatively simple yet engaging. Some involve coloured switches that rearrange the room entirely, altering your path and the enemies within. Some rooms simply involve killing all the enemies to make a key or a chest appear, while others are increasingly more elaborate and labyrinthian. It’s not unusual to come across a room that demands you place a multiple runes in slots that only appear when a certain switch is triggered, all separated by large chasms, locked doors, and rows of floor spikes. Later rooms will combine all of these variables into one, adding a light complexity that manages to keep things breezy and enjoyable.Alongside the puzzles, each dungeon submits to the Isle of Trials rules--a set of modifiers that changes the rules of how each dungeon works. Early dungeons will only have one or two of these applied, but later playthroughs will throw upwards of four, and they could be anything from negating poison to activating auto-health-regen while prohibiting the use of consumables. These modifiers keep the game and the dungeons feeling fresh, especially in subsequent attempts, offering new challenges that unpredictably swing things either for or against you.It’s not a game without issue, though. Even while playing on PS4 Pro, The Swords of Ditto can be prone to quite a bit of slow down and stutter, mostly when there are lots of items strewn about. I also had a couple of triggering issues that would block my progress, meaning I had to quit to the menu and reload the game to reset the room. But the biggest problem is the time limit that’s enforced for each playthrough. You are only given a handful of in-game days--which changes depending on difficulty--to explore, gather resources, and complete quests before being forced into confrontation with Mormo at the end of the final day. Not only that, it feels like the days are too short, making some of the more elaborate discoveries difficult to fully engage with in a single playthrough.While you can unlock the ability to rewind time by collecting enough of a particular type of item and taking them to a shrine, you have to collect yet a second currency to purchase them on top of that. Given that some of the items required for these longer quests are lost with a new character, It feels like you should have this ability to purchase rewinds from the start. This would have given me more confidence to explore more of the game, instead of keeping one eye on the days remaining and the other on whatever tasks are left to complete.The Swords of Ditto is nothing short of a light-hearted good time. Despite a few bumps getting in the way of progress and some misgivings about the forced time limit per playthrough, it’s still a joy to slash through enemies and collect items while humming the game’s ear-tickling soundtrack. Meeting oddball characters and watching the world react to past playthroughs is a wonderful exercise, and pushing through the game’s barriers to exploration feels rewarding every time. While it needs a little refinement, The Swords of Ditto is sure to delight, whether played on your own or with a friend."
3485,Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow,7.0,2,"        The earliest stretches of the game establish a good story setup, but that momentum quickly fizzles out due to the sheer number of possible peripheral pursuits thrown at you. Awakened Shadow is brimming with optional side quests--so many, in fact, that the main story quests tend to get lost among them. Completing initial quests unlocks main characters for you to recruit into your party, but many others have you wandering around killing random monsters, fetching items, and helping out your pals in often trivial ways. Many of these tasks feel like needless distractions from the main plot. For example, is it really that important to get wrapped up in playing cupid for the other romantically inept heroes? At times, it feels like there's no rush to save the day. That detracts a bit from the game and leaves the overall experience feeling a little unfocused. Once the adventure opens up and lets you venture to other cubes, there's a lot more to see and do, but it's also not always clear what specific objectives you must meet or items you need to obtain to proceed.      "
1172,Styx: Shards of Darkness,6.0,1,"Shards of Darkness marks the return of the titular protagonist Styx, a foul-mouthed Goblin who originated in the 2012 RPG Of Orcs and Men. The 2014 prequel Styx: Master of Shadows was the spin off that made the shift to third-person stealth-action. Neither is required to engage in this new low-fantasy adventure, though some things remain constant. The substance known as Amber governs the world as an energy source. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs are caught up in a power struggle while Goblins, like Styx, are treated as vermin.A new material, called Quartz, shakes up the established political landscape and you embark on a journey to unravel its implications. However, twists and turns throughout the story lack any sort of gravitas. The supporting cast of characters like Helledryn and Djarak are integral to the events that unfold, but their motivations aren’t quite clear or put into a larger context. The same can be said about Styx, who seems to be suspect of those around him but is willing to go along with whatever plan his newfound partners put together without much thought. His convictions are flimsy and hardly go in any direction.Styx himself is written to be comically vulgar, but attempts at humor fall flat. The heavy-handed self-referential and fourth wall-breaking quips throughout the game aren’t clever and often don’t fit the tone of the world. Important story events that occur mid-mission--that should induce panic in those within the vicinity--don’t translate to much of any consequence in-game. The premise is primitive, and the story only serves as a vehicle for the thrill of avoiding detection or executing assassinations.The majority of your main quest is subject to making it to a certain point in the level or snatching a specific item. Hardly are there ever twists or curve balls in the mission parameters to keep things interesting, aside from a mid-game break in the traditional mission design. While side objectives emerge as you traverse levels, they often result in simply going to another room you wouldn’t otherwise or killing a certain NPC. A few puzzles are sprinkled here and there to break up the pace, but feel more like a diversion than a compliment. The sense of trepidation from other stealth games or situations that require you to think on your feet are few and far between.Shards of Darkness would be nothing without its fluid controls. Running, crouching, and jumping are responsive and complement the opportunities to interact with your environment. A cover mechanic makes Styx adhere to the nearest wall and often recognizes your intended cover. That same button also lets Styx grab onto the ledge if you walk off the edge of a surface, which helps avoid dangerous falls and makes engaging in wall scaling a breeze. Leaping for ledges to reach new heights or shimmy across to bypass a locked door provides a smooth flow for combing through the levels. Scaling cliffs at the port in Korrangar highlights a sense of verticality and the ability to engage these heights.A five-pronged skill tree is in place to help build the type of character you want Styx to be; learn to craft new items through the alchemy tree or earn the talent to assassinate enemies from above in the kill tree. Amber--akin to mana--fuels Styx’s powers. Spawn a clone to act as a controllable dummy and lure enemies or cloak to simply pass by unnoticed. Amber vision highlights key objects within the surrounding area, and doesn’t cost anything to activate, though it will fade out as you move. These abilities form a neat toy box to pull from throughout the game.Styx also has a few tools at his disposal, such as acid traps and deadly bolts for a lethal approach, and balls of sand to extinguish fires and glass bottles for distractions. One of the more useful items is the odorous vial, which masks your musty goblin scent from the sharp noses of dwarves who will detect you if you’re in their proximity. These items can be picked up along the way, but you’ll more commonly acquire them by crafting from raw materials. The crafting system is simple and functional, and gives a slight incentive to examine your surroundings.So many tools and abilities are at your disposal and should make for enticing permutations in your encounters, but the scope in which you’re asked to exercise these capabilities is underwhelming.Enemy AI is a throwback to the early days of stealth games, and that’s not a compliment. They’ll go through the traditional behavior states, like searching, alert, and hostile phases. Guards searching for you will relegate their sighting to cliches like, “it was just a shadow,” or, “my mind was playing tricks,” as they return to a normal state. Enemies will occasionally keep you on your toes during alert phases as they’ll look in closets, under tables, and over ledges where you could hide. But if they lose track of you in a hostile phase or discover dead bodies--even of important figures--NPCs will eventually return to their patrol as if nothing had happened. Along with predictable patrol patterns, enemies are frequently in simplistic arrangements. They often act as separate entities and lack dynamic behavior. You’re often left unchallenged and can resort to unsophisticated solutions to complete mission objectives.Combat isn’t a focus of the game, and it shows. The system in place is reduced to a clunky one-button parry that allows you to pounce the enemy after a successful block. If multiple guards are in close proximity, the game will struggle to recognize which one you’re parrying and often negates your ability to make a kill in combat. Certain skills can make this easier, but you’re better off avoiding it all together. Even if it’s intended to be used sparingly in tight situations, its implementation is off the mark.Despite these shortcomings, smooth traversal mechanics and useful abilities are supplemented by the sprawling environments and dense levels throughout the game. The scale of Hunter’s Village astonishes as you step out of a deep, dark dungeon and overlook this seaside city. It’s riddled with houses full of loot, guards that detect you in different ways, and objectives that take you through every nook and cranny. Hopping from house to house unnoticed, keeping your distance from nosey dwarves, while investigating the location of quest items is Shards of Darkness at its best.Even the shadowy underground fortresses have a grand scale and inspire awe. But the underlying disappointment is that you’re rarely given much of a reason to explore. That is unless you embark on the search for tokens, arbitrarily scattered throughout each mission. And despite the well-crafted environments, the game recycles these locations at the halfway point of Styx’s latest journey.If you’re in for a challenge, higher difficulties will make detection parameters more strict and disable the combat system entirely. Guards are quicker to reach a heightened alert state and will kill you in one melee attack. Styx can’t take much damage on normal difficulty, but to escape pursuing guards will require much more effort. Carelessness will get you killed so expect more of a trial-and-error experience. You also have the option to disable objective markers, separate from difficulty, and to encourage more exploration.Co-operative play is a new addition to the series, and it allows you to play the story missions with a friend or a random player through matchmaking. You have the option to enable co-op at any point in a mission as a host in “Create a Clone” and a player searching for a game will connect. “Become a Clone” puts you in a search for a random game to join. This can be a fun feature but it’s more of a hinderance than an advantage, not because of unpredictable player skill, but because there are now two players that can get caught. It’s also impossible to communicate if you're not using a third-party chat service. Co-op alongside a friend is much more viable and makes for brilliantly fun instances, but note that disabled saving forces you to finish missions in one fell swoop.The better moments of Styx: Shards of Darkness are confined to a path that has already been tread in the stealth-action genre, but that doesn't mean they aren't valuable here. The thrill of pulling off a flawless assassination as you smoothly sneak off with valuable artifacts is what makes these types of games worth playing. But its detractors--cliche writing, unsophisticated AI, and arbitrary quests--culminate to an experience that feels like it's stuck in the past."
4412,Alundra 2,4.0,0,"Few games reek of the grasping, guileless profiteering that goes on in the game industry as much as Alundra 2 does - it's a sad, uninspired attempt to turn a mildly popular game into a mildly popular franchise. Lifeless exercises like this game are cooked up when companies are concerned merely with name recognition and branding, and quality comes in a distant second to marketing. While it's definitely playable, it's mediocre in almost every way and begs the question - why would you even consider it, with the plethora of titles on the platform? In this new adventure you'll be playing as Flint, the typical disproportionate, red-haired, cute-faced anime hero of whimsical RPGs. Pirates have killed his parents, you see, and there's a price on his head. You'll meet up with a dashing princess, the weasely pirates, and the oddly green and malevolent Mephisto, a sorcerer bent on world domination via the bizarre method of inserting clockwork keys into people and animals, turning them into android killing machines and slaves. Alundra 2 dispenses with any and all ties to the original game. This time around, Contrail - creator of the Wild Arms series and Legend of Legaia - has the chief creative duties on this game. Of course, the term ""creative"" is used very loosely here - because Alundra 2 isn't particularly original. Basically, we have a by-the-book experience, the endless banality unsuccessfully obscured by inane minigames. Gone too is the title character, Alundra, and any graphical, artistic, or thematic references to the original game.  The gameplay, too, is absolutely nothing original or inventive. The game employs endless standard action-RPG methodology - you have a sword, and you must smack things with it. Of course, magic is on the horizon as well. The control implementation is not the best either, and Flint will overshoot his targets in a desperate leap and get smacked upside the head in the worst scenario. Of course, getting smacked upside the head is more common than ever in Alundra 2, because Activision's almost flawless localization is marred by the increased ""normal"" difficulty level. The enemies do otherworldly damage in this mode. Thankfully, they have left ""easy"" - the original difficulty level in the Japanese version. Alundra 2 dispenses with its prequel's 2D graphics, which while basic, were functional. Instead we've got hapless pointy, jagged, and seamy polygons flickering and clipping their way through a universe of warped and pixelated textures. This game would've been graphically mediocre in 1997 - but for the occasional decent texture map. Soundwise, Alundra 2 is much more reasonable - while the music is fairly derivative of the work of such mainstay fantasy composers as Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu, it's handled with complete competence and serves as a desperate, valiant background to the floundering mechanics and jagged graphics.  The character voices are lively, and the text is grammatical, occasionally amusing, and pretty natural - Activision's localization team has done a great job. It's a shame that this effort was wasted on such a mediocre title. Hopefully, the company's marketing department will see beyond branding next time and acquire a more interesting game. Alundra 2 suffers most from the fact that there is no real reason for it to exist. Fans of the original adventure will surely be disappointed with this one: Being suckered into buying a game that's a purported sequel and then receiving a product that bears no resemblance to the original is a frustrating experience. This game sold extremely poorly in Japan, so the prospects of a true Alundra sequel are dim at best, unless it's a smashing success in the USA. While it's true that almost all games are created as profit machines, some transcend - Alundra 2 is an unkind reminder that pulls us back into the base clay."
977,OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes,6.0,1,"You play as a young boy named K.O. who aspires to be the world's greatest hero. He is aided in his journey by his delightful group of friends (such as the cool-as-ice Enid, the slacker Radicles, and the tough-as-nails Mr. Gar) who all hang out and work with him at the Lakewood Strip Mall. But when the evil Lord Boxman from across the street threatens to take down Lakewood by resetting every hero's POW card (which depicts their ""hero levels"") to zero, it's up to K.O. to help restore everyone's levels by beating up an endless factory line of robots. Let's Play Heroes is primarily a beat-'em-up with some simple RPG elements, such as a basic leveling system and side-quests, sprinkled in. While this helps keep the game from getting too mundane, it only partially succeeds in alleviating the tedium.The game's beat-'em-up combat is simple but has enough variety to keep things engaging. Attacks and dodges are performed with single button presses, and advanced moves involve a few more directional changes but nothing too tricky to master. Like most beat-'em-up games, there are also a large number of super techniques, called Powie Zowies, available to unlock. As you complete each stage, you earn experience points that go towards leveling up your Strength, Agility, or Cool stats. With three attributes, there might have been potential to shape K.O. to your desired playstyle, but disappointingly, the stats only serve as a way to keep advanced moves locked until you reach certain levels.Each enemy robot has its own unique skillset, and some battle stages have item crates containing useful weapons. These factors encourage some strategic thinking, but the limited number of enemy types and the simplistic AI means that you can win almost every battle in the same manner with the same attacks. These robot fights only become remotely challenging during boss battles, but these are few and far between.When you are not battling robots, the rest of Let's Play Heroes involves exploring Lakewood Strip Mall and talking to the various side characters to unlock their Powie Zowies via simple side-quests. Unfortunately, most of your options are either long-winded fetch quests or battles against robots, quickly turning these tasks into a grind. The game falls into a tedious pattern of talk, fetch item and/or fight, and talk again. There are a few mini-games available, but they are generally nothing more than reskinned or tweaked versions of the game's many robot battles.The repetitiveness also does nothing to help the game's poor pacing. Despite the high-stakes story (for the OK K.O.! universe), Let's Play Heroes plays out like a series of meandering vignettes that mostly ignore the overarching storyline, not unlike the narrative structure of the show. While that approach may work in TV, the result is a game with too much padding and little in the way of forward momentum.What Let's Play Heroes lacks in narrative urgency and mechanical depth, it almost makes up for in its presentation. Rather than imitate the show's simple presentation, like what The Fractured But Whole did with South Park, OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes features its own colorful interpretation of the characters and universe. In contrast to the show's static look, the game's art style is dynamic and rich in detail yet simple enough to capture the tone of the source material.Complementing the eye-pleasing visuals is the excellent audio design, notably the soundtrack and voice acting. Each background track feels entirely in tune with the show’s whimsical tone, right down to K.O.’s adorable beatboxing. The voice cast from the show lends their talent to the game, giving Let’s Play Heroes a wonderful sense of familiarity and comfort. Writing and characterization are also top notch, and perfectly capture the quirky nature of the show. Witty one-liners, layered jokes, and meta gags are generously sprinkled throughout the game, though these sadly start to run out towards the final act. All the characters in Let's Play Heroes are well-realized, with nearly every hero and villain given enough time to shine in their interactions with K.O., all while staying faithful to their TV counterparts. It goes a long way in not only pleasing long-time fans, but also establishing character relationships and dynamics for those unfamiliar.There is also an additional payoff for those who watch the show religiously, though it's something may frustrate newcomers: The game features a special vending machine that allows you to input secret hidden codes found within episodes of the show in exchange for POW cards that are otherwise unobtainable. While this kind of locked content is disconcerting, Let’s Play Heroes’ simplistic fighting system renders this almost unnecessary. The fact that you can easily finish the game without unlocking these hidden POW cards means the mechanic ultimately doesn’t have a significant effect on the overall experience, though it may frustrate those who want to collect every POW card in the game.As far as adaptations go, OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes looks and sounds fantastic in a way that is distinct yet faithful to the source material. But the shallow mechanics, the repetitiveness of the gameplay loop, and narrative pacing issues prevent the game from being a rousing knockout."
319,The Ascent,6.0,1,"If you've ever worked a job where your bosses are the worst people imaginable, and they ask you to fix a problem using broken tools and then blame you for the results like it's your fault, then you have a pretty good idea of what it's like to play The Ascent. That's not just a metaphor, either. It's literally the baked-in plot of the game. It's the far-off future, and in order to escape to Veles (an intergalactic project block for all the galaxy's huddled masses yearning to breathe free), you must sign away your freedom to become an indentured servant, or Indent, to one of the various corporate masters running the place. In the first area of gameplay, you're literally forced to clean Veles' toilets by fixing the sewage system. By the time the credits roll, even after hours of mowing down scumbags, watching your character become a metal monster, and running odd jobs for weirdos and strangers, it’s hard to feel like you’ve worked your way up from those starting sewers.The small blessing is that the job involves fewer plungers, and more heavy sci-fi weaponry and cybernetic enhancements. The Ascent is a twin-stick shooter, with a slew of RPG elements thrown in for flavor. You'll find an impressive and unique assortment of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and rocket launchers along the way, each of which can attack enemy weaknesses for extra damage, and they all have very different practical feels in-game. Armor has a similarly expansive variety, with the added benefit of changing your character's look to an increasingly mechanical degree. It's not great that most of those armor pieces obscure your custom-made character--what's the point of creating a character whose face you immediately cover up?--but the designs are incredibly cool.You'll also gain special abilities along the way, ranging from a hydraulic-powered melee attack that can vaporize your enemies to deadly drone companions who can fight by your side. My personal favorite is an army of explosive spider bots who run out and autonomously seek enemies to blow up. For the most part, though, you'll be spending most of your time running and gunning through what are essentially expansive, RPG-style, isometric dungeons, where both a well-thought out combination of armor and cyborg magic is just as important as having the right gun for the job. When your mission is done, you can head back to one of the game's bustling shopping districts to spend skill points on various character stats, as well as buy upgrades, new items, and new cybernetic toys to splice into yourself.The Ascent can occasionally be a game of simple, splattery joy in which you waste an endless parade of mutants and cyborgs for hours on end. The Ascent hits its stride when you're actually well-equipped and your armor protects you against just enough to make overwhelming odds a source of caution instead of panic. But those stretches are hard to come by. The second you create your character and step off the first platform to get yelled at about feces coming out of your boss's shower, it's already anything but a good time.Cyberpunk as a genre wallows in dystopia. Sprawling neon megacities obscuring dirt, grime, bodily waste, and horror are the genre's bread and butter. The Ascent is no different, and as a sheer visual achievement, the design of Veles is striking. Every square inch of the place is teeming with unique visual elements, distinctive NPCs, expressive and unique enemy types, and a tangible sense of technological splendor gone sour. There's a rather expansive sense of history and sci-fi world building at play, even if that world is rather grim. You're surrounded by hostile alien species, unthinkable technology, and ongoing civil unrest at all times. The whole place feels like a '90s Image comic version of Heavy Metal. It's all the trappings and cliches of hard sci-fi, rendered as foul-mouthed, edgy, and needlessly aggressive as possible. It's an excellent rendition of a place you don't want to spend any extended time in. But you will. And much of that time will be spent dying.There's just so little joy from a game playing in a genre that typically excels at it pretty easily.Make no mistake, The Ascent is a tough game. In any one given area, the critical path forward will lead you through a killzone with 30 trash mob mutants who you can mow down in seconds, which it will follow up immediately with a room of absolute bullet sponges who can cut you down in seconds (despite being your exact experience level, and despite you using the weapon the enemy should be weak to). One of the biggest bottlenecks early in the game involves returning to the aforementioned sewers to reroute power to your boss's neighborhood. You spend five minutes turning lowly mutants into mincemeat, then another hour getting pulverized by an army of about a dozen new worker robot enemies who you are thoroughly unprepared to face.The game doesn't really communicate that robots are weak to energy weapons, and once you've sussed that out, you probably don't have a terribly effective one on hand yet. So, you head back to town, buy a few energy-based guns, and watch as you are still destroyed in seconds. That’s a fairly common occurrence, where it’s all too easy to stroll into an absolute deathtrap 15-20 minutes into a dungeon, then have to stroll all the way out to get better prepared.Even that isn’t as easy as it sounds, considering stores stop carrying useful gear about halfway through the game, Bounty missions and menial sidequests provide only a paltry amount of extra cash, and checkpoints are still few and far between. Granted, the load times were fairly quick on PC, so your other option is constantly bashing your head against the wall retrying a challenge without any real consequence, and keeping the XP all the way. But there are deep difficulty spikes in this game, and having to stop every few hours to grind stops the game’s fun dead in its tracks.Even if The Ascent was fully functional and balanced in a way where building up a character to become the ultimate Indent warrior felt great, there's the fact that so much of the game is designed to feel like servitude. As you climb the superstructure housing all of Veles, you serve a progression of masters, and the payoff for the game's central mystery--where did the mysterious group running Veles suddenly run off to?--isn't nearly enough to offset the hopeless grind. Your bosses insult you when you go on your task, ignore you when you've done well, and provide no rewards for success.  For so much of the play time, The Ascent feels like, well, an uphill battle."
3059,Fallout: New Vegas,7.0,2,"Fallout 3's better content packs. Yet, this enjoyable excursion gives you several welcome chances to exercise the power of choice, and it rewards you with new perks, new weapons, and an increased level cap.         The two men at the center of Honest Hearts are good, sincere blokes that nonetheless don't see eye to eye on how to deal with the White Legs, a violent tribe of nomads eager to scalp anyone that dares oppose them. One of these men is Daniel, a Mormon missionary with close ties to a tribe called The Sorrows. The other is Joshua Graham, otherwise known as The Burned Man. Joshua favors an aggressive approach toward the White Legs, which is no surprise given his violent past with Caesar's Legion. He is beloved by the Dead Horses tribe and preaches that mankind should shun the greed of the outside world. You stumble upon both men after the trading caravan you join falls victim to the White Legs, though neither makes a very strong impression. Joshua needs supplies like lunch boxes and walkie-talkies; Daniel sends you to find maps and disarm traps. These are nice men that nonetheless make you wonder how they managed to inspire the devotion of the locals. Joshua tells you that he was put on Earth to show people how to fight, yet he speaks in even tones, without an ounce of passion. For someone called The Burned Man, his personality lacks fire, and the tasks he needs performed are hardly extraordinary.     As mundane as the narrative is, you still get welcome opportunities to make decisions, though they would have more weight if you felt more invested in the consequences. Standard quests allow for a bit of flexibility. You might kill the gigantic Yao Guai creatures threatening the camp or collapse the cave in which they live. You could convince a tribesman to follow his heart and explore the ""civilized"" world or encourage him to stay with his people. The final series of decisions determine the future of several characters and their tribes, and these are outlined in an epilogue that closes the adventure in traditional Fallout fashion. Some of these characters include a few that join you as followers, and they, like Joshua and Daniel, are remarkably even tempered. It's nice to have their company, however--particularly that of Waking Cloud, a pious Sorrow tribeswoman indebted to Daniel for her saving her life. It's too bad that some of the quests these characters join you for are so routine. Find a key, open a cabinet, search for a compass: These are simple fetch quests that needed some dressing up with better context.        A few quests offer some variety, however, including one that pits you against a giant creature in Honest Hearts' best battle. The reward is an excellent melee weapon that nicely complements an intimidating helmet you might also grab before you head back to the Mojave. Other tangible goodies in this content include weapons (such as tomahawks) and new perks (extra damage when limbs are crippled). In addition, the level cap has been increased by five. Zion also serves as its own reward; its prickly cacti and red-orange plateaus provide a great backdrop to your travels. This graphics engine is showing its age, what with the bland textures, frequent pauses and jitters, and awkward animations. Yet campsites dotted with empty beer bottles and abandoned communal grills are an effective reminder of the civilization from which Joshua wants to shield his followers.       This being a Fallout game, it's no surprise that you could run into a number of bugs. These include some enemies you cannot damage or target in the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System because they are standing in water; VATS sequences that get stuck for 30 seconds or more before continuing on; and non-player characters sprinting through the air rather than across land. Don't let such typical bugs dissuade you from considering Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts, however. The story and related quests don't surprise, but this add-on gives you the opportunity to once again influence those you meet and accomplish your goals as you see fit. And, you do those things in a desert environment harboring enough creatures and caves to make it worth exploring.     "
872,Overcooked! 2,8.0,2,"Following 2016's co-op cooking hit, Overcooked 2 introduces a fresh set of kitchens and recipes to conquer. Like in the first game, simple controls and a cute, cartoony style lend levity to intense dinner rushes where one mistake can lead to culinary disaster. The fun and chaos of playing with friends is preserved in the sequel, as is the far less exciting reality of playing solo. And while the added online play can't compare to in-person antics, the new throwing mechanic and a host of ridiculous kitchen layouts make for a delightfully frenetic follow-up to a couch co-op favorite.Like the original, Overcooked 2 takes you from one poorly laid out kitchen to the next, tasking you with cooking as many dishes as possible within a set time limit. Whether alone or with friends, each kitchen poses its own set of problems and hurdles; conveyor belts make basic movement more difficult, floating rafts and hot air balloons cause kitchens to shift under your feet, and the sink is usually nowhere near the dirty plates. It can be hard to figure out how to approach each level, but it's very easy for even the best strategies to devolve into chaos.Failing is just as fun as success, and Overcooked 2 still serves both the party crowd and more competitive players beautifully. Nothing about cooking is simple except for the controls--each task, like chopping ingredients or washing dishes, requires a single button. The rest is a balancing act that demands precise communication as well as adaptability, because things usually go wrong. The urgent beeping of food that's about to burn can quickly turn into panicked yelling and possibly a fire. It's often a comedy of errors, especially with the max of four people, and successfully serving up dishes at all is a triumph worth celebrating.Once you get past the initial stress of cooking in a nonsensical kitchen, you can actually start to strategize. With two players, you'll probably put more mental energy toward juggling various tasks, while with more co-chefs, you'll need to be careful not to run into anyone else. There's a very different kind of satisfaction in settling into a groove with your team, timing things perfectly, and maximizing your score. (Plus, calling out ""Order up!"" just doesn't get old.) It's also an enticing reason to chase higher and higher scores in the arcade mode and challenge another experienced two-person team in the versus mode.While much of the basic formula remains the same, Overcooked 2 adds the ability to throw raw ingredients. It's a relatively small addition, but it smartly adds to the chaos without overcomplicating it. A block of cheese flying by as you're chopping a tomato makes the kitchen feel more hectic, but it's actually extremely efficient--you can throw meat directly into a frying pan to save time or toss some fish across a moving platform that's blocking your path. Many of the levels take full advantage of the new mechanic, with kitchens split into two parts that intermittently come together. It often makes more sense to station one team member in one part of the kitchen, tossing ingredients over as needed, so you don't run the risk of trapping everyone in one area while things shift.Overcooked 2 also adds online play, a fine idea that's far less compatible with the best parts of the game. It's a different kind of challenge to cook with limited communication--especially on Switch, thanks to the lack of built-in voice chat--but playing online lacks the urgency of playing with people in the same room. A bit of lag, too, can ruin the flow or cause you to misclick. It's a welcome feature if your co-op partner is far away, though, and better suited for completionists rather than those looking to goof off.Playing alone is also the domain of completionists, as it's kind of a chore--you switch between two chefs, and it's a matter of smart task management without the fun of communicating and screwing up with other people. While the more complicated kitchens seem impossible to tackle on your own, a lower score threshold means you can still get the full three stars even if you only served a few dishes. Nothing is out of your reach alone, but success just isn't as satisfying.Overcooked 2 undoubtedly shines in local co-op and the versus arcade modes. New recipes and obstacles provide a fresh challenge for veterans, but it remains approachable for new players with simple controls and short playtimes. The new throwing mechanic, too, adds a new dimension to both strategy and the inevitable chaos without overcomplicating things. It's a strong foundation, and with the right friends, Overcooked 2 is one of the best couch co-op games around."
2789,Pushmo,8.0,2,"     Pushmo is all about pulling and pushing blocks in order to scale to the top of the large structures they form. Every puzzle (also called a Pushmo) begins as a relatively flat image that cannot be climbed. Your character, Mallo, can walk and jump, but more importantly he can grab hold of the individual blocks that make up a Pushmo. Ideally you pull an individual block out several spaces, jump on top of it, pull the next highest block out a little bit, and so on until you reach the top. However, you won't be pulling small, uniform pixel blocks to make a simple set of stairs over and over again. Blocks tend to be in odd shapes and positions, forcing you to put a lot of thought into what you want to move in or out of the background. You're taught new tricks as you go, such as the ability to push or pull blocks from the sides, but simple abilities don't do you any good for certain challenges, like when you happen to be standing on the same block you desperately want to move into or out of the background. You can rewind your progress a little if you decide you want to undo a specific action like a botched jump, or you can restart the puzzle altogether by hitting a button at the bottom of the stage.           You do have to progress some in the main game before you can try everything that's out there (you'll solve dozens of puzzles before you can create or even acquire levels with switches or manholes), but that's a small price to pay when the game is so much fun to play. Pushmo offers a wealth of content and smart game design that is often missing from full retail releases, so the fact that it can be downloaded for $6.99 is impressive. It's a carefree, addictive puzzler with great player creation tools that enable you to keep happily pushing and pulling blocks for as long as you please.  "
712,Nintendo Labo: Toycon 04 VR Kit,7.0,2,"With all the high-end hardware requirements typical of VR gaming, you'd think of the Nintendo Switch as the least likely candidate to adopt it. But one of the many things Nintendo is unequivocally good at is making the most of its tech and working within its limitations. The new Labo VR Kit is yet another example. While it doesn't always overcome its inherent shortcomings, Nintendo's latest cardboard-based do-it-yourself package cleverly transforms the Switch into a light, inventive virtual reality gaming experience with the tools to go beyond the initial library.So, how does the Switch become a VR headset? You first build the mount that contains the slot you slip the Switch into, which also holds the packaged goggles. The mount keeps everything in place nicely and the adhesive pads keep the Switch safe. Once you set the Labo software to VR mode, the screen transforms to a stereoscopic view for the lenses. Since there is no headstrap, you'll need to hold the Switch up to your face throughout your time in VR mode. It's worth noting that the Switch's 720p screen resolution is well below that of any other VR platform, resulting in a distinct lack of visual clarity--luckily, this limitation doesn't detract from the types of experiences Labo VR delivers.With the headset ready to go, you can physically look up, down, left, and right by moving your head. But because the Switch isn't able to do positional tracking, forward or backward movements aren't recognized and could be nausea-inducing. Tracking relies entirely on the Switch's built-in gyroscope and accelerometer, which results in a relatively smooth viewing experience. Looking in and around in VR works pretty well, and in combination with the Joy-Cons' own gyroscope and accelerometer (and the right Joy-Con's IR sensor), the cardboard devices become functional pieces of hardware.By and large, the creative process is what drives the Labo VR Kit to become more than its packaged contents--but to see that, you should experience its roster of games, minigames, and proof-of-concept sandboxes. Once you've assembled a new cardboard toy (called Toy-Cons), Labo then walks you through a specific game made for it. The Toy-Con Camera transports you to the middle of an ocean where you can snap photos of marine life, or look upward to float to the surface and see a bigger world. Twisting the Toy-Con Camera lens works just like zooming in with an actual camera lens because of the Joy-Con placed inside recognizes those small movements. Despite the Toy-Con Elephant being the toughest one to work with, the Marble Run game it's tied to is a series of smart physics-based puzzles for you manipulate platforms, gravity, and trampolines to get a marble through a goal.The novel applications don't end there, either. The Toy-Con Bird delivers flight movements for its open-area collectathon and racing game because the Joy-Con, which is placed on the ""bird""'s beak rocks back and forth when you flap the cardboard wings. A personal favorite is the Toy-Con Blaster; it's a pump gun for with tactile feedback that matches the launching of explosive balls for its on-rails shooter game. There's impressive cleverness in how Nintendo makes use of the motion-tracking capabilities and cardboard components, and how they translate to sensible control schemes. These aren't intended to be long-form experiences; rather, they're bite-sized showcases of VR functionality for each of the cardboard devices you assemble.The Labo VR Kit is much more than just VR gaming for the Switch; it's educational, accessible, and imaginative, with a robust suite of programming tools. And that's what makes it wholly unique from anything else on the VR market.On paper, it may seem like a hassle to constantly hold the Switch headset to your face without a strap to hold it in place, but it's not as bad as it sounds--each Labo VR device is designed with this in mind. Take the Toy-Con Blaster, for example; your view in its rail shooter game is essentially a persistent aim-down-sights, and the ergonomics of the Blaster itself make it a comfortable experience. With the Elephant, you get a handle beneath the cardboard face to hold it up as you extend the trunk to move your in-game hands. And of course, the physical act of holding up the Toy-Con Camera to your face coincides with the real-world action.The content in VR Plaza distills it down even further by isolating certain aspects of each toy's potential in 60+ minigames/sandboxes. They essentially act as the building blocks for the inventive Toy-Con Garage and this is where the Labo VR Kit lets your imagination run wild--it's literally the toolset used to program the minigames contained in the VR Plaza section. It's a part of previous kits as well, but this version adds tools to create VR experiences. Toy-Con Garage is extremely complex and much more than a level creator you may find in other games. It's possible to teach yourself and eventually get to a point where you can wrap your head around the logic and programming for something and see it come to fruition, but it'll take significant time and effort if you don't have prior experience with programming. What's neat is that you can edit every sandbox/minigame in VR Plaza using the Garage tools and basically use them as the foundation to create your own thing. By virtue of seeing the programming guts of each game, you can then start to unravel how they're built. Things like Make An FPS Game and Make An Action Game in VR Plaza are specifically designed to let you use them as templates. And editing doesn't have to be solely done in VR thanks to the ability to select a 2D editing mode.Like the other kits, the Labo VR Kit does so many great things outside of its more standard game experiences, and it's really about what you do with the technology.In addition to the games and programming tools, Discovery Mode works as a laudable educational tool. Discovery offers a series of cheeky dialogue scenarios between a few Labo-based characters that effectively walk you through the Switch's technology, asking you questions along the way to make sure you're keeping up. Think of it as a crash course in physical science and electronics that explains everything from how the right Joy-Con's IR sensor works to showing you why gyroscope drift happens. Not only does Discover further contextualize what the hardware is doing, but makes knowledge of complex tech accessible to a wider audience.However, there are a few cases in which the Joy-Con tracking can be frustrating due to gyroscope drift. It's fairly easy to constantly recalibrate the Joy-Con position in a free-hand experience like shooting hoops, hitting a ball with a paddle, or moving blocks in a 3D space. But it becomes an issue in something like the Doodle application or the Marble Run stage creator, where you have to use the Elephant to craft a 3D sculpture or build a course, respectively. Your plane will always drift off-center. You can recenter yourself by accessing the pause menu, but it's frustrating to frequently wrestle with the motion-tracking in these cases. As a result, it's difficult to keep your work consistent and gets in the way of certain parts of the creative process with VR mode.The Labo VR Kit is much more than just VR gaming for the Switch; it's educational, accessible, and imaginative, with a robust suite of programming tools. And that's what makes it wholly unique from anything else on the VR market. Despite all its limitations and seemingly makeshift appearance, each contraption is an example of a creative vision in action, most of which works exceptionally well in bite-sized portions. In a broad sense, Labo VR is a smart, clever use of existing tech and expertly designed cardboard devices. The biggest factor in the lasting appeal of Labo VR (and the Labo lineup in general) lies in the Toy-Con Garage, because there's no denying the barebones aspect of the packaged gaming content, which is more of a collection of proofs-of-concept for VR's potential. Like the other kits, the Labo VR Kit does so many great things outside of its more standard game experiences, and it's really about what you do with the technology."
625,AI: The Somnium Files,8.0,2,"AI: The Somnium Files is an adventure game that combines two classic storytelling genres: the murder mystery and the buddy-cop movie. On top of that, the ""buddy"" for AI's lead character, detective Kaname Date, isn't human. Or animal, for that matter. Rather, it's a snarky, quirky, super-powered feminine artificial intelligence in the shape of an eyeball--named Aiba--that lives in his left eye socket and has a direct connection to his brain. Oh, and she also helps Date by transforming into a humanoid avatar form to explore the dream worlds of various characters you meet throughout the game. Talk about an odd couple, huh?It's an intriguing concept for sure. Thankfully, the near-future sci-fi detective story that AI: the Somnium Files tells lives up to the promise of its unique premise, delivering a great dialogue-driven adventure that sucks you in and doesn’t let up until all of its twisted mysteries have been unraveled.Date is a detective for a secret, experimental Tokyo police division called ABIS. When the body of his best friend's ex-wife is found displayed in an abandoned amusement park, Date soon finds himself swept up in a complex investigation to find the culprit before they strike again. Along the way, he crosses paths with a bubbly up-and-coming internet personality, her diehard fanboy (and his beleaguered mother), a Yakuza group, a corrupt politician, and the victim's young daughter, amongst many other odd, interesting, and sinister personalities. And that's not even mentioning the oddest personality of them all: Aiba, his quick-witted and sharp-tongued AI partner and confidant in exploring the case.Having a smart-alecky AI constantly feeding commentary into your brain might sound nightmarish, but Aiba comes with some special skills to aid Date with his investigations: X-ray vision, heat sensing, zooming to check up on faraway places, and even the ability to help Date in quick-time event-style combat. But Aiba's biggest role is to help Date get information from the various characters by acting as his avatar in their dream worlds. When interrogation gets tough, ABIS staff hooks a subject up to a Psync machine, which allows Date and Aiba to explore their subjects' subconscious ""somnium"" dream world to uncover clues and deeply hidden (and sometimes forgotten) secrets. The excursion is under a strict time limit--otherwise their consciousnesses become forever intertwined.Gameplay in the exploration and investigation sections of AI: The Somnium Files follows a fairly typical point-and-click adventure game style: You look at objects in the environments for clues and talk to characters by making comments and asking questions. The way AI handles these sections makes you less likely to get stuck than in other adventure games, however. You're only given the option to move to a new area once you've done everything necessary to advance the story in one particular location, which ensures you won’t need to backtrack or worry that you're missing anything important. If you can’t move to the map, you know there’s still more to do.While exploring the various environments will yield a fair amount of clues, it's the interactions Date has with the various characters (and Aiba’s reactions to those interactions) that really move AI's twisting mystery along. Each character you interact with is unique and memorable in their own way. There's Iris, the cheery aspiring internet idol whose mischievous personality causes Date much consternation; Ota, a devoted fan of Iris with numerous nerdy pursuits; So, a slimy politician with his fair share of secrets; Boss and Pewter, two eccentric personalities that work with Date at ABIS; and Mizuki, Date's friend's daughter with a sour attitude and strength beyond her years. There are many more interesting faces you’ll meet, too, each with an important role to play in the story and a strong personality to match. The excellent character designs by Yusuke Kozaki (Fire Emblem Awakening, No More Heroes) also give each NPC a striking visual element to match their distinct characterizations.At certain points in the story, you encounter other modes of gameplay, like interrogation scenes where you present evidence to a character and action scenes involving quick-time event-style button presses to help Date fend off threats. However, the most important parts of the game take place when Date uses the Psync machine to explore another character's somnium worlds. Using Aiba as an avatar, you interact directly with elements within these characters' surreal, illogical, and often very disturbing dream worlds, with every action she performs costing precious time. If Date and Aiba can’t solve the puzzles in the somnium within the time limit, they’ll be forced out, and you will have to start the somnium exploration over from the beginning.Solving the puzzles to progress in the somniums involves performing certain actions in a certain order on certain objects--and since these are bizarre, often illogical dreamscapes, sometimes the solution isn’t obvious or runs contrary to common sense. You can earn and use items called TIMIEs to help conserve time, but if time grows short, your best option might be to restart. This involves repeating much of the same actions and dialogue to get back to where you were, but skipping all the previous, time-wasting actions you tried before. If you don’t want to do the whole event over, you can go back to checkpoints within a somnium to try and save time by only performing necessary actions. However, you can only do this up to three times before you are forced to restart. Making this even worse is that sometimes you’re saddled with time-penalty TIMIEs from certain actions, meaning that your next action will cost significantly more time than usual and possibly even lead to unwinnable situations. As a result, the six-minute time limit winds up being a source of stress, discouraging you from exploring and appreciating the well-crafted dreamscape environments as much as you’d like and sometimes standing as a roadblock to further progressing the story.Besides revealing important story beats, the somnium sequences serve another important purpose: Depending on your actions within the somnium, the overall story will branch down one of many different potential paths, with different events taking place on each story branch. Only by seeing all of the various story possibilities, good and bad, will the whole truth behind AI's saga be revealed. Fortunately, you’re able to jump around to various points in the game’s saga (and replay somnium sequences) whenever you want, so you can put one story branch aside and pick up another anytime you feel like--though there will be roadblocks in some spots if certain plot points have yet to be revealed. As the various branches of the story give tantalizing tidbits of information and reveal more about each of the main characters, you feel like you’re piecing together an elaborate puzzle, which makes it all the more satisfying when big revelations happen.Despite the occasional frustration in exploring its dream landscapes, the whole of AI: the Somnium Files winds up being a fun, thrilling, and engaging experience. The story is filled with intriguing twists and shocking surprises, and the characters and their individual arcs inspire you to care about what happens to them. The somnium dream worlds add a layer of psychological horror to the ongoing mystery, and Date and Aiba’s constant back-and-forth interactions provide levity to make every investigation all the more amusing. AI's unconventional detective story is one you won’t soon forget."
1840,Styx: Master of Shadows,5.0,1,"  Of Orcs and Men, but playing that game is in no way required to understand this one. Styx, the world's first goblin, wants to steal a treasure that's precious to the elves for reasons that he can't quite remember. The story falls victim to many clichés, including the selective amnesia trope, and while a couple of twists in the plot try to add some excitement, Styx's journey as a thief and assassin isn't wholly satisfying. The maps you play through are large, and there are typically at least a couple of paths through each area. But even though you're presented with options like crawling through this tunnel or on top of these rafters, such options inevitably lead to the same destination. You have a few items and tricks at your disposal to help you slink around in these environments. Throwing knives, for example, can be used to knock out an enemy from a distance, while balls of sand can be thrown onto most torches to snuff them out without getting too close to their light. A tattoo on your back and arm glows red when you are hidden in the shadows, but if an enemy gets close enough, he is still able to spot you, even in the dark. Such is the experience of playing Styx: Master of Shadows, a stealth game that occasionally hits the right notes before making you forget about them. One of the skills you rely on most often is the ability to create clones. At pretty much any time, Styx can barf up a clone of himself that runs around and does his bidding. By taking control of a clone you can pull switches, distract guards or explode into a cloud of smoke to provide cover for the real you to run past enemies. Making clones costs amber, which is Styx's equivalent to mana. If you simply walk around a bit and destroy your clone purposefully, that amber will regenerate. More complex tricks, though, reduce your amber meter permanently, forcing you to use an item to recover it. The other major skill requiring amber is invisibility, which works as you would expect it to. Being invisible doesn't last long and has a significant cost, so you can't rely on it to simply run through a map undetected. Such abilities can be augmented by purchasing skills between missions. By using experience-like points, earned by completing objectives, you can improve things such as how quietly you move while invisible, or you can purchase all-new tricks such as the ability to grab an enemy and kill them from behind cover. Some abilities are far more useful than others, however. For instance, one purchasable skill lets you hide a clone in a closet or chest, where it will automatically leap out at an enemy that passes it. Sounds useful, right? Unfortunately, the opportunities to use this skill effectively are few and far between, and there are multiple cases where it looks like this trick should work, but the enemy in question walks, apparently, about a foot too far away for the trap to actually trigger. Still, it's better to master your stealth skills as much as possible, because one thing you don't want to do is get into a sword fight, as Styx's combat mechanics leave much to be desired. On difficulty levels other than the highest (in which being spotted means certain death), getting caught while close to an enemy locks you into combat stance, forcing an awkward behind-the-back perspective from which you can barely move. During this duel, you must exercise precise timing to either dodge or parry enemy attacks. Parrying involves merely tapping a button at the right time, a process similar to (but not nearly as satisfying as) that in games like Assassin's Creed. Your enemy swings his sword, and if you swing your sword just before his makes contact with you, you parry his blow. Do this several times and the ""parry"" command becomes ""kill,"" allowing you to finish the fight. There's little finesse--just a small window of time in which you will either block a blow or take some damage. Dodging is somewhat useless, as the game makes it almost impossible to disengage and flee. If you try to escape, the camera will almost certainly remain locked on the nearest enemy, as if to say, ""No, you're settling this with your blade now, like it or not."" The entire system feels stiff and unwieldy, making battle a painful experience whether you win or lose. And that's if you're just facing off with a single enemy. If there are two or more, your death is all but assured, as enemies swing and shoot at you while you're locked into animations, making it impossible to defend yourself. If you were hoping that a more action-oriented path would be an option, prepare for disappointment. This might not have been an issue had Styx not presented combat as a way out of tricky situations, but numerous skills you can invest in are focused on becoming a better killing machine. Enemy AI in stealth games is often an issue, but in Styx, your enemies are exceptionally dumb. They can often be found: walking directly into each other, doing a quick series of 180-degree turns (as if they can't make up their mind which direction in which to go), ignoring the fact that doors are mysteriously opening directly in front of them, not noticing a comrade's body 10 feet away, and so forth. Though the AI of your enemies is always bad, at least Styx offers plenty of gameplay variety. Throughout the adventure, you have new challenges and enemy types thrown at you, forcing you to think a little differently and encouraging you not to rely on the same tricks throughout the game. For instance, you want to make sure you aren't seen in most situations, but you occasionally run into insectoid enemies that are blind but have exceptional hearing. For these foes, it doesn't matter if you're right in front of them in broad daylight, but the slightest noise will send them running to you, and they're not easy to fight off. Other enemy types switch things up by having certain resistances (some can't be killed by throwing knives, for example), while others instantly deliver death upon detection. Unfortunately, that sense of variety doesn't extend to the level design. It's not that every level looks the same--there is some diversity in the environments, from libraries to prisons--it's that you actually revisit almost every level at least once throughout the game, with slightly different enemy layouts being the only real difference between the visits. It's not even always a ""sneak through this area, then sneak back out again"" scenario (although those happen too). Often, you literally backtrack through an entire area a second time, stopping only occasionally to visit rooms that you had no reason to visit before. Despite each map being sizable, this repetition makes the world as a whole feel small, and going through the same rooms again (noticing that once-destroyed objects like chandeliers seem to have magically reappeared) is tedious. Even if a new enemy formation forces you into slightly different actions than your last time through the area, there's still an overwhelming feeling of ""I've done this already."" It's a shame when this stuff puts a damper on the base mechanics, because there are moments when Styx's stealth is genuinely satisfying. When you expertly weave through a group of soldiers without touching them, or when you properly time an ""accident"" (like poisoned food or a falling chandelier) to eliminate a lot of enemies at once, there's a real sense of accomplishment. But the game doesn't allow for enough of those moments, and instead you are left with too much repetition--sometimes boring, sometimes frustrating. Tenchu or Metal Gear Solid games. That prospect may sound exciting, but Styx unfortunately finds itself in the shadows of better stealth experiences."
1338,Hearts of Iron IV,8.0,2,"I started as the United States in 1936, and I decided that I wanted to doggedly pursue nuclear weapons. I set my sights on having a stable of city-busting bombs ready to go by 1942--three years before their real-world deployment. With careful choices--namely an eye for research, and carefully hiring top scientists like Robert Oppenheimer (a noted historical nuclear physicist), I pulled it off. But, in so doing, Italy went largely unopposed in its campaign in Africa. I hadn’t given much thought to the development of the world’s stage or the early theatres of war and as a result, some things got a little out of hand.With Italy pulling resources from Africa, it managed to shore up the largest army in the world, which the emerging Mediterranean superpower used to bolster Hitler’s advance into France and Russia. France collapsed under the pressure, but the USSR made some stunning choices. Joseph Stalin started a smattering of other wars across the globe, making and breaking alliances to keep global pressure up on Germany. In so doing, they managed to reverse the results of the Spanish Civil War, push heavily into the Pacific and ultimately got into a tussle with the UK and myself.That’s the power of Hearts of Iron IV. This isn’t just an alternative perspective on history-- it gives you the agency and tools to influence one of the world's most turbulent eras in any way you’d like. Each move, every military press, has ripple effects that cascade outward for years. Hold a garrison in one place, and you could cause the world to tremble down the line. This is the butterfly effect made manifest, but there’s a catch: you’re not the only one making choices. The AI responds based on your threat, and who they’re working with.In the real world, the Alliance between Western and Eastern Europe against Hitler was the most tenuous of friendships, as evidenced by the Cold War just a bit later. And that comes down to a fundamental difference in ideology--England and its capitalist friends fundamentally disagreed with the Soviets on everything except that Hitler had to be stopped. So if Germany doesn’t present the same existential danger, why shack up with the Allies at all?As was the case in the actual mid-20th century, Hearts of Iron IV pulls the perspective on war all the way out. There are no individuals here, only numbers. The stories of individual soldiers--with rare exceptions for skilled combatants--get lost in the spreadsheets. The challenge of shifting millions of men and their gearacross the world to battle ideas and their followers is all that matters. Germany, England, Ethiopia, and everyone else cease to be collections of people. They are goals, they are potential boons, and they are obstacles.This is war at its highest levels. This is the essence of what it means to dedicate a nation--everything about its economy, infrastructure, government, and ideology--to the cause of conflict.It’s a callous perspective, but it’s one that keeps Hearts of Iron IV focused amidst such complexity and variability. This is war at its highest levels. This is the essence of what it means to dedicate a nation--everything about its economy, infrastructure, government, and ideology--to the cause of conflict. That’s a lot to manage, but Hearts of Iron IV helps you direct the chaos. Production, research, and deployment of forces are all straightforward. You can queue up the equipment you’ll need to supply your campaigns and these lines grow more efficient with time. Most of the smaller stuff will end up in a nebulous “stockpile.” As you conscript and train new soldiers or armored divisions, your gear will be automatically shifted to where it’s needed most. You can adjust supply priority, however, so if you’re trying to fulfill America’s role as the arsenal of democracy, you can prioritize delivery to England and France over your own warriors stationed at home.Bigger weapons like planes and ships are a bit more hands-on, as you can’t very well keep a nebulous stockpile of battlecruisers and bombers. Instead, they’re attached to airports and naval bases. Each of which has a maximum capacity. From there you can direct your fleets and wings on myriad missions, safeguarding supply vessels or intercepting enemy bombers.Hearts of Iron IV embodies the hard truths about all-consuming war and the international politics that guide it. Even under the best conditions, sending a detachment of soldiers across the world can take months. Aircraft carriers and the flotillas they rely on--packed with destroyers, support crews, battleships, and submarines --take years to build. Your plans have to match that timescale. You can’t just spam marines and call it a day. Instead, Hearts of Iron IV asks you to formulate strategies and stick them through to the end.Your factories spool up their output very slowly, becoming more and more efficient the longer you keep them running. As you start to roll out your gear and mobilize your nation, you face a constant stream challenges you couldn’t have expected months or years prior. If your foes have been steadily outfitting their soldiers with armor-busting anti-tank weapons right as your new Tiger tanks hit their borders, you’ll face some tough decisions about how to adapt. Shifting your production doesn’t come without cost, so which pieces of your plan do you shuck and which do you hold?These questions are the foundation of Hearts of Iron IV. They can strain the most Machiavellian of tacticians, highlighting the disconnect between planning, action, and results to keep the game consistently engaging. No two games will ever work the same way. In some, you might find the Soviet Union holding Germany at Warsaw--for years. In others, Poland’s plan to unite Eastern Europe will work and they will grow to be one of the war’s biggest players. When you look back at it all, you will be able to understand how you got to that point and how things might have gone differently.Even if you’re used to this sort of romp, it can take a dozen hours or more to get the hang of it.Heart of Iron’s only weak point is its tutorial. With so much to manage and so many moving pieces to keep track of, it does a poor job of getting new players ready. To be clear, it’s much more friendly than its predecessors, but this is a game with daunting depth. You can organize everything from division templates to government officials and your war cabinet. Plus, you can play from the perspective of just about any country--each with their own goals and needs--the US, as the world’s industrial powerhouse, is a far different beast to Switzerland. Hearts of Iron IV keeps both interesting and engaging, throwing plenty of important decisions at its players regardless of nation or faction, but digging into the guts of it takes time--a lot of time. Even if you’re used to this sort of romp, it can take a dozen hours or more to get the hang of it.For the dedicated, Hearts of Iron IV could end up being the best grand strategy game in some time. It’s many disparate pieces harmonize, and your decisions, and the responses of foes and allies, are different each and every time. While human drama might get lost in the spreadsheets and figures, there’s nothing quite like seeing the culmination of a strategy you’ve invested in since 1936 pay its dividends in 1945."
1969,Sportsfriends,8.0,2,"Some people have things in their home that make it a more desirable location for parties. Rachel has a billiards table. Don has table tennis. But Johann? Johann has Sportsfriends, a collection of four simple, enjoyable games that are easy to pick up and play. Provided you have a good group of people and a few controllers to go around, it can be exactly what a party needs to go from good to great. I stress the party theme, because having people to play Sportsfriends with is a requirement. There are no single-player options whatsoever (not even any sort of practice mode), and there is no online play. To get anything at all from Sportsfriends, you need at least two people (preferably more). Fortunately, even if you have four people but are lacking a couple of controllers, half of the games in the collection allow you to share a controller between two players. Things may get a little cramped (I hope you're comfortable being close to the person you're sharing with), but this is a valid and enjoyable way to experience these two games, and it's a great option to have. The first game on the Sportsfriends list, BaraBariBall, is the most complex and hardest to master, but it's potentially the most rewarding for those who want something with depth to seek their teeth into. The game pits two teams (of either one or two players each) on opposite sides of a stage and drops a ball into the middle. Each team then fights over the ball (often literally, as physical attacks are encouraged) in an effort to get the ball into their team's goal--a goal made of water below the stage. You can jump into the water to grab the ball before it sinks offscreen, but it's a risky move. If you sink too far yourself, your team loses a point. Getting around each stage and past the opposing team requires some jumping, but you have a limited number of jumps you can use in a row before you have to land on solid ground to recharge. Because the liquid goal lines are typically a fair distance below ground level, managing how many jumps you have at any given time is vital to success in both offense and defense. At times, BaraBariBall has the same frantic nature of a fighting game, including the physical violence that comes with that. Desperation can set in when the ball is sinking into the goal and an opponent is about to score. You know you have enough time to dive into the water and grab it--but will you have enough jumps to make it back out alive, especially considering your competitors will be waiting for you back on land? Decisions must be made quickly, and the difference could be a well-timed punch to the face.  By comparison, Super Pole Riders is much easier to pick up. This game combines the easy-to-understand act of pole vaulting with an objective very similar to that in BaraBariBall--namely, a ball in the center of the arena that you want to get to your goal. This ball, though, is hanging on a rope high above you, forcing you to either vault yourself up to the ball to kick it or use your pole (which, despite being able to support your weight, seems to have the firmness of a foam pool noodle) to shove it into the goal. The controls for either strategy are simple: the left analog stick moves your character, while the right analog stick moves the pole. When left to your own devices, vaulting toward the ball is effortless. In practice, four-player games of Super Pole Riders often devolve into a tangle of bodies all trying to get airborne at the exact same spot, resulting in numerous face-kicks and riders on top of opposing poles. This is frustrating if you're taking the competition too seriously, but the insanity is usually enjoyable thanks to how ridiculous this mayhem looks, if nothing else. So what if you're struggling to get the ball where you want it to go? It looks really funny while you're trying. Hokra is another game that allows you to share a controller, which is good because it demands exactly four players. It is a very simple game both in concept and in visuals, since each player is represented only as a colored square. As two teams of two, you compete to get a ball into your team's colored scoring area, earning points as long as it's there until a set score has been reached. You do a lot of dashing, passing, and tackling along the way, making Hokra feel almost like a cross between football and King of the Hill. If you want a bit more complexity, you can enable an option to select from different player types that vary in strengths (one runs faster, one scores faster, and so on), and you can even build your own stages with an extremely easy-to-use editor.  In Hokra, Dashing into enemies to steal the ball from them, then attempting (and often failing) to make a successful pass to a teammate, is reminiscent of early NHL video games, and even though teams are only made up of two players, you might find yourself and your teammate settling into specific roles. My wife, for example, wasn't adept at chasing the ball or scoring, but she found that she was good at protecting me by shoving other players away when I had the ball, like someone blocking in a game of football. Hokra may be simple, but it demands teamwork, making it an enjoyable game for pairs. The most interesting and arguably most notable game in Sportsfriends, though, is Johann Sebastian Joust. In Joust, you and your fellow players need to stand up and move around, taking your controller with you. Your controller is very sensitive to motion--move it too quickly, and you're out of the game. The goal is to knock your opponents out by moving their controllers (or making them move their controllers themselves) while protecting your own. Unless you're content with having a slap fight while sitting down, this requires standing up and walking around, so a lot of open space is ideal. Whether you move your couch out of the way or leave it as an obstacle is up to you. You don't need to (in fact, shouldn't) look at the screen at all, but you need to listen to the music coming out of the TV. The speed of the music changes as you play and dictates how fast you can move as well. When the music speeds up, your controller is a bit less sensitive, allowing you to move faster and quickly move away from or toward another player. If the music freezes, the slightest shake or tilt of the controller sets it off, demanding absolute stillness. For an interesting twist, you can have one person serve as the music's conductor, setting the pace of the game as everyone else plays.  Joust is also the only game in the collection where it really matters whether you're playing Sportsfriends on the PlayStation 3 or the PlayStation 4. Only the PS3 version lets you use your own custom music during the game, though the music available fits so perfectly that you might not want to use anything else. Both versions of the game allow you to use the DualShock 3/4 in addition to PlayStation Move controllers (which are the better option if you have access to enough of them), but the PS3 version allows for up to seven players at a time, while the PS4 version is capped at 4. On the flip side, the PS3 controller, which uses vibration instead of light to tell you when you're knocked out, is the worst of the available control options. In fact, while using standard PS3 controllers, you are locked out of specific gameplay options and tweaks that are available to you when using Move controllers. The PS4 controller has no such limitations.    "
991,Brawlout,5.0,1,"It's worth noting from the outset that the game is designed for competitive Smash fans. If you're looking for a goofy free-for-all with zany items and copious stage hazards, this isn't the game you want. What's here is a very basic selection of fighting arenas with restrained gimmickry, no items, and a handful of game modes that are focused specifically on pure fighting.If you're familiar with Smash, the controls in Brawlout will feel like second nature. You have a regular attack button and a special attack button, and pressing these in combination with a directional input will change your attacks. Jumping and running also change your attack properties, and you can charge certain attacks for more power. The goal is to damage your opponent, then hit them hard enough to send them flying off the field. Sounds exactly like Smash so far, right? The big difference is that Brawlout doesn't offer shielding or grab maneuvers. Instead, the buttons you would normally associate with these moves are re-assigned to a dodge move with an invincibility window that can be executed on the ground or in the air.While dodging is a mechanic that veteran Smash players will no doubt feel familiar with, the removal of shielding and grabs is quite puzzling. The lack of guard and throw mechanics, which are are nearly universal across all kinds of fighting games, limits your options in frustrating ways. The loss of shielding, for example, makes certain attacks a lot safer than they would be in other games of this sort, and puts a lot of power in the hands of someone going all-in on aggression. It doesn't necessarily result in a more aggressive game; it just gives someone on the defending side fewer options and leads to more frustration.Brawlout attempts to cover for the loss of these options with an upgraded Rage mechanic. Rage was something of a hidden mechanic in Smash 4 that would increase a character’s damage output when they had taken a lot of damage. In Brawlout, Rage is very clearly visible through a meter shown underneath a character’s damage readout. As a character takes damage, their meter increases. They can use the meter to power up their special attacks, utilize a combo-escaping burst when the meter’s at least half full, or enter full-on Rage Mode (indicated by a large burning flame graphic on the character’s damage indicator) when it’s at max. Special moves have different properties when used with and without Rage meter to fuel them, so keeping tabs on your meter becomes a big part of the game at higher levels of play.Brawlout presents its comic combatants and arenas with confidence and style, but even the game's relatively bland-looking characters prove useful during battle. Joining the cast of original fighters are two guests from other indie games: Juan from Guacamelee and the Drifter from Hyper Light Drifter. They both feel at home in the game, but as of this writing, Drifter is somewhat overpowered compared to the rest of the cast.However, in order to access the full selection of characters and stages, you have to unlock them. And there is a lot of unlocking to do. Fighting on- and offline, completing the tutorials and arcade modes, leveling up characters, and fulfilling daily objectives will all earn you currency you can spend on ""pinatas"" (read: loot boxes) to earn characters, skins, and other goodies. To unlock more than three initial stages, you have to level up specific characters across numerous fights. No, you can't just find one fighter you really click with and play with them; you need to play each character until you reach a specific level for them to unlock one stage apiece. And that's a separate grind from the two different in-game currencies.With the game being so slanted towards competitive play, Brawlout does its best to push you towards playing online. The problem is that, in its current state, online play is a mess. I had a handful of good sessions in my attempts to play online. By and large, my online bouts were defined by stuttering, clunky-feeling movement and laggy slideshows--issues echoed online by other players. It's hard to recommend a competition-focused game like this when part of its foundation is so flawed.Brawlout is clearly trying its best to create a unique identity from the game that inspired it. However, the ways in which it's trying to do this--by removing key mechanics and putting an emphasis on grindy unlocks--don't work in its favor. Combine this with an online mode that just doesn't seem to function correctly most of the time and you've got a game that's disappointing in its current form. Keep the Wii U or GameCube hooked up to get your Smash fix for now."
4410,NASCAR Heat 2002,4.0,0,"It takes a special kind of person to appreciate NASCAR racing. Not just anyone can tolerate watching the same cars that you can find on our highways do loops for hours on end. But NASCAR is America's number-one motorsport, and NASCAR games have traditionally been strong performers in the video game sector, so it comes as no surprise that Infogrames would try its hand at a handheld version of the perpetual left-hand turn. Unfortunately, NASCAR Heat 2002 seems to mostly offer the things that people dislike about the sport, rather than the elements that cause thousands of people to pack their coolers every weekend and head off to watch the next big race.    One aspect of NASCAR Heat 2002 that's above reproach is the number of gameplay modes available. The arcade mode allows you to jump straight into a circuit of races using any of the eight real-world drivers included in the game. You can drive as Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jeff Gordon, Kevin Harvick, Dale Jarrett, Sterling Marlin, Ricky Rudd, Rusty Wallace, and Steve Park, though the differences between each of the drivers is practically impossible to discern. The single race mode allows you to choose a driver and track to simply get some practice time in while managing tire wear and other realistic conditions. The beat the heat mode presents you with a series of challenges that increase in difficulty as the mode progresses. There are also a variety of multiplayer modes, including a four-player option using just one cartridge. However, just one track and one car are available. If you choose to play multiplayer with more than one cartridge, you can select from all the game's cars and tracks.  The heart of the single-player experience is the career mode. You begin by attempting to qualify for a team and then jump into the grueling NASCAR circuit. At the conclusion of each season, your performance is evaluated and the team will decide if they should keep you on or drop you in favor of another driver. If you perform particularly well, you'll receive offers from other teams with faster cars, better pit crews, and better tires. In this way, you can work your way up through the ranks and win the NASCAR cup. There are 18 different teams to drive for, and if you perform poorly, you'll be dropped down into a lower group until you get your career straightened out. For a handheld game, NASCAR Heat 2002 has plenty of options to keep players busy. But they're all nearly ruined when it's time to actually play the game.    NASCAR Heat 2002 plays from an isometric perspective. Because it plays from this awkward angle, pressing left on the directional pad always causes your car to turn left, while pressing right will always cause it to turn right. The control scheme is reminiscent of that from the Resident Evil series and is completely inappropriate for a driving game in this era. Making matters worse, too little of the track is seen at a time, forcing you to memorize each bend and turn to keep from swapping paint with the guardrails. Eventually you'll be able to navigate the tracks fairly well, but getting to that point can be extremely frustrating, and the payoff is not worth the hassle.    While the game makes use of the NASCAR license to deliver real drivers and tracks, their visual representation leaves a great deal to be desired. Other than the basic track layout, it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between racing at Darlington or Michigan International. The cars are so small onscreen that it's difficult to tell one car from another. In the end, the license is used as something to legitimize the game instead of enhance it. With all due respect to NASCAR and its fans, crashes are arguably one of the most exhilarating parts of the sport. Unfortunately, the crashes in NASCAR Heat rarely amount to more than fender benders.    With its varied gameplay options and official NASCAR license, NASCAR Heat 2002 could have been a great game. But the dated graphics and the surprisingly inept gameplay make for a bad combination that really hurts the game. So much more is possible in the racing genre on the Game Boy Advance, and hopefully Infogrames will realize the power of the NASCAR brand and bring a better game to market next year."
3137,Red Faction: Battlegrounds,5.0,1," Armageddon, but it fails to take advantage of either angle.        Battlegrounds does offer a tenuous link to the retail Red Faction games, though the connection is little more than an aesthetic similarity. You once again take control of the freedom fighters known as Red Faction and square off against your imperialistic foes, the Earth Defense Force. There isn't context explaining why you have to compete in capture-the-flag and deathmatch duels against your oppressors, only the cliche remarks of a berating commanding officer speaking down to his lowly subordinate. You play as the lower-ranked soldier and slowly unlock more vehicles and better equipment as you make your way through the 16 single-player training missions. You gain access to new weapons for the competitive mode, so at least there's a reason to take part in these extended tutorials. Also, the vehicles each have unique strengths and weaknesses that affect not only their firepower, but how they control as well. The sluggish tank is a sharp contrast to the nimble walker, and figuring out how to succeed with each takes a bit of time.     There are four mission types in the single-player portion of Battlegrounds. Each objective takes place in a compact arena that echoes the desolate, alien feeling you would expect from Mars. The red ground beneath your tires is a constant reminder that you're not on your home planet, and the primordial foliage sweeping across some stages further cements this image. However, there isn't much time to examine the flora when you're taking part in the high-energy activities. Speed Trial is the most exciting of the included mission types, and it's also the only one in which maneuverability, and not firepower, takes priority. Racing around hostile worlds is exhilarating because the tight controls make cornering a breeze, and the varied terrain is composed of enough ramps and bends to keep you engaged. The small courses hide few secrets, but that doesn't lessen the fun of striving to beat your best time.        Unfortunately, there are only three Speed Trial missions, and the rest of your single-player experience isn't nearly as interesting. Survival and Annihilate events pit you against waves of enemy attackers. The shooting controls are as seamless as racing around a corner, letting you vanquish your foes just by pointing the right stick at what you want to kill. You don't have to worry about elevation or distance either because your gun automatically adjusts to ensure your shot hits true. In the early going, it can be fun to rain down fire on your hapless foes and bathe in their fiery remains, but that pleasure quickly dissipates when you realize just how repetitive the experience is. There's little strategy in how you destroy your attackers, so you need only drift around the arena opening fire when enemies materialize. Survival mode is particularly tiresome. Your goal is simply to live as long as possible, but the lack of depth means you have to rely on luck as much as skill to complete your task. Waiting for the appearance of a crucial health power-up to save you from imminent death is a large part of the strategy, which makes this a dull and aggravating mode.     Shooting Range combines the racing and shooting action that make up the bulk of the game. You cruise around the same arenas as before, only this time, you have to destroy purple land mines that materialize in out-of-reach places. Taking tight turns is as fun here as it is in Speed Trials, though because your vehicle can be damaged by the blast of an exploding mine, you have to use more caution to get around. Striving for high scores is still mildly entertaining, though it lacks the frantic energy that the pure racing mode offers. This sad medley of modes is all you'll find in the perfunctory single-player campaign. You can breeze through all of these missions in less than an hour. Though you can always strive for higher completion scores to earn bonuses such as a speed increase for your tank or a better leaderboard time, this is a skimpy package nonetheless.     Once you've tested your mettle in the single-player offerings, it's time to challenge intelligent foes in competitive play. You can take part in four-player matches either online or offline, and you have a new set of objectives to try your hand at. Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill (along with team variants) are the available modes, though they sadly offer even less entertainment than the forgettable solo endeavors. Deathmatch is too chaotic for its own good. Explosions fill the screen, and it's difficult to tell where you are and who's whittling your health down. Death is frequent and unavoidable, and you never quite know whom to attack or how to stay alive for more than a few agonizing seconds.         The other two modes are more focused than Deathmatch, though no more fun. In Capture the Flag, you need to bring a flag to your opponent's base. It's a simple enough concept made aggravating by the flag bearer's tendency to drop the flag at inopportune moments. When your health goes down to a random level, you inexplicably drop your treasure, and this happens with such frequency that it can make matches stretch on until long after the excitement has worn off. In King of the Hill, you have to stake out a specific portion of the map while your friends try to unseat you. But the hill doesn't move, which means everyone just converges on one spot, shooting their guns and creating death, without much strategy. Your vehicles aren't agile enough to make these battles interesting, so you just mindlessly lob bullets into the center and hope you come out on top.      Battlegrounds had a chance to provide a unque twist to the classic Red Faction action, but this tired dual-stick shooter fails to create an engaging experience. The flimsy connection to the mainline games is hardly enough to lure longtime fans into the fold, and the dull action has little chance of engendering goodwill for anyone who previously ignored this franchise. Shooting enemies and competing in races are fun for a little while, but there's not nearly enough content to justify the $10 price tag. Battlegrounds is a disappointing spin-off that does nothing to build on the Red Faction name.  "
3590,Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,5.0,1,"  Ford Bold Moves Street Racing for the PlayStation Portable is a handheld version of the underwhelming Xbox/PS2/PC game that features plenty of Ford-brand cars and trucks racing around the highways and byways of Los Angeles. Surprisingly, the game looks and plays best on the PSP; unfortunately, that simply isn't enough to redeem this uninspired, vanilla street-racing game.        Fans of Ford-brand cars and trucks will be right at home with the car lineup in Ford Street Racing, which, as you might imagine, features a trailerload of models from the manufacturer with the blue oval logo. There are classic models such as the '62 Thunderbird and '68 Mustang, modern performance cars such as the 2002 Focus RS and Bronco Concept, and high-performance models like the Shelby GR-1 Concept and 2005 Ford GT. As in the console and PC versions of the game, the car models look good, and like the rest of Ford Street Racing's graphics on the PSP, the sharper resolution of the PSP's screen makes both the cars and the tracks look even better.     You'll take these various Ford models through a number of different game modes, the most important of which is career mode. Here, you choose between solo and team events, and you'll have a garage you can use in between races to repair cars you already own, plus a showroom where you can spend your race winnings on new cars. Career mode comprises two main event types, solo and team races, and as you move through both series, you'll unlock new cars and tracks and win cash along the way. Solo events are simple straight-ahead races--you against the world--while the more interesting team races challenge you to control two cars on the track (by shifting back and forth between them) in an effort to score as many team points as possible.     It's the team racing events that are the best part of Ford Street Racing. Though you can control only two cars--down from three in the console and PC versions of the game--the concept works, even if the mechanics sometimes don't. The constant juggling between cars (you jump between them by pressing up on the directional pad) can make for some excitement, as you're always trying to get the best possible finishing position for both cars or trying to pull your teammate out of trouble when he gets in an accident. Two additional gameplay mechanics add some variety as well; at any time you can tell the teammate you aren't currently controlling to either ""block"" or ""draft"" for you by pressing the left or right trigger, respectively. A teammate who blocks will attempt to slow down and impede the progress of any car behind him, giving you time to catch up if you're behind, or to put some distance between you if you're ahead. The draft command will cause your teammate to get in front of you and give you a slipstream boost. Time it right and you can get a dual draft, where you each benefit from a draft boost in quick succession.     While team gameplay is an interesting concept, it doesn't always work in the game, mainly due to some seriously dumb artificial intelligence demonstrated by the drivers in the game. Opponent cars not only have no inkling as to where the other cars are on the road, they probably wouldn't care even if they did. Curiously, the racing model in the PSP version of Street Racing seems to have been tuned a bit, preventing you from opening up the kind of wide-open leads you could get in some events in other versions of the game. A bad side effect of this, however, is that you will often be caught in the middle of a crashing, bashing pack of incredibly aggressive racers, with little if any hope of breaking free. It also doesn't help that your own AI-controlled teammates can't be counted on, as they'll bash into the rear of your car practically every time you call for a draft. Calling for a block can sometimes be useful, especially if you have a good line of sight to your opponent's position, but it really only works when you are side by side with your opponent and can form a double-wide barricade.     With all of the banging and bashing in Ford Street Racing, expect your cars to take some serious damage. Unfortunately, all of the damage seems to be cosmetic; even after subjecting our Shelbys and Mustangs to the severest of race conditions, the cars' performance abilities remained the same, which makes the need for repairing your cars in your garage seem like little more than an artificial excuse to take money away from you. That said, if you don't mind your cars banged up a bit, you certainly don't have to repair them. There's nothing in the way of car upgrades or tuning to worry about, and the only thing you'll have to choose in terms of customization is your team paint scheme before each race event.     While the majority of races in Street Racing are straight-ahead sprints to the finish line, the game has a few other event types as well, including team elimination (where the last two cars in the race are eliminated per lap), overtaking challenges, and time trials, among others--all supported by an arcade physics engine that often doesn't feel realistic, but translates decently to the PSP's analog stick and button combo. Even with the various race types, however, it won't be long before you find yourself going through the motions in the different events--unlike the best arcade racers, there isn't really any overwhelming sense of speed or danger to any of the events here. As a result, expect a rapid onset of boredom before too long. The game's wireless ad hoc multiplayer for up to six players (three in team races) plays well, but the limited race options offer little replay value.        While the car models, tracks, and event types are lifted directly from the console and PC versions of Ford Street Racing, the PSP game has an upgraded menu system that is an improvement over the presentation in the console and PC versions. A basic map shows you the different events available to you in both solo and team modes, and at each event on the map, you can choose from a competition series and two additional challenges. Events are restricted by vehicle class--one race might require two high-performance cars, another will allow only Thunderbird models to compete, and so on.     Thanks to sharper graphics and a better menu system, the presentation in Street Racing is best on the PSP. The sound, on the other hand, is still pretty dull. Car engines showcase some decent variety, but that is in stark contrast to the underwhelming soundtrack and repetitive crash effects. If you're playing this game on a bus or train, don't feel bad if you have to turn down the volume--you really aren't missing that much.      We'll hand it to the folks behind the PSP version of Ford Bold Moves Street Racing: They didn't simply port the console game to Sony's handheld and throw it on store shelves. In fact, we have no qualms in saying that this is the best version of the game you can buy. That said, at $20 more than the console versions, we also have no qualms in saying that, unless you are a diehard Ford fan who simply must have your favorite brand with you everywhere you go, there is no compelling reason to own Street Racing.

4386,R/C Helicopter,4.0,0,"Tired of playing Windows Solitaire? If you want a similarly light and vaguely amusing game with which to while away a few spare minutes, then R/C Helicopter Indoor Flight Simulation might be the game for you. Like 2000's Airfix Dogfighter, R/C Helicopter lets you do what you couldn't get away with as a kid: fly motorized scale aircraft through the house. Created by Japanese developer Aqua System, R/C Helicopter is, in a way, a decent example of how to create a budget game. Very few budget games can compete with the big boys in the prestigious shooter or racing genres, for instance. R/C Helicopter instead sticks to a very simple but unusual concept. Unfortunately, the game is so simple and so dogged by design problems that it's hard to recommend to serious gamers. Casual gamers might find it mildly entertaining for a little while, though.  In R/C Helicopter, you'll control 1:48-scale helicopters such as the McDonnell Douglas MD520N, Italian Augusta A-109 K2, the Japanese Air Force's Kawasaki OH-1, the US military's AH-64 Apache, and others. You'll get to unlock more helicopters as you progress through the game. Each one has noticeably different flight characteristics, so the array of helicopters isn't just for show.    You can control the helicopters with either your keyboard or a joystick. It requires a lot of coordination to manage a helicopter's unusual mode of flying in real life, and the same is true in this game. Unfortunately, you can't alter the low sensitivity of the keyboard controls or the high sensitivity of the joystick controls. Whichever you choose, you're bound for some frustrating flying.    R/C Helicopter offers just two simple modes of play: challenge and adventure. Challenge lets you unlock successively tougher levels with four trials each, and you can complete the trials in any order. The tasks begin with simple maneuvers, like landing on a small raised platform in the middle of a large empty loft. As you progress, you'll need to circle around poles, dodge or destroy balloons, shoot targets with the Apache helicopter, land on moving platforms located perilously close to the ceiling, and so forth. You'll need to beat a fixed score to pass each challenge, with the score based on time taken and the accuracy and smoothness of your landing. These challenges are just barely interesting enough to keep you occupied for a while. They're certainly no great test of your intellect or reflexes. As long as you have a very steady hand and lots of patience, you'll do fine.     But some of these challenges can be frustrating, not just because of the game's poor controls, but also because of the poorly implemented camera system that lags behind the chopper and gets blocked by the scenery. Get ready to rip the rotors off your helicopter more than once as you bash into walls or the ceiling. R/C Helicopter would have made a great children's game because of its simple goals and lack of violence--if only the controls and camera weren't so trying.    Along with the challenge mode, you get adventure mode, in which you fly through a house filled with chairs, bookcases, desks, stereos, and the like. Your goal is to collect stars hidden about the rooms, searching them out in drawers and cabinets or under furniture. You'll literally unlock new rooms as you collect all the stars in a room, with doors now granting access to previously closed sections of the house. Like challenge mode, adventure mode offers very little in the way of sophistication or diversity, and the camera and control problems become even greater hindrances than in the challenge mode because of the many cramped areas you'll need to navigate.  Visually, R/C Helicopter will remind you of early 3D tech demos or student computer art projects: pleasant but nothing memorable or close to cutting edge. You do get some mirrored textures, like polished wood floors, but for the most part, the textures and objects all look fairly simple, if not simplistic. What most hurts the visuals is the monotonously bright and unrealistic lighting. At least the helicopters themselves are fairly well modeled and animated, which helps offset the general blandness of the other graphics.    The game's sound matches the visuals: It's competent enough to get the job done. The sound effects are fairly convincing but extremely basic--you'll mainly hear just the helicopter engines. The soundtrack largely sticks with disposable electronic dance pop.    The lack of audiovisual richness and imagination is indicative of R/C Helicopter as a whole. The game's design is simplicity itself, though that's not necessarily a bad thing as long as you know what you're getting. R/C Helicopter is more an amusement than a true game. It's something to goof around with when you have 10 minutes to kill, but if you want any more than that, you should look elsewhere."
1572,Journey,10.0,2,"This review contains spoilers. For a spoiler-free review of Journey, you can read our original review here.  true, each and every time. ""Journey would be just as effective as a movie,"" a friend once told me, but I must contradict her. Not that I can argue against the game's sumptuous environments and its sublime musical score, which earned masterpiece status the moment Journey was initially released on the PlayStation 3 in 2012. Certain landscapes have rightfully gained iconic stature, becoming the very definition of video game beauty. One shot depicts the cloaked figure you control standing atop a sand drift and gazing at the mountain you must reach, which rises above the desert and pierces the clouds. The view is a master class in simplicity and color story; the peach-orange tones of the sand give way to a sea-green sky--hushed hues for a hushed visual revelation. Another seminal sight: you skate across the sand from right to left, illuminated by a godly beam of sunlight while watching the remnants of a lost culture rush past. The screen is awash with shades of amber, and the warm sand glimmers as if mixed with golden crystals. Yes, even as a work of cinema, Journey would instill wonder. But Journey is not a film, and its power is not gained by pretty pictures alone, but by your presence in its world. That side-scrolling glide would not choke me up if I couldn't feel the sand beneath my feet, and couldn't hit a ramp in just the right way to propel myself into the air. I wouldn't feel so beat down by the wind if I didn't feel it pushing against me as I trudged forward, and I wouldn't be so euphoric if I didn't personally experience the joy of skimming the ground. You see, you hear, and, vitally, you do. You surf the sand, you ride the wind, you seek shelter from danger, you make a friend. Seeing is believing, but it takes interaction to understand and know. Describing Journey means describing these moments and these emotions. The mechanical basics are almost secondary, and quickly explainable. As a mysterious robed figure, you cross sand and other terrain en route to a far-off mountain. You make use of only two buttons. By pressing X, you leap into the air and soar, an ability that is limited by the length of the scarf that trails behind you. By pressing circle, you cry out to whatever or whomever might heed your call. Journey is desolate, but you are not alone. You call to flocks of ribbons that hover about like restless robins, and they provide energy to your scarf. You meet cloth creatures that become travel guides and provide magic-carpet rides to higher ground. And presuming you play while connected to the Internet, you may encounter another lone individual in your travels--an individual you can ignore, or one you can accompany, chirping to her when you locate secret hieroglyphs, or when a fearsome ribbon-dragon appears and you don't want to continue alone. The mechanics are simple, but they establish a direct connection to the heart. Consider that flowing scarf, which trails behind you as you surf and soar, growing larger whenever you locate and touch a glowing flower. On a mundane level, it functions as a power bar that you fill up by making contact with cloth, and deplete by leaping. In context, the scarf is your life force, governing your ability to joyfully drift through the air. Gliding is Journey's most exuberant act, and by limiting its use, the game makes joy itself a currency. Journey uses this ecstasy-based economy to craft an emotional arc across its entirety, as well as to emphasize individual moments. Your scarf grows longer and longer, but a frightful encounter with that terrible ribbon-monster turns your rippling shawl into a mere stub. You cannot fight--you can only hide. Being discovered is devastating because the scarf is where the cheer and comfort of flight are stored. You were offered a heartwarming gift, only to have it yanked from your hands. Journey also uses this moment to connect you with your wordless cooperative companion. By this stage, you understand the meaning the scarf carries with it. Seeing your sidekick succumb like this forges empathy: you know that the monster has abolished his joy. This give-and-take is how the final levels gain their potency. Your ability to glide is diminished, then revoked. You no longer drift through sand, but brace yourself against an exhaustive wind. Then, the moment comes when all hope seems lost. You hold your breath and assume the worst. And then, the controller rumbles--just once, like a single heartbeat. And all that was taken away is restored, then multiplied, and multiplied again. This is the source of those tears. It is not the sadness of the loss, but the bliss of being honored for your perseverance. These are tears of elevation, so perfectly described by Roger Ebert in 2009. I have heard people describe this final climb in terms of an afterlife, and that's a reasonable interpretation of the scene, in which you float higher and higher towards the mountain's zenith. But even in the moment, whether or not you make this conscious religious association, you might feel weepy in spite of yourself. The gift was given, and it was taken away. And then, you were liberally showered with gifts, and so you ascended, higher and higher, towards your next journey. It is possible that Journey will not move you. In such a case, it is simply a beautiful game with a glorious soundtrack, grounded by a wistful cello melody later threaded through a warm quilt of winds and strings. The chance you might be swept away, however, makes it worth plunging your feet into the warm sand. If you are returning to Journey, a higher resolution and a higher frame rate are your ostensible rewards for returning--a return that doesn't cost you anything if you already own the game on the PlayStation 3. But Journey's real rewards aren't so pedestrian. Journey offers you comfort. It gives you companionship in a lovely but forsaken world. It gives you reason to dream even when facing loss."
3072,Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Daggerdale,4.0,0,"      Underneath the visual blemishes lies a thoroughly ordinary hack-and-slash game. You choose from one of four characters: a human warrior, an elven rogue, a dwarven cleric, or a halfling mage. Each character has a melee attack, a ranged attack, a class ability, and a number of special spells or attacks that are called powers. The class abilities range from the mundane (the warrior's block) to the enjoyable (the mage's short-range teleport), and the powers available to each character set them apart from each other a bit. The mage is an offensive character whose spells allow him to do tremendous amounts of damage, for instance, while the warrior's skills do things like slow enemies down and enable him to withstand more punishment. These differences make playing cooperatively with up to four players online more interesting, as the abilities complement each other and let parties slaughter enemies more effectively. But they're not so significant as to have a large impact on your experience when playing solo. Any character can hack, slash, and shoot his or her way through the game in much the same way as any other. Health potions are plentiful enough and cheap enough for you to endure the damage foes deal out whether or not you've got a cleric by your side trying to keep you alive.           These issues might be easy to overlook if Daggerdale's online play for up to four players worked well, but it doesn't. For starters, when choosing a game to join, all you're told is how many players are in each game; you're given no indication of what level the characters are or where they are in the campaign. As a result, you might jump into a game only to find that your character is much higher or lower level than the other players or that the quest in progress is one you've done a dozen times already. (Of course, you can create a game yourself to avoid this issue, but then the players who join you will be doing so blindly.) Once you're deep in the dungeons with other players, minor and major frustrations crop up constantly. Arrows indicating quest objectives may show up for the host but not for other players. If you are doing some shopping or changing your equipment when another player talks to a non-player character, you're instantly whisked out of whatever you're doing and into conversation with that character. You may find that a merchant who has a wide variety of items on offer for other players has nothing for sale for you, or that you're inexplicably unable to assign your powers to buttons so that you can actually use them. When you're able to just focus on killing monsters as a team, cooperative play is fun, but far too many problems interfere with this enjoyment. You can also play local co-op with one other player, which eliminates many of these issues, but requires both players to stick closely together.     It might take most players six hours or so to reach the game's climactic battle and experience its strange cliffhanger. Unfortunately, there are too many issues plaguing Daggerdale to make the implied prospect of more adventures to come an enticing one, and those glaring issues also make the game's $15 price tag tough to swallow. There are far more attractive opportunities out there for would-be wizards and warriors.  "
1131,NBA Playgrounds,6.0,1,"Playgrounds has only one game mode in both single-player and online multiplayer: two-on-two. Aside from an Exhibition mode used for practice, the bulk of your time in Playgrounds is spent competing in tournaments around the world on one of six courts, styled after real-world cities such as New York and Shanghai. You have to play through three-minute games before your team is able to compete in the five-minute championship, which unlocks new courts and player-card packs that grant you a new selection of the game's 150-plus real players from the NBA's 30 teams.Playgrounds is quick and fun--in the short term. A lot of the game's offense and defense comes down to timing. Once you get that down, it adds a fun sense of rhythm to the game--knowing when to release a shot, the best time to try for a steal, or when to attempt an alley-oop. But a lack of AI responsiveness disrupts that rhythm. Computer-controlled teammates won't always react when you direct them to set a pick or initiate an alley-oop, which can lead to the shot clock expiring or an easy steal for your opponent. You eventually learn that you can only consistently rely on your AI teammate to shepherd the ball while you look for open space on the court.Despite the fact that your partner is often unreliable, the moments when the AI behaves according to plan can lead to impressive displays of teamwork. You’re rewarded for flashy play during games by pulling off alley-oops, fancy dunks, and stealing the ball from opponents. These moves fill up your team's special meter, which, when full, pays out a random ""lottery pick."" One such lottery pick guarantees a player's shot will go in from any distance after passing the half-court line, or even if it’s being blocked by the opposing team. Another one awards two extra points for dunks, helping to transform a close game into a four-point lead at the drop of a hat.The hope of getting a lottery pick, as well as the fear of having one used against you, keeps games tense. You may find yourself pumping your fists in excitement one moment, then throwing your controller when an opponent gets a lucky opportunity the next. The give and take of this system's rewards and punishments are immediately apparent and encourage improvement in your overall strategy.There's a definite feeling of accomplishment in the process of getting better at Playgrounds. Finding a break to make a three-pointer, disregarding traditional rules to shove an opponent away from the ball when they're most vulnerable, or capitalizing on a fleeting opportunity for a flashy dunk all feel great, and smart plays are often rewarded with expressive, hype-inducing animations.Despite the fact that each character has his own stats, they rarely feel distinct from each other during a game.Special mention has to be given to Playgrounds' dunks. They're impressively choreographed--your player may do flips, spins, or even knock opponents down in midair, all before nearly ripping the rim from the backboard. Conversely, it’s maddening to watch your opponent do the same when your defensive lapses lead to a creative display of dominance on the court, but in a way that inspires you to consistently do better, rather than to quit.One of Playgrounds' main draws is no doubt its goofy aesthetic, which is a direct homage to NBA Jam. Unlocking new characters is enjoyable in that you're treated to detailed-yet-stylized takes on real-world players. But despite the fact that each character has his own stats, they rarely feel distinct from each other during a game. You can easily get by using the initial roster, and once you settle on a pair of go-to players, subsequent recruits ultimately feel like trophies on a shelf--awarded for playing well, rather than new tools.Variety ends with the game's visuals, though. There isn't much else to do other than playing through a tournament. In Exhibition, you have some added options, like the color of the ball or how long a game lasts, but in tournaments, you play the same four rounds over and over across the game's six levels. Getting stuck on a particularly hard final round can be immensely frustrating, given the lack of an alternative mode or palate cleanser. This monotony is exacerbated by the game's two announcers--Ian Eagle and EJ Johnson--who repeat the same corny jokes each game.Playgrounds' online offering is also plagued by this lack of content, also launching with only one game mode. But playing against an actual person does help alleviate some of the game's repetition. Online games tend to be far goofier and more sporadic, with two players competing not just to win, but to do so in style. Reckless performances in the name of fun gives Playgrounds' multiplayer games a level of slapstick enjoyment not found in single-player."
1983,Life Goes On,8.0,2," Pikmin to Patapon, put you in command of lemming-like characters that are prepared to gasp their last breath for the greater good. Life Goes On, however, pushes the concept of ""taking one for the team"" to new levels, not just encouraging you to accept collateral damage, but requiring you to cause these casualties to complete its challenges. Seconds after you fire up the game, your first knight is impaled on a bed of spikes; his fresh corpse is then immediately used like a makeshift stepping stone for a newly spawned hero. The self-sacrifice is jarring at first, because willfully throwing yourself onto a sharpened stake goes against the self-preservation skills we've been mastering since those pesky Space Invaders first blew up our blocky ship. But suicide soon becomes second nature when you discover that the quickest path to success is paved with many a dead guy and gal. Life Goes On's early puzzles ease you in, maybe tasking you with jumping into a spinning saw blade before lifelessly falling onto a pressure plate that provides safe passage for your next knight. Things get clever quickly though, and you're soon stacking corpses like cordwood to coordinate and manage a variety of elements and factors that keep each level's Holy Grail-like prize out of reach. In addition to the aforementioned obstacles and traps, the little human sacrifices encounter swinging pendulums, seesaws, ramps, conveyor belts, lava lakes, and little monsters that fall into a deep slumber upon popping knights in their maws like peanuts. In addition, morbid fun is delivered via cannons that must be carefully aimed before firing their flesh-and-bone bullets into a grisly death trap. While intentionally mutilating the clueless minions is great fun, solving Life Goes On's devious stages isn't as simple as just unceremoniously impaling, freezing, and incinerating these knights in shining fodder, er, armor. An especially clever touch is the inclusion of checkpoint-like spawn points; once reached, these glowing blue orbs become your next place to manufacture new knights. Things get tricky, however, when puzzles force you to reactivate previously used spawn points, or conversely, to avoid them altogether for fear of triggering them. Thankfully, Life Goes On gives you full control over your character, so you're never trying to corral an auto-walking avatar like in similar games. On top of crushing the long-established convention that checkpoints equal permanent progress, the game tracks your time and the number of knights killed after each stage. Mercifully, Life Goes On doesn't put a limit on either, but both provide a nice bar for high-score chasers and achievement hunters to measure themselves against. A handful of levels are more frustrating than fun, and a few puzzle elements are recycled more than you'd want, but Life Goes On mostly keeps the challenge balanced and the progress well paced. New brain-benders--and fresh ways to solve them--are introduced frequently, but on a gradual learning curve, while the controls, which require just two simple inputs, are super responsive; even performing precision jumps, the bane of many a platformer, is effortless. Things get tricky, however, when puzzles force you to reactivate previously used spawn points or task you with avoiding them altogether for fear of triggering them. The game's greatest asset, though, is its sadistic sense of humor. Sporting a pretty presentation--complete with slick lighting, shadowing, and particle trickery--and packed with personality, the macabre concept comes off more charming than disturbing. Each knight has a name--such as the Cautious Maiden Pauline Cromwell--which is unceremoniously crossed off a scroll when he or she dies. And each carries a sword despite, apparently, having no idea what to do with it. Other whimsical touches include the single surviving knight pushing all his dead brothers and sisters in a wagon after each stage, as well as messages like ""Pattern Recognition Precludes Victory"" and ""Messiest Victory Since Lemmings"" accompanying your end-stage stats. If you're violently allergic to puzzle games, Life Goes On won't miraculously cure you. But as long as you're open to the idea of having your mind engaged more than your trigger finger, this melon-twister's wicked personality alone might be enough to pull you into its death grip."
215,Trek to Yomi,5.0,1,"The one thing that immediately stands out about Trek to Yomi is its striking visual style. Set during Japan's Edo Period, Trek to Yomi captures feudal Japan with a grainy black and white filter reminiscent of classic samurai cinema--particularly the movies of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Almost every single frame in Trek to Yomi could be a painting; such is the beauty of its immaculate composition. For all of its gravitas, however, the side-scrolling action game underneath it all continually underwhelms. When two heavy, steel katanas clash against each other with a subdued and weightless whimper, it becomes clear that Trek to Yomi lacks the substance to match its fantastic style.Most of your time in Trek to Yomi is spent cutting down enemies with protagonist Hiroki's deadly katana. Combat adopts a familiar structure as you utilize light and heavy attacks, parries, dodge-rolls, and ammo-limited ranged weapons like a bow and shurikens to carve through each enemy encounter. Stamina governs how often you can block and attack before becoming winded and leaving yourself open to attack, but both health and stamina can be upgraded by exploring and finding pickups off the beaten path. You'll also unlock new combos as you progress, including one that lets you swing backwards--useful for dealing with enemies who emerge from behind--and another that leads with a heavy attack before transitioning into a combination of lightning-fast strikes.You feel appropriately deadly, able to cut through most enemies with a couple of sword swings, but this does mean combat is a cakewalk for the most part. Armored enemies aren't quite as easy to kill, since they're able to sustain more damage and generally have more elaborate combos, and enemy types like those wielding spears force you to close the distance before you can strike a killing blow. The problem with Trek to Yomi's combat is that dispatching these foes rarely ever feels satisfying. There's a lack of fluidity when transitioning between different actions, and the animations are stuttery and stilted, lending everything a sense of weightlessness that's at odds with the game's cinematography. Parries are decidedly underwhelming, too, and enemies tend to attack one at a time--even when they have you surrounded--eliminating much need in even using the mechanic. It all results in combat taking on a formulaic rhythm as you simply parry, attack, and then repeat, regardless of which enemy type you're confronted with.There's little of substance outside of combat as well. Seeking alternate paths can lead to the discovery of fun environmental hazards that let you bypass entire combat sequences altogether--cutting a rope to send logs tumbling onto some hapless bandits sitting around a campfire, for instance, or opening up a dam to wipe out a group with rushing water. There's also a single rudimentary puzzle, where you have to look at three kanji characters in the environment and then line them up correctly, that's reused multiple times. There's a degree of challenge in having to differentiate between various symbols, but this creates a dissonance in your role as Hiroki considering, as someone who's Japanese, he would presumably read kanji and not be confused by these puzzles.Ultimately, the visuals do a lot of the heavy lifting; Trek to Yomi's cinematic presentation is eye-catching right from the very beginning. The game opens with Hiroki, a young samurai-in-training, practicing with his sword alongside his master. This sequence serves as a combat tutorial that blends in nicely with Hiroki's origin and seamlessly shifts into the motivating force of the story.Things suddenly go awry when your master is summoned to protect the village from an invading force of bandits, so he charges off, spear in hand, and tells you to stay put. That obviously doesn't happen, as Hiroki quickly leaves the dojo in search of his master, and it's here that Trek to Yomi's arresting visual style reveals itself in both subtle and spectacular ways.After descending the steps leading into town, the camera positions itself behind shopkeepers and busy market stalls as you weave between silhouettes. You're given a full range of 3D movement when exploring the environment, but the camera is fixed in order to frame each scene as though it were a movie. The lens sits in tight as you move through the village and pass its many denizens, before panning out once Hiroki emerges through the main gate, letting you soak in the vast rice fields and mountains rising in the distance--fluidly transitioning from the intimacy of the village to the grand scale of the outside world. As you confront the violent bandits bearing down on your home, Trek to Yomi moves to a 2D plane to present its side-scrolling combat. It's an effective perspective switch that results in numerous instances where you face off with lone warriors against scenic backdrops, further latching on to that cinematic feeling.Kurosawa's inspiration isn't just confined to a shallow black and white filter either. There might not be anything here that can truly match the Japanese director's brilliance, but that doesn't prevent Trek to Yomi from being an excellent homage. Its use of natural phenomena, like wind, rain, fire, and mist, creates movement that breathes life into each frame in a very Kurosawa-esque fashion. Occasionally, the camera will even move through a scene as though the director himself was behind the lens, effortlessly flowing from a wide-angle shot to a close-up and then back again in one fluid motion. Because it was built from the ground up as a black and white game, Trek to Yomi's image really pops as well. There's a clear understanding of contrast, shadows, and the clash between light and dark tones that prevent each frame from looking as flat as they would if a basic filter was simply applied.While Kurosawa's samurai films are often slow-paced and methodical, Trek to Yomi is anything but, which is one of the many areas in which its story and characters veer away from the stylings of the influential filmmaker. Hiroki's master is eventually slain by the roving bandits attacking his village, so the young samurai makes a vow to protect his home and those he loves against any future threats. Later on, once Hiroki has grown into a hardened samurai, the village once again erupts in violence, sending Hiroki on a tale of revenge as he confronts his own guilt at failing to uphold the vow he made to his dying master.It's a simple story that moves along at a fairly brisk pace, often squeezing in less than a minute of dialogue before you're onto the next fight. The emotional beats don't quite pay off since you don't spend enough time with any of the characters to become invested, but it never tries to stretch itself too thin. This is a refined tale that complements the action without ever being truly compelling. At times, it's disappointing that it doesn't do more--only briefly touching on Shinto mythology, for example--but it serves its purpose, generating momentum with its revenge-fueled romp.The faults of its gameplay are especially disappointing given that Trek to Yomi is such a gorgeous and spellbinding game to look at. Its visuals are evocative of classic samurai cinema in a way few other games have managed, successfully capturing the look and feel of Kurosawa's masterpieces with aplomb. It's easy to recommend if you have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, if only to marvel at each meticulously constructed frame. If only the game beneath it all wasn't such an unfortunate letdown."
1784,Escape Dead Island,5.0,1,"Extermination and Cold Fear, games with Resident Evil-branded chips on their shoulders. You might be initially curious to know what answers Escape Dead Island, as an expository side story to the original Dead Island, could offer that would shed light on the series' initial outbreak. But Dead Island's mysteries are likely not what compels you to keep up with the franchise. To reinforce the perception of Escape Dead Island’s story as a canonical spin-off, this action adventure game is viewed from the third person rather than the first person perspective used in the prior installments. Moreover, the art direction foregoes the detail and grit of the prior games in favor of a graphic-novel-in-action look, right down to the 1960s Batman-inspired onomatopoeias during combat. The motion-comic style of the cutscenes between chapters are one of the game's few strengths, which made me wonder if this tale would have been presented better as a full graphic novel, digital or otherwise. This art style certainly doesn't do survivor and zombie slayer Cliff Calo any favors. His unkempt beard, permanently furrowed brow, and Ian Somerhalder eyes make him the leading contender for the cockiest-looking protagonist of 2014. After a few hours, he reveals himself to be a more likable hero, who spits off chuckle-inducing one-liners that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger blush. The “best” include, ""How you like them brains?"", ""Mind under matter,"" ""Get some sleep. You look dead tired,"" and ""Let me axe you a question."" Propelled by the need to impress his dad, Cliff and his two journalist friends have taken to the seas--thanks to the boat Cliff stole from his dad--to investigate the rumors surrounding Banoi, the locale of the first Dead Island. Instead, they end up at Napapela, which is in the same archipelago, and is conveniently affected by the same outbreak as Banoi. Cliff's motivations do more than hint at daddy issues, which reach hamfisted levels with physical manifestations of emotional baggage by the second half of the story. Coupled with a series of dream sequences inspired by Groundhog Day, you're left wondering what is a hallucination and what is reality. When some of the chapters begin with him waking up from the same bed inside a shipping container, you wonder if any of this is real at all. These tricks of perception are further explored in the new-game-plus playthrough, where subtle changes to map progression and narrative pique your curiosity. It’s enough to draw you in for another few hours, but not enough to warrant a second full playthrough. Escape Dead Island's uninspired design extends to its inventory system. It's neither as deep as the expandable suitcases of Resident Evil 4 nor as sparse as I Am Alive. There's no submenu for items; weapons like the pistol or katana are simply accessible with a single button press. Gear-like ropes and grapple hooks function more like keys than inventory items, since they're only useful in very specific areas. Even the gas mask auto-equips if you step foot in a toxic area. And it wouldn't be a zombie game without a makeshift melee weapon. Cliff's best creation is a multi-bladed hatchet on a pole, which he makes without your help. The lack of crafting further underscores the shallowness of Escape Dead Island. One of the genre's conundrums is not knowing how many items should be saved in anticipation of a major fight. If you play conservatively, you end up vanquishing the final boss in less than 10 seconds due to having more rocket launcher rounds and other explosives than they know what to do with. Escape Dead Island saves you the time and effort of pondering item conservation because it doesn't have items for you to hoard aside from ammo. Furthermore, you only have two guns, a pistol and a shotgun. Gear-like ropes and grapple hooks function more like keys than inventory items, since they're only useful in very specific areas. Overall, the mix of optional zombie encounters versus mandatory ones is an even split. The sensation of pulling off a quiet, effective, and gruesome kill captures the same satisfaction as a discrete takedown in other stealth-intensive games like The Last of Us and the Splinter Cell series. Even if you prefer confronting over fleeing from zombies, be prepared for the latter. It's not because some sections are particularly hard or overwhelming; there's just no practical incentive to thoroughly cleanse Napapela of the undead. These zombies drop no loot to redeem or spend in stores because no such economies exist, and you can't earn experience since there's no ability-based progression to worry about. It doesn't make Escape Dead Island wholly boring, just one-dimensional. Escape Dead Island also suffers from poorly-placed checkpoints, the kind that force you to endure a real-time cutscene or conversation before you're allowed to jump back into the action. Even worse, any death and subsequent respawn might result in the game freezing. This occurred an average of once per chapter (out of 11 chapters) during my PlayStation 3 playthrough, while I encountered slightly fewer lock-ups on a PC. Napapela is as deep as it is wide, and while the square shape of the map implies a wealth of exploratory possibilities, this island is the furthest thing from an open world. With rooms filled with toxic fumes and locked doors that only upgraded weapons can unlock, traveling through the island is a deceptively linear experience. You have little choice but to move toward your current waypoint and there is little to no motivation to deviate from your course. Aside from a lengthy chapter in which you're tasked with retrieving three access cards from the other side of the island, all other key cards are close to the locked door you're looking to open. There's no guesswork; even the zombies who have the key cards you're looking for are clearly highlighted. I was pleased that the waypoint indicators are easy to follow and continually update as you reach each respective point. In a game in which every hurried footstep counts in avoiding zombies, the optional convenience of these indicators (you need to hold down a button to see your waypoint) did not diminish my experience. Escape Dead Island's few saving graces are the shortcuts that become available later in the game. Much like opening a one-way door in Dark Souls, using newly acquired grappling hooks and other gear turns a 15-minute trek into a five minute stroll. You can tell this was inspired by the best Metroid and Castlevania games, but the application of these influences feels lazy and trite. The only reason you might want to go off the beaten path would be to hunt for collectables, and even those items offer scant insight on the cause of the infection. In the interest of a thorough investigation, Cliff's colleague in crime, Linda, asks him to take photos of newsworthy locales and objects, but since obtaining a complete collection of photos doesn't yield anything worthwhile, this side mission carries little value. As an origin tale, Escape Dead Island is hampered by an issue common to the zombie genre: the appeal of the narrative focusing on the characters' day-to-day survival, combined with little attention being given to finding a remedy to stop the outbreak. When I finished Dead Island three years ago, I wasn't compelled to scour forums to theorize the root causes of the infection. There was enough exposition by game's end and whatever mysteries were left unsolved left me feeling indifferent. Despite my profound apathy regarding making sense of Cliff's hallucinations and dreams, there was at least some satisfaction in silently assassinating the undead."
3192,Dragon Quest VI,8.0,2,"     Dragon Quest V's, with job classes and greater skill variety enriching the experience. The random, turn-based battles present character information on the top screen to reduce clutter, while enemies and colorful battlefields are relegated to the bottom. Full tactical controls let you issue commands individually or across the board, which speeds up battles while the AI focuses on healing or aggressive skills. The job system introduced in Dragon Quest III finally returns, featuring 18 jobs--including two unlockables--and a bevy of skills to unleash. Multiple hybrid jobs keep combat enticing by blending skill sets, so you can craft a stalwart warrior wielding recovery magic or an advanced mage that uses both healing and offensive spells. Characters retain their unlocked skills even as they change jobs, which motivates you to master multiple jobs to create the ultimate personalized team.       Good enemy selection and wide attack variety keep combat lively. Enemy types vary by region and terrain, prompting you to adjust your strategy as you travel from one continent to the next. Updated attack animations increase excitement by achieving a striking 3D effect, which is enhanced by camera movements whenever enemies lurch forward. Foes challenge you by wielding the same powerful spells you have, including sizzling fireballs and swirling icicles that attack the entire party. Monsters also resurrect allies in the midst of combat and often interrupt your battle tactics by casting sleep spells or tricking you into a disco fever.     There are only a few minor design issues in Dragon Quest VI. Talkative priests still force you to swim through pages of dialogue to save your game, while the franchise's addictive monster-taming system has been toned down, leaving you with only a giant lizard and a handful of slimes to recruit. The game's most disappointing element is its multicard wireless feature, which lets you exchange player data with friends for a crummy reward. Its lack of Wi-Fi support also stings, making it unlikely that you'll use the feature at all.     The attractive dual-screen presentation really catches the eye, highlighting the game's 3D environments with vibrant colors. Soft light filters down upon charming towns and bustling castles, while birds soar overhead through swirling clouds. Maneuvering the camera lets you appreciate a town's detailed architecture from every angle, and colorful sprites clutter the streets. A powerful orchestral soundtrack sets a nostalgic tone for series fans, which provides cheerful town music and boisterous battle tunes that intensify key moments. Sound effects receive the same attention to detail, increasing immersion with clear sword swipes and the crack of ferocious spells.       Optional content keeps this lengthy adventure exciting. You might spend 50 hours completing the main quest line alone, and exploring the game's two vast worlds really boosts that amount of time. Mini-medals return, which item collectors can trade for fantastic gear. Enthusiastic explorers will enjoy scouring the ocean bottom for hidden treasure, while battle veterans may delve into an intense bonus dungeon to face a secret foe. Fun minigames also abound, including a fashion show and an adorable slime coliseum, where the lively blobs battle for prizes. You can find high-stakes casinos and a curling minigame with multiple stages as well. Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation feels much like its predecessors, but that's because it focuses on what the series does best: blending absorbing gameplay with an ambitious plot. Though it might not revolutionize the franchise, this massive adventure is well worth its 16-year wait.  "
4107,Tornado,4.0,0,"  Tornadoes are normally associated with destruction--destroying homes, launching cows into the air, and appearing as a cathartic disaster option in SimCity games. In Ignition Entertainment's Tornado for the Nintendo DS, though, you use the titular weather phenomenon to restore Earth to order. With a design much like Katamari Damacy, the game sounds like it would be strangely addictive, but because of a few major slipups, Tornado ends up being frustrating and potentially disastrous.     In Tornado, a character known only as The Prince has sucked up Earth's countries into his own realm for safekeeping, and it's your job--as one of several anthropomorphic felines known as Cosmic Cleaners--to put them all back in place. The cleaners can spin themselves into large tornadoes that transport any item they come in contact with. Each successful transport causes your tornado to grow in size, giving you the ability to transport even larger objects. There are special items strewn about each level that will help you gather up more objects--such as the power-up that temporarily sends three tornadoes in different directions to do your bidding--if you meet certain conditions and apply the correct touch-screen technique.        The most noticeable issue rears its head almost the instant you begin playing your first level. The camera--which gives you an isometric perspective of the polygonal playing field--is, in many instances, too close to everything. Even as your tornado grows and the camera pans out, you can never see as much as you'd want to. Learning where landmarks are on a given level then becomes more of a chore than it should be, and this is especially irritating when you're presented with goals such as ""find five batteries before the time limit is up.""     The pairing of goals with a time limit is another significant issue. Throughout the course of the Story mode, you must find fellow Cosmic Cleaners to use during gameplay. Yet they're sometimes hidden in random structures throughout the level, and there's no indication where you should start looking. By themselves, these goals aren't entirely offensive, but trying to find a randomly hidden character within five minutes--not to mention having to spend time to enlarge your tornado to an effective size--can be infuriating. The game is just unnecessarily difficult, and it wouldn't be exaggerating to say that you might retry some levels 20 times just to pass them.     Even if you come to grips with the goal structure, there's still your aching stylus hand to deal with. Your tornadoes can grow in size only if you energize them by drawing on the touch screen in a circular motion. As you transport items, a five-level meter begins to materialize. The stylus antics serve to fill those meters with energy, and with each full level, your tornado grows a set amount. The rub is that as the tornado touches the object it's trying to transport, it loses energy. So, you're constantly scribbling on the screen as you frantically try to pick up everything in sight before time runs out.      As you complete each of the 10 stages in Tornado, they become available in the Arcade and Versus modes. Part of the allure of games like this is that you're encouraged to pick up the controller and accumulate to your heart's content, and the secondary modes in Tornado get this partially right where the main Story mode doesn't. The close camera, scribbling, and time limit are still present, but at least they're not tied to mandatory goals, so you're free to see how much of each level you can clean up in a relatively stress-free atmosphere. You also get a log of all the crazy items you've transported, and the game keeps track of how much of a level you've cleaned up (in percentage points), so there's incentive to go grab that one extra percent.        Tornado's presentation is somewhat entertaining. Its blocky humanoid characters, random objects, and goofy sound effects are stylistically reminiscent of the Katamari series. Even when you're trying to complete the game's frustrating sixth level (the United States), transporting bluntly named Bikini Women and hearing their comical yelps will make you crack a slight smile.     Tornado has its heart in the right place. The cumulative gameplay design is easy to understand and get into, and at its core, the act of swallowing things up into a controllable tornado is good, silly fun. All it takes are a few significant problems to bring down a fun experience, though, and sadly, Tornado has just enough of them.  "
1109,The Fidelio Incident,6.0,1,"In part, The Fidelio Incident is a loose, modern interpretation of the Beethoven opera referenced in its title: a heroic tale of a faithful wife disguising herself as a man to rescue her falsely imprisoned husband. It's certainly a narrative we don't see terribly often in games, but alas, the only strong ties back to the opera here are the names of our main characters--Leonore and Stanley (Florestan in the opera)--and one particular bit of backstory found halfway through the game.But there's an even more unique narrative about the Northern Ireland Conflict afoot, using Stanley and Leonore's burgeoning relationship in the mid-1980s as an access point to explore what 30 years of ugly, small-scale warfare can do to a country and its populace. This aspect at least gets a bit more room to breathe in The Fidelio Incident, delivered as part of Leonore's scattered diary and Stanley's own hallucinatory flashbacks, but this, too, ends up a secondary concern.Ultimately, all of this is really the window dressing for a graphically impressive but mechanically undercooked journey where Stanley seeks to rescue Leonore after their prop plane crashes and burns in a freezing, desolate area of Iceland. Leonore ends up trapped under the smoldering ruins on a mountaintop. Meanwhile, Stanley is stranded at the mountain's base and has to take the long way up, braving deadly sub-zero temperatures and looking for life-saving heat sources.This ends up being the crux of the game: Stanley moving up the mountain, on foot, while trying to stay warm. It’s a ""struggle"" that turns out to be conveniently easy; the plane crash has strewn fiery debris across the entire area, steam geysers are rampant, and a seemingly abandoned scientific research facility still has enough working mechanisms to let Stanley turn up the heat with the twist of a valve.The turning of valves ends up being the core gameplay mechanic, supporting the rudimentary puzzles that dominate The Fidelio Incident's brief playtime. For example, turning a newfound valve will create a new heat source, which will lead you to the next checkpoint. Lacking in real challenge, the valve-based puzzles are an unimaginative substitute for any number of other survival tactics that could’ve been employed--although, ironically, every attempt made to momentarily shake things up also falls flat. One of the game's scant attempts to introduce variety to the formula is a puzzle involving a hailstorm that's unrealistically localized to a small area of the mountain, an odd choice that forcefully breaks your immersion in the otherwise natural and believable setting.The fact that much of the game's story is delivered via diary pages--pages that so conveniently happened to fall unscathed next to scattered pieces of burning debris--feels similarly contrived, but the tale told within those diary pages tends to be when the game springs to life. Leonore's rapturous Irish lilt tells a tale of young love and attraction that, thanks to political and familial strife and one major, playable shocker of a criminal act, turns elegiac and regretful leading up to the present day. The Stanley and Leonore stranded on the mountain are middle-aged adults at the stage of their relationship where they're together because they don't know how to be with anyone else.Their identities are further reinforced by strong vocal performances from Glenn Keogh and Bess Harrison. Stanley states the obvious with the fierce, all-encompassing realization of what he stands to lose if he can't locate his wife. And Leonore, hot-blooded and larger than life in the pages of the diary, is now tiny and frightened coming over Stanley's radio. The activities you engage in may be lacking, but the motivation to get through them is strong thanks to the sheer force of emotion.Still, The Fidelio Incident being nice to look at and listen to doesn't necessarily make it interesting to play. The haunting, frozen vistas and enthralling backstory constantly trip over uninspired gameplay. Though there’s a measure of forgiveness to be had considering the length of the experience, even that concession is fragile in light of the obvious disparity that exists in the quality of the narrative and the gameplay that's forced upon it."
2283,R.I.P.D. The Game,2.0,0,"  R.I.P.D., much like the movie of the same name, is about the afterlife, and thus it's appropriate that playing it is like suffering through a little version of hell. That's not so much because the world around us turns out to be packed with criminals playing hooky from facing their divine retribution (though there is that), but rather because it's so tedious and unsatisfying to bring them to justice. With its humdrum gameplay and severely flawed mechanics, R.I.P.D. is a mess of cooperative shooter.     Men in Black and Ghostbusters, so it's perhaps only fitting that the game tie-in is an uninspired knockoff of developer Old School Games' own God Mode that debuted earlier this year. Much like God Mode, R.I.P.D.--that's Rest in Peace Department, by the way--doesn't waste any time on a story aside from a brief montage of illustrated stills at the beginning, making gunning down the hordes of bad guys you face feel entirely pointless.     That's partly because there's no campaign to speak of. At its core, R.I.P.D. is little more than a third-person cooperative shooter that has you fighting through seven horde mode maps and a final boss encounter with either of the film's two main characters. On the one hand, you have Jeff Bridges' Roy Pulsipher, an Old West lawman who's still stuck shooting baddies more than a century after his death; on the other, there's Reynolds' Nick Walker, whose model spends the entirety of R.I.P.D. looking as though he accidentally kicked a puppy.      Beyond Pulsipher's Stetson and Walker's perpetual wince, though, there's little to nothing else to give them personalities of their own. Pulsipher may have been in his prime in the days of Hickok and Earp, but he can handle a submachine gun just as well as Walker, and you can buy additional weapons like harpoons and bananas (not a typo) when you collect the bounty from completing a level. Provided, that is, you can even earn a bounty. Securing a bounty involves enduring all five rounds of each map, and you'll likely end up going it alone by making a custom map thanks to the ghost town servers on Steam. Even if you manage to find a working Quick Match, it's common for the hosts to jump ship long before the match ends.       Players' willingness to ditch a game in mid-match might have something to do with the dimwitted AI, which knows no other offensive tactic besides swarming you like paparazzi every time you turn a corner. The game is not even that pleasant to look at; with an arsenal of toilet plungers and discarded car doors complementing their tattered shirts and jeans, you could be forgiven for thinking Pulsipher and Walker had declared war on a community of squatters. At least there's some variety to spice things up in the form of healing deados, sniper deados, and the occasional giant, but that cast of a mere 12 or so thugs doesn't even come close to matching the variety in the superior but similarly flawed God Mode.      It doesn't help that they're a dull bunch, complete with pathfinding so terrible that these former thieves and murderers frequently get stuck on little obstacles like turnstile bars. Special abilities such as turrets and decoys allow you to overcome enemies when the swarm gets too intense, but it's not even fun to kill them in the first place. Hits barely register, and the aiming assist is all but required whether you're playing with a keyboard or a gamepad. Even then, the aiming reticle has an odd tendency not to center on targets but rather focus on a spot slightly to their side. Once you've endured enough of this, each stage culminates in the arrest of some nameless criminal, which involves standing around the defeated enemy much as if you were capturing a point. Don't have the patience for that? Just shoot him in the head for a smaller reward.     Is there any fun at all in R.I.P.D.? Only in the sense that misery loves company. If you and a friend were so unlucky as to pick up R.I.P.D. together, there's some generic shooter fun in clearing the levels as well as in performing simple acts of teamwork, like hitting one of the car-door-wielding deados from behind while your buddy distracts it. Elsewhere, random challenges, such as capturing two points within three minutes or picking up gold trinkets, at least give you something to strive for, as does a betting system that lets you predict how you'll score on goals like headshots and enemies killed.     Pacific Rim earlier this month, R.I.P.D. serves to remind us why movie tie-ins get such a bad rap. Perhaps with more time and resources, Old School Games might have been able to turn R.I.P.D. into something that could have outlasted the film's theatrical run. But this effort is dead on arrival. It must be a feat to make a game so soulless when the entire concept centers on hunting down wayward souls, but R.I.P.D. somehow manages to pull it off. Rest in peace indeed.    "
366,Marvel's Avengers,7.0,2,"Editor's note: In March 2021, Publisher Square Enix released PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X ports of Marvel's Avengers. Like many “next-gen” ports, the new versions offer technical enhancements, including improved graphics and a higher frame rate. The PS5 version also features DualSense-enabled haptic feedback. Alongside those improvements, there's a new character--Clint Barton, the original Hawkeye--and a new set of story missions to match. Here are our impressions on Avengers' technical enhancements and latest content, written by Mike Epstein. Please continue after the break for our original review of Marvel's Avengers by Phil Hornshaw, first published in September 2020. Like so many games of the last few years, Marvel's Avengers gets a quick and easy technical bump when optimized for the current gen. On PS5, you get two choices: higher performance, at 60 frames per second with a dynamically upscaled 4K resolution, or to lock in 4K resolution and play at 30 frames per second. The larger, more tangible improvement comes from picking up the frame rate. Like other boosted ports, the smoother animation at 60fps makes the game better to watch and to play. Combos flow together more smoothly as you pummel robots into shiny, little pieces. And, while I could see some slight differences when I realy scrutinized both versions, you aren't losing any significant detail in performance mode.Either way, the technical upgrade just makes the game run better. Cutscenes that struggle and stutter on PS4 run smoothly on PS5. Some of the game's previously long load times have been cut to virtually nothing. A few spots, like the pre-mission character select screen, still take a little time to work through, but the time to get in and out of missions has improved substantially.On PlayStation 5 specifically, you also get a healthy helping of contextually creative DualSense haptics. Playing as Clint, you get a small amount of resistance in the triggers as you draw and fire his bow. It doesn't quite recreate that feeling of pulling a bowstring taut, but it serves as an okay tactile reference. The DualSense also amplifies the many controller rumblings sprinkled throughout the game, like when you highlight an option on the main menu or start sprinting. It's overused, but easy to ignore.None of these things drastically alter the repetitive brawling experience of Marvel's Avengers. The same can be said of Future Imperfect, the new set of Hawkeye-focused missions. The missions, which took me just over an hour to complete solo, aren't especially inventive. You get a couple of classic post-apocalyptic looks for a couple of characters, which is neat, but it isn't going to change your mind on the game or bring a lapsed player back into the fold long-term. All in all, Marvel's Avengers remains a game that shows flashes of greatness, but has yet to reach its heroic potential. - Mike Epstein, March 19, 2021. The original review, first published in September 2020, continues below. Like the Hulk's mild-mannered counterpart, Bruce Banner, the single-player story campaign of Marvel's Avengers makes a strong first impression with its more thoughtful approach. It's set in its own alternate Marvel Comics universe where the superheroes that make up the Avengers--Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Thor--are famous and beloved. You start the game as Kamala Khan, a young girl who's a huge fan of the heroes, when she attends an Avengers celebration called A-Day in San Francisco. Soon, Kamala will become a superhero in her own right, following a terrorist attack and a tragedy that causes the Avengers to disband and spreads superpowers throughout a segment of the population. And while you'll spend time as each of the titular team, the single-player portion of Marvel's Avengers is really Kamala's story, and it works because she provides it a moral and emotional heart.But this is a superhero game, and that means there are supervillains--and they need punching. The core of Marvel's Avengers is an action-RPG brawler, with you playing a range of characters that deliver beat-downs to Marvel creeps such as Abomination, Taskmaster, and MODOK, as well as their many robotic and human minions. You're treated to a host of moves, which include light and heavy melee strikes, ranged attacks, hero-specific special abilities that have cooldown timers, and extra abilities triggered by using Intrinsic Energy, a resource that generally builds up over time and allows you to activate boosts for damage or defense. Combat in Marvel's Avengers is about stringing together combos and abilities based on the enemies you're facing, with various threats demanding that you kick them into the air to juggle them, break their shields with heavy attacks, or dodge and parry their incoming blows to defeat them.The fighting feels akin to Marvel's Spider-Man or the Batman: Arkham games, although the fighting in Marvel's Avengers adds spins of its own. The longer you play and the more moves you unlock by leveling up a hero, the more options you get in a fight. Avengers has a large and varied roster of enemies, and the further you get into the game, the more often you're made to consider how best to use your combos and superpowers to take down baddies, instead of relying on random button-mashing.You start as Kamala on her journey to become Ms. Marvel, while she works to find and reunite the Avengers. The heroes are needed to take on the threat of AIM--a technology company that produces killer robots and seeks to imprison and ""cure"" anyone who displays superhuman abilities. Before long, you're playing as each of the characters in turn as the story explores the Avengers' emotional turmoil from their failure on A-Day and the five years that have passed since.The strength of Marvel's Avengers is that while every character is stamped out of the same template--melee attacks, a ranged option, special abilities, and Intrinsic Energy--they all play very differently from one another. Iron Man is more of a ranged sniper than a melee brawler, for instance, and is easily laid low if the fighting gets too hot around him. Hulk, meanwhile, gains his Intrinsic Energy from dealing and receiving damage, so you're incentivized to wade straight into combat and smash as much as possible. Kamala gets a damage boost from using her Intrinsic Energy and unlocks additional moves that excel at knocking back and controlling groups of enemies, while Black Widow is a juggler who focuses on dishing out damage and is best at moving quickly around the battlefield to put down specific threats.The Avengers are all different enough from one another that playing each of them can feel like hopping into a separate game, and it's this variety that helps keep Marvel's Avengers interesting--especially as you get into its multiplayer-focused live game portion. In the campaign, all those characters allow you to explore different thematic levels that play to each of the Avengers' strengths, but it also causes the story to feel more disjointed. There's enough difference in the characters that jumping from Kamala to Hulk to Iron Man over the course of a few levels is less empowering than it is disorienting. There's a lot to know about each character, and handling each effectively takes practice and effort. Though the game dishes out character-specific tutorials, they pop up late and are optional. There's not really an elegant way for the game to onboard you with each of the characters, so the single-player campaign starts to feel like more of an extended tutorial to get you ready for the live game.However, the story is an engaging one, with Marvel's Avengers digging into the character-specific conflicts that added depth to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's take on the Avengers. It largely focuses on the relationship between the exuberant Kamala and the reluctant Banner, who's fallen into depression and despair in the years after A-Day. In Banner, Kamala finds a superhero mentor who helps her come to grips with who she is becoming thanks to her new powers, while Kamala helps give Banner the strength to step off the sidelines when he has the ability to change the world. The relationship between Kamala and Banner, and its twisted reflection in villains George Tarleton and Monica Rappaccini, is what makes the campaign of Marvel's Avengers work, and the time spent developing its characters makes them worth investing in.Not everybody in the story gets an equal amount of attention, though. Iron Man's conflict with Banner and how it affects Kamala are key elements, but Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America (who is killed during the events of A-Day) are largely ignored. In practice, the 10- to 14-hour campaign feels like it shortchanges some of the heroes to make room to cram in the Hulk side of Marvel's Avengers: the expansive, multiplayer-focused live game.While many of the missions you play in the single-player campaign are focused on a single hero or maybe a pair of them, by about the halfway point, they start to get combined with forays into the multiplayer offerings of Marvel's Avengers. These are missions of various sizes that you usually take on with a team of four superheroes, either controlled by other players or filled in with AI-controlled versions of the Avengers you've been ranking up and customizing throughout the game. Some of these missions are single encounters in locales like AIM facilities, where you do the sorts of activities you see in other live games--fighting off waves of enemies, defending a specific spot for a set amount of time, destroying a bunch of objects such as power generators, and taking down boss characters. In the bigger, more expansive levels, missions often have multiple steps as well as optional side objectives, such as solving simple puzzles to unlock doors or locating and killing a tough enemy.Playing with other humans especially, it's possible to find synergies between the characters' capabilities and their strengths and weaknesses. Iron Man and Black Widow are great at tangling up a tough enemy while Ms. Marvel and Hulk clear the crowds that fill in around them, for instance. Working together in a fight makes for some cool moments, and even with a team of AI characters, the bigger, tougher battles of Marvel's Avengers get pretty exciting as you smartly deploy your superpowers or get assistance from one of the other heroes.The trouble is, couched within the story campaign, these missions stand out as being a lot less focused. All the levels, even the biggest ones, are pretty homogeneous since they need to support all different characters equally. That turns them into little more than big fighting arenas that don't play to any particular strengths. They also do a lot to kill the pace of the campaign, cutting back on character moments so you can run around big chunks of the Utah Badlands or the Pacific Northwest forest, opening up chests and fighting random battles. Marvel's Avengers has all the trappings of a live game like Destiny 2 or The Division, with its social spaces, shopkeepers, faction vendors, and daily activities. The explanations for all these things are wedged in the middle of the campaign and, like the multiplayer missions, feel at odds with what the story is trying to deliver in its exploration of its characters.Once the campaign wraps up, you're left with just the multiplayer-focused side, which runs on continually throwing more challenging missions at you and gating those missions with gear requirements. All those treasure chests you open throughout Marvel's Avengers provide items for a loot system, in which you outfit your characters with equipment that has various stats on it. The overall average of your stats determines your Power Level, which has more granular stats that determine the damage you dish out or absorb. Power also dictates which missions you can handle and how tough they are.Like other live games, the loot chase is supposed to be the engine that drives your continued engagement--the chance at better, more powerful stuff is the reason to tune in every day or every week with your friends. On this front, Marvel's Avengers flounders a bit. Just about every piece of gear you'll find has interesting perks that can change the way you fight, offering advantages like defense against enemies with freeze weapons or allowing you to shrink or poison enemies as you pummel them. But it's only at the very top of the loot grind, as you near the cap of 150 Power, that you might actually start to bother looking at the gear you're using and what it does. Up until then, even items with good perks will get replaced in short order, since you'll continually pick up new gear with higher Power numbers as you play. Gear also doesn't affect how your character looks, which makes it feel even less consequential.The good news is that the loot chase isn't much of a loot grind. You can tear through levels at a pretty consistent clip, which keeps you from ever feeling like you're gated from content you want to play and forced to play stuff you don't. In the end, there's a fairly huge swathe of activities you can take on, with varying lengths, objective types, and difficulty levels. If you want a quick 10-minute experience, you'll have that option; if you'd rather dig in for 30 minutes or an hour, there are larger levels that can keep you busy. And the tougher they are, the more skill they demand from you in combat, and tapping into that depth is where the game excels.But like the Hulk himself, it all feels a bit chaotic and unfocused. The loot grind is ever-present but largely not something you really need to pay much attention to. Despite a lot of objective options, all the levels are relatively similar and pretty repetitive, sending you to a lot of copied locations like AIM labs or taking place on the same couple of big chunks of desert or forest. And when four heroes are wailing on the same big boss or giant robot, you lose a lot of the nuance of dodging, parrying, and constantly considering your attack options because it's hard to see through the confusion.Still, Marvel's Avengers does manage to scratch that live game itch, just like it scratches the itch for an emotional superhero story, and when its combat comes together, it can be very fun. Adventuring through the game with the different characters creates a ton of variety, which helps keep fighting a lot of the same enemies in a lot of the same environments feeling fresh. There's a lot to master for any given character, and with six on offer in the base game and more coming, experimenting with each one is a solid draw.The endgame does a great job of drip-feeding you additional activities as well, with each new level unlocking a newer, tougher one to go with a bunch of character-specific challenges to wrap up. The late-game Hive levels are essentially just five or six smaller missions stacked together and yet make for some very tough and varied fights and activities, especially at high difficulties. Fighting with human teammates especially can be a very good time. Whether you're on voice chat with friends or just picking up random teammates through the game's matchmaking, it feels good to find opportunities to help each other and work together to defeat tough foes you'd struggle facing alone. But the AI is good enough, on the whole, that you can play Avengers by yourself and stay engaged.After 50 hours with Avengers, I'm still interested in taking on tougher combat challenges and leveling up the rest of the characters--and I'm excited to see what developer Crystal Dynamics has in store with its take on four-player ""raid"" content, which is coming to the game later. There's also a lot of potential for expansions on the story side with additional characters coming to the game post-launch. They represent an opportunity for more intimate, character-driven episodes that tap into the best stuff in Marvel's Avengers, which would be a lot more enticing than just new characters to take through the same multiplayer missions.That interest has been marred along the way by technical snafus, though, especially of late. There were points throughout Marvel's Avengers when bugs popped up to break dialogue, disable interaction prompts, or load in too many copies of heroes for a mission. I've had issues where no enemies spawn during battles, or where a checkpoint doesn't trigger and a mission can't advance. Most of the problems are minor inconveniences, and some seem to have lessened since a patch was released with the wide launch of Marvel's Avengers.In the last few days, however, my game has suffered crashes and freezes often when I've played, seemingly with no cause. Though other GameSpot staff aren't reporting the same problems, posts on Reddit and Steam forums suggest I'm not alone in having major problems with the game. Sometimes I can play through a whole mission or two and even get a couple hours out of a play session, but other times, I'll get trapped on the start menu or see the game seize up repeatedly over a short period. Usually, the solution is a full restart of my computer, and attempting to fix the issue by downgrading graphics settings and hunting down new GPU drivers haven't alleviated the problem at all. I've managed to put in a lot of hours into Marvel's Avengers over the last week or so, but in the last few days as I've worked through the endgame, these problems have rendered the game unplayable at times.On the whole, I've enjoyed my time with Marvel's Avengers, and if Crystal Dynamics can deal with the technical issues plaguing the game, I'm looking forward to spending time mastering the combat styles of all the characters and exploring the expansions of its story the live game has set up. At times, Marvel's Avengers struggles to unify a thoughtful story focus with a more momentum-based, action-heavy live game system--but both have their good qualities. As with Bruce Banner and the Hulk, it'll be worth sticking with Marvel's Avengers to see how it might reconcile the two halves of its personality in the future to make something even better."
3177,Crysis 2,8.0,2,"      If you appreciated Crysis as a technical benchmark, as well as an excellent shooter, you might be surprised by Crysis 2's more modest menu options. There are a few preset graphics options (high, very high, and extreme), but the menu doesn't allow you to tweak antialiasing settings and such, as you would expect in the sequel to the highly customizable Crysis. (You can adjust these settings by entering certain console commands, but that is not an acceptable alternative to built-in menu options.) Furthermore, the game does not support DirectX 11, so you won't see the advanced lighting techniques here that you see in games like Metro 2033 and Dirt 2. But to pick these nits with much vigor would be unfair to one of the best-looking games in recent times. Crysis 2 looks stunning, runs smoothly on even modest systems, and suffers from few obvious bugs and glitches.              Fortunately, the AI is an infrequent concern once the invasion is in full swing and you're surrounded by dozens of foes roaming the maps and surrounding you. The aliens come in a few varieties. Some armored creatures might pounce on you and knock you off your feet or fire energy bolts at you. Many of them hop onto ledges and rooftops to gain higher ground. Miniboss types pummel you with rockets and are tough to bring down without a C4 charge or a few rockets. Crysis 2 offers a nice challenge, particularly in its second half; some of those aliens soak up a lot of bullets before going down. You get an array of military-grade weapons, and you can tailor them with different sights (reflex sights, for example) and other enhancements (say, a silencer). You also collect the glitter that dead aliens leave behind (called nano catalyst) and use it to upgrade your nanosuit. For example, you can improve your suit's energy regeneration, or you can unlock a fun ground-pound ability. The suit works a bit differently than it did in the original Crysis. For instance, you no longer activate power mode to jump to higher levels; you just hold down the jump key. Rather than activate speed mode, you sprint.     Far Cry 2, which may disappoint fans of the original seeking a healthy dose of sandbox gameplay. Compared to most shooters, however, Crysis 2 still offers plenty of room to maneuver. As you enter the larger areas--often from a rooftop above--the game encourages you to use your suit to scan the environment. Doing so allows you to tag enemies for assault or avoidance, and it shows you where all-important ammo and weapon stashes are located. How you approach battle is then up to you. You can activate armor mode and go in guns blazing, though Crysis 2 is not a bunny-hopping, run-and-gun shooter; the heavier your weapon, the slower your movement. Carelessness does not bring good results. Sometimes, you can avoid battle entirely by cloaking yourself and sneaking around. More often than not, you employ variations on these themes: cloaking yourself long enough to flank the enemy and then unleashing a barrage; popping a turret gunner in the head; or performing a satisfying stealth kill on a chattering alien from behind. Or perhaps you might use the verticality of the levels to your benefit, leaping to a ledge above and rushing to a better vantage point.       The resulting firefights are exceptional and unpredictable. Crysis 2's variety comes not from one on-rails sequence after another, but from busy, open maps that constantly break up your line of sight and give you a reason to use both short- and long-ranged weaponry. There are a few on-rails/turret sequences, but Crysis 2 is longer than most modern shooters--10 hours or so--and individual levels span multiple fronts. As a result, such orchestrated events don't overstay their welcome, and the game feels more like one extended experience than a series of bite-sized chunks sewn together. What makes Crysis 2 fun is that you author your own destiny by getting in an armored vehicle and squashing a few grunts under your wheels or ripping off the same vehicle's turret gun and wasting enemies.      Such diversity leads to superb shoot-outs in the final two-thirds of the campaign. It's unfortunate that the first few levels lack momentum; the story doesn't go anywhere, the environments only hint at the upcoming havoc, and the baffling AI drains excitement away. Once you finish the campaign, though, it isn't the early down moments you remember most but the thrills that erupted as you approached Grand Central Station or blasted your way through extraterrestrial hordes in a nail-biting sequence near the game's finale. Fending off leaping aliens with your comrades in a large city square is a blast: robotic hulks lumber on the ground level while agile foes skitter across ledges and fire from windows. In another momentous mission, the lights go out and you engage foes while activating your suit's heat-sensing mode.      The multiplayer part of Crysis 2 is superficially similar to that of other modern shooters, and it does a good job of keeping you engaged once you get past some technical hiccups. Crysis 2 rewards you with experience and levels as you play, but unlike the console versions of the game, you get access to all six modes from the get-go. These include standards like Instant Action (Deathmatch); Team Instant Action; a king-of-the hill mode called Crash Site; and a capture-the-flag variant. Rounding out the online options are two assault-and-defend modes: Assault and Extraction.        These game types all grant a good dose of action, though it is much different from the expansive Power Struggle matches that defined the original. Nevertheless, Crysis 2 differentiates itself from other shooters with the same nanosuit abilities as in the single-player campaign. You can cloak yourself for short periods of time and take your opponents by surprise; escape a sticky situation by leaping to higher ground; and improve your defenses by activating armor mode. The diverse maps give you plenty of opportunity to employ these skills. On the vertical Skyline map, for example, jumping to higher ground is a great way to gain an advantage over a pursuing enemy. On the atmospheric Sanctuary, stealthy players will appreciate the many archways and gravestones that shield them from view when they need to recharge their energy. It's all solid fun, and given the nature of the nanosuit powers, it's unpredictable enough to keep you invested for the long term.     PC players will be happy to note that they can join up with others using a traditional server browser, as well as the matchmaking feature, though few players seem to be using said matchmaking. That's not the only drawback affecting online play, either. Joining a dedicated server doesn't get you into a game; all you get is a pre-match room full of people wondering why the match won't start. Unranked servers seem to function just fine, however. According to the game, only playing in ranked servers is supposed to earn you experience and other rewards, but as of this review, playing unranked games has earned us experience points. For now, you can still join others and have a blast while advancing--just not in the way apparently intended.         Gaining experience is important because it forms the core of Crysis 2's elaborate system of unlocks. While you can choose from one of a few premade classes, the game allows you (in most modes) to create your own class by selecting from a variety of weapons and suit modules. These modules are many and may allow for faster firing rate, automatic warning when enemies come near, radar scrambling, and more. Some unlocks are earned by meeting the necessary skill requirement; others are tied to particular milestones. For example, you might earn a module upgrade by killing 150 enemies while in armor mode. There are many such upgrades and many ways to customize your character.      Crysis was a superb game, and it wasn't so just because of the astounding technology that brought it to life. Crysis 2 doesn't make as strong of a mark, but it comes close, and in a sea of me-too shooters, it feels unique and offers an exciting journey that's as much your own making as that of the developer. The wow factor is undercut by some AI and multiplayer oddities. But while the lows are inescapable, the highs are intense, and the more you play, the more extraordinary they become. If you give this sequel a little patience, it will bombard you with the thrills you came seeking.   game guide which includes both a full campaign walkthrough and multiplayer load outs tips.  "
4147,The Punisher: No Mercy,4.0,0,"  On paper, The Punisher: No Mercy seems like a decent value. For only $10, you get an online multiplayer shooter with eight unique levels, a bunch of characters from the comic books to play as, and enough unlockable weapons and gadgets to keep you occupied for quite a few hours. But when you discover how shallow and generic this first-person shooter is, any bargain bin thrills you get from shooting up your friends will quickly dissipate. You can blow through the Story mode in less than a half hour; after which, you have only repetitive shootouts to look forward to when you take your guns online. For such a cheap price, No Mercy fills the mindless shooter void in a pinch, but any fun is over before you know it.        The main draw in No Mercy is the online multiplayer mode, but there is a perfunctory campaign thrown in for those who want a little practice shooting up brain-dead bots before they pit their skills against more challenging adversaries in competitive play. The four story levels begin and end with hand-drawn story segments that show Frank Castle's confused reaction to fighting clones of his arch nemeses, but they abruptly end with a nasty ""To be continued"" tease before this seeing-double tale is resolved. The Story mode should provide either a conclusion to the narrative or train you for your online matches, but it does neither. Your bot opponents are devoid of tactical abilities and health, so your time spent shooting up your foes in single-player does a lousy job of preparing you for human-controlled enemies. By the time the story ends, you unlock every playable character, along with a few powerful gadgets and weapons, and a skirmish mode to extend solo sessions, but it's a pretty mundane experience.      Online play is broken up into cooperative and competitive modes, but given the fact that artificial enemies are unnaturally moronic, you have to opt for competitive action if you want opponents who put up a fight. There are a number of different modes to choose from, but all of them offer only slight variations on the classic deathmatch formula. The lack of diverse objectives leads to a monotonous feeling that even the well-designed levels can't overcome. The stages have plenty of hidden passageways and deadly sniper spots, but the intelligent layouts are largely wasted because there isn't a reason to carefully sneak around to seek out the best positions. Each fight is over in the blink of an eye. If you can shoot enemies in the back, they'll most likely die before they can even turn around, which makes for an abrupt and unsatisfying experience.     Because fights are usually over before you can think up a clever trash-talking line, matches are slightly more fun with fewer players. Most maps can accommodate up to eight people but the action is at its best when that number is cut in half. With a few seconds to breathe between encounters, you have a chance to reload your gun and pick up some much-needed health packs, giving you a chance to stay alive for a little while before finally succumbing to an onslaught of bullets. But even when you find the perfect balance of competitors, playing online still has a lot of problems. The matches often lag so much that the only option is to ditch the unreliable automatic weapons, fill the screen with fiery blasts from the rocket launcher, and hope for the best. Worse, still, are the frequent drops. When the host is kicked out, everyone gets booted to the title screen, and this happens so often that it's difficult to get into a shooting rhythm.         The upgrade system is the most interesting aspect of No Mercy, but it messes with the already tenuous balance. By earning kills and picking up power-ups spread across the maps, you can level up your guns, which makes them more accurate and powerful. These upgrades disappear each time you die, but there are permanent rewards you can earn by playing longer. If you chalk up a few hundred kills online, you unlock even more powerful weapons, as well as mods that give your character special abilities. You can only equip two mods at a time (one active and one passive), but they have a significant effect on the action. You can unlock a motion sensor, health regeneration, and even the ability to become invisible. Having upgrades to strive for is a cool idea, but the requirement to unlock the better tools is way too high, forcing players to log in hours upon hours to see the high-end offerings.       Despite a few good features, it's not worth dealing with No Mercy's unsatisfying gunplay, connection issues, and dearth of multiplayer options just to get your hands on a few unlockable items. The grating voice acting doesn't help matters either, with a near-constant stream of vulgar one-liners peppering every match. You'll hear ""May the *expletive* rats eat your meat"" so many times that the words will lose all meaning. There are a few hours of middling entertainment to extract from this comic-themed package, but other than the bargain price, there is little reason to play The Punisher: No Mercy over any other shooter on the PlayStation 3.  "
3385,Wii Party,8.0,2,"       Wii Party can be a blast if you've got a full room of friends. There's a huge variety of minigames to play; everything from kart racing to vegetable chopping. There's even a minigame that has you running away from zombie Miis (so that means zombies can mark another genre off their list of video games to appear in). You'll see a few recycled minigames and a few that seem a bit too similar, but Nintendo has thrown in a couple of unique twists that employ the Wii Remote in clever ways. A handful of minigames revolve around the remote itself. One has you passing the remote around as if it's a bomb. One person must hold a button and pass it to another. The next person has to press a button as he or she receives it--careful not shake it too much. This simple game can be a lot of fun with a group of friends with its tense mix of simplicity and precision. Another game actually asks you to hide your Wii Remotes in the living room. When the ""finders"" return to the room, they must find the remotes, which emit a sound from their speakers every 10 seconds. Another one asks you to line up your remotes on the floor or a table. The remotes will play an animal sound, and everyone has to scramble to pick up the right one. These minigames are interesting because they seem to step beyond the TV screen--it's not just you pointing at the screen and interacting with a digital rendition of yourself. These particular minigames don't require any video game skill or knowledge. They're more about having fun with a group of people, which is what Wii Party is all about.         The library of Wii minigame collections is oversaturated for sure, but don't let that stop you from checking out this entry from Nintendo. Few games pack in so much variety and charm while remaining accessible and, most importantly, fun. If you own a Wii but don't have a party game on your shelf (or even if you do already own a party game or two), Wii Party is a party you'll want to attend.  "
4636,Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,4.0,0,"  Infernal was originally released to middling reception more than two years ago for the PC, and the years spent porting this third-person shooter to the Xbox 360 have not done the game any favors. Clunky controls and shoddy cover mechanics make this an easier game to put down than to pick up, and perseverance is rewarded only with repetitive enemy encounters and inconsistent logic. The story does provide the occasional moment of levity, presenting the battle between heaven and hell in such an over-the-top fashion that it's hard to not smirk at the ridiculous dialogue. But this tiny glimmer of light is not strong enough to pull this otherwise soulless game from the depths of darkness.        You play as Ryan Lennox, an earth-bound agent fighting the endless war between heaven and hell. After being sacked by heaven's EtherLight corporation, you team up with hell's public facade--The Abyss--in order to strike back at your former employer. Your new boss is Lucius Black, the embodiment of evil, who is more than happy to give his newest turncoat agent all the information needed to destroy his rivals, as well as demonic powers so no one will be able to stand in your way. The story is full of celestial puns and silly non sequiturs; thus, the goofy dialogue makes the plot amusing and weird at times, though it often doesn't make sense. The story provides an odd contrast to the endless bloodshed of combat, but considering how wonky the combat is, this is a welcome respite.      The action plays out like a typical third-person shooter, albeit with cumbersome controls. Aiming is extremely finicky, so hitting a moving enemy or lining up a precise headshot is a practice in futility. The cover mechanic is so poorly implemented that it only serves to make the game more difficult. You jump into cover by tapping toward a solid object, but it's far too easy to get sucked into cover by accident. Getting unstuck is also a chore, so you will often find yourself desperately trying to become unglued from a box while an angry monk throws shurikens at your noggin. Double-tapping in any direction allows you to perform an invincible roll, but is too easy to pull off by accident, making you tumble around the battlefield like a fool. The idea of slowly somersaulting in front of angry men with assault rifles may seem funny, but when you roll off a five-foot-tall ledge to your death, you won't be laughing.     In addition to your standard array of pistols and automatics, you get to play around with some demonic powers. The most useful of these powers is a soul-sucking ability that lets you gain health and ammo from dead soldiers. This is a good idea in theory, moving away from the automatic health regeneration typical for the genre, but it is irritating in practice. It takes more than five seconds to pull off this action, and because you have to perform this move throughout the game whenever you need a refill, it gets extremely tedious before long. Furthermore, dead enemies disappear far too quickly, which forces you to hunt down corpses before the room is cleared of living attackers, needlessly putting you into harm's way. Another power lets you charge up your gun so it can shoot evil bullets, but your normal attackers are so weak that using this ability is pointless unless you're fighting a boss. Finally, although you can teleport both yourself and other objects to solve puzzles, these instances are quite rare; the powers feel like a missed opportunity. It's probably for the best, though, because controlling these teleportations is just as awkward as every other action in this game.         If the shoddy controls and tedious demon powers are enough to derail this shooter, the inconsistent logic dooms it. The levels in Infernal are linear, but you will often find yourself stuck because the game doesn't stay true to its own set of rules. Glass is bulletproof everywhere in game except for one section where you must shoot out a pane of glass to advance; fences can't be climbed at all or have barbed-wire at the top except for one instance where you must climb over a fence to reach freedom; switches can be triggered by teleporting nearby and hitting a button, except for one puzzle where this inexplicably doesn't work; and you can die by falling off some ledges that are only five feet in the air, but other boxes and platforms the same distance from the ground allow you to jump off with no repercussions. These inconsistencies make your quest frustrating, forcing you to go against the already established logic to progress.       Infernal: Hell's Vengeance is a forgettable shooter that spends more time irritating players with imprecise controls and illogical puzzles than it does entertaining them with thrilling action or killer set piece battles. The save system is another annoyance. There is no autosave option or checkpoints, so you must remember to save manually. Although this make it easier to bypass the trickier portions, fiddling around in the menus takes too long, destroying much of the appeal of quick saving. Even the best moments of Infernal, when enemies are swarming and explosions are going off all around you, are hampered by a stuttering frame rate that make these sections nearly unplayable.  It doesn't matter if it's bargain price, full price, or flat-out free, Infernal is not worth your time.   "
4082,Dynasty Warriors DS: Fighter's Battle,4.0,0,"  There's something a little bit ironic about the fact that Dynasty Warriors DS: Fighter's Battle, a handheld update to Koei's long-running console beat-'em-up franchise, doesn't feel like it's lost much of its gameplay in translation to the DS. Sure, the combos aren't as fancy-looking, there are far fewer warriors to play as, and the game is devoid of any measure of storyline. But speaking strictly to the combat and the methodology behind it, Dynasty Warriors DS really loses very little compared to the console counterparts. However, therein lays the sad comedy of this game: It filters out everything except the worst aspect of the console titles. The mindless sword slashing against hordes of dronelike soldiers, peppered with periodic battles against officers, is practically all you get in this game. With very little in the way of tactical strategy to the proceedings, almost zilch in the way of style, and only a few generic playable characters, you'll be done with Dynasty Warriors DS faster than you can say Cao Cao.        The game starts off by having you pick from one of three characters. There's a big, slow guy with a giant hammer; a fast, little guy with a sword; and then a well-balanced guy with a spear. There are no names, stories, or any other useful info to these characters--just stats. Once you've picked, you're presented with a map of ancient China. You're up against an opponent army headed by one of the characters you didn't choose (played by either a friend via wireless play or the computer), and with each province you select, you take to the battlefield, fighting to overtake all the enemy bases before your opponent. You do that by moving across a map with a series of squares on it.      Each square is a battle scene where you have to take out a certain number of enemies or a certain type of enemy before you can move on to the next square. The game's only real strategic element is trying to figure out the best path to each of the enemy's bases before heading to the enemy's main camp and fighting the big boss waiting inside. All the while, your opponent is doing the exact same thing. If you happen to meet your opponent on one square, you quickly duel, and the loser is sent packing back to a starting square a ways away on the map.     Engaging in combat is anything but. You've got a basic attack, which can be strung together into a four-hit combo, a special attack that does only slightly more damage than a regular combo, and then a musou attack that does a stupid amount of damage but requires a full musou meter to use. There are also some special attacks that come as you collect coins from fallen enemies. Once you get enough coins, a little icon on the bottom right of the screen starts randomizing and eventually settles on one of your available attacks, such as a hail storm of giant stones, a mild earthquake, or a whirlwind that sends your opponent to some other random square on the map. The special attacks you get to use depend on which officers you choose to bring into battle with you. Before battle, you essentially choose from a series of cards that each have an officer on them. Each has a certain number of troops, certain stat ratings, and specific attacks that become available to you. These officers also act as guardians for your bases.     It's too bad that they're basically useless at it. Defeating base officers isn't much more difficult than cutting down grunts, especially if you go into the fight with a full musou meter and lay one of those attacks on them from the get-go. Instead of making the fights remotely challenging or, you know, fun, the designers decided to try to balance out the challenge by making the special attacks insanely cheap. On the normal difficulty level, victory is basically determined by how badly you get screwed by very specific enemy attacks. You will frequently find yourself on the verge of catching up with an opponent's progress, only to get whirlwinded off to some distant corner of the map. The screw jobs even come out of apparent victories. You could win a duel with an opponent and suddenly find that your opponent has been whisked off to a new square that actually puts him in better position to win. It's catch-up artificial intelligence at its worst.        That's the long and short of the whole game...emphasis on short. You go through 12 of these battles, cutting up cheap-looking 2D sprites while wandering around sometimes confusing and always ugly squares of land. Then you periodically fight boss characters (some familiar franchise faces include Cao Cao, Lu Bu, and Zhang Jiao) until you've either conquered enough provinces to win--or not. On average, that should take you just over two hours to finish. Without any unlockables to go back to play for beyond more officer cards or any real difference between the single-player and multiplayer game, that's not a lot of bang for your buck.     Dynasty Warriors DS: Fighter's Battle is a game that will please neither the hardcore fan of the series nor those just looking for a bit of hack-and-slash on the go. The stump-dumb combat won't keep you interested for long, and the obnoxiously cheap nature of the game structure will probably have you looking for your return receipt if you don't snap the cartridge in half first. It's only what you dislike about Dynasty Warriors, and none of what you like. Take a pass on this one.  "
1330,Umbrella Corps,3.0,0,"This is a competitive shooter, first and foremost, where teams of three face off in single death elimination matches, or in a series of varying match types, including domination, bounties, and item collection races. Call them what you will, Umbrella Corps' modes are standard concepts that have been around for decades, and players are so fragile that rounds tend to devolve into deathmatch battles regardless of the overarching objective.Single player levels tend to be similarly basic--kill zombies and collect their DNA. Shooting them is an option, but why expend round after round when you can instantly kill targets with a melee attack? It's baffling that a single whack from the butt of your gun will kill zombies faster than a stream of bullets, but it does.The small selection of maps in the game is directly inspired by the last few numbered Resident Evil games, and apart from the presence of zombies and unlockable character skins, are the strongest ties to the series at large. Despite their familiar appearance, the maps' inner-workings have some fresh appeal. While in Umbrella's labs, you can snake through ducts to get the jump on an unsuspecting enemy, or, in the game's outdoor locations, you can scurry up walls to gain a height advantage. In a game where most people constantly sprint and fire, it feels good to be able to disappear into the environment and wait for prey to cross your path; it's also an easy way to bide your time during single-death matches.Umbrella Corps is at its best when it allows you to utilize your surroundings, but this isn't always possible. Most games with a cover system allow you to snap to any structure of a certain size, such as a wall or a crate, but not here--only some objects are eligible, highlighted with a neon outline. Sure, you can hide behind any wall in the face of incoming fire, but only some walls--ordained without discernible rhyme or reason--allow you to enter a proper cover state and fire from safety. Because of this, you quickly learn that relying on cover is a fool's errand. Ultimately, characters move so fast, and kill each other so quickly, that you become accustomed to looking for enemies rather than hunting for cover opportunities.You can kill opponents in three ways in Umbrella Corps: you can shoot them, kill them instantly with a melee attack, or disable their Zombie Jammer and rely on zombies that litter every map to get the job done. Every player has a jamming device on their back, which allows players to move around the map without rousing suspicion from the undead. When it's disabled--triggered by a well-placed shot to a player's back--zombies rush towards their newfound target. This is a great option in theory, but in practice, it's very difficult to execute. Whether you're standing, crouching, or prone--where you slither around like an awkward greased seal--you can cover a lot of ground with minimal effort, which results in a lot of twitchy and chaotic face offs where opponents frantically attack anything that moves.While you can melee enemies with your gun, you might as well equip the Brainer if you prefer close quarters combat. Your Brainer is an overpowered, hybrid scythe-hammer that kills opponents in one hit, so long as they fall in the weapon's generous kill zone, indicated by a HUD projection. Using it comes with a risk--the Brainer's attack animation is notably long--but it's the fastest way to take out an enemy. Should you and a Brainer-wielding enemy attack each other at the same time, you both stagger for a moment before you can issue a follow-up attack. Typically, this results in a flurry of button presses as you try to attack again as soon as the game allows--but with both competitors mashing away, it becomes a game of luck rather than skill. Relent and try to switch weapons, and you'll probably die. Spend too much time trying to issue a counterattack, and you're likely to get killed by an enemy who's passing by. The Brainer is both the most effective tool in your arsenal, and the most likely to get you killed.You can try to adjust your strategy to account for the Brainer's peculiarities, but there's nothing that can be done to combat Umbrella Corps' broken death animations. In some instances, it takes a full second or two for a death to properly register in the game, and in that window of time, the doomed player can attack and kill others before they are disabled. There's probably a joke to made in there about how the dead don't stay dead in the world of Resident Evil, but this is a bug--not a feature--and the final nail in the coffin for a game pitched as a competitive shooter.Determined players can earn cosmetic items and new weapons as they earn XP and level up, but a new gun or patch for your helmet doesn't wash away the bad taste of Umbrella Corps' gameplay. Its systems are either unreliable or illogical, and as a result, it feels almost impossible to get a foothold. The first time an enemy kills you when they should have been dead, you may shrug it off. When it happens the dozenth time, you'll probably wonder why you're playing Umbrella Corps at all. There's ultimately no good excuse."
1591,Wander,2.0,0,"Unlike other massively multiplayer games, Wander does not begin with you tuning sliders and picking palettes to create a character or accepting a fetch quest from a non-player character, because neither of those options exist. Nor do you have to kill ten of X, because combat or creatures are nowhere to be found. The only to-do list is the list of achievements, most of which read like chores. Wander focuses on exploration and wants to be a refreshing new contender, yet it’s nothing more than a glitchy, boring mess. Instead of embracing the aforementioned genre standbys, Wander starts you off playing as a humanoid tree creature known as an Oren. This Tolkien-inspired being moves around the island at a grueling pace trying to find a transformation stone as soon as possible. The forest floor only has a few paths at the beginning, yet you can still find a dead end, requiring you to backtrack at the speed of a turtle. The game, whose sole purpose is exploration, penalizes you for doing just that in the first five minutes. Once finding the stone in a nearby cave, the Oren shrinks and becomes a Hira: a nimble figure with fins that act as a wingsuit. Once you transform, there’s no reason to even think about returning to your prior ineffective form. However, shortly after freeing myself from the Oren’s fetters, the game crashed, and I knew this would be an unpleasant walkabout. As a Hira, you can glide like an ice skater, walk under water, stop time, and burrow through earth. Oh wait--those are movement glitches, bugs, not features. The graphics are another imperfection. Although it was made with CryEngine, Wander looks like an extension of Playstation Home. Textures are flat and dull, if they even load at all. Trees and vegetation flicker in and out of existence as they sway in the coastal breeze. Ponds vanish, and you swim through the air and on dry beds of rock. The plants farther down the road are identical to the ones that came before, and my eyes glazed over scanning the thick brush for something unique or captivating. Each summited outcropping teases a view of a breathtaking landscape, but disappointment sinks in every time. The Hira is a marooned sailor destined to die from monotony on an island prison. Wander’s narrative is supplied via lore stones, which are similar to the audio logs found in games like Bioshock. These rocks provide meaningless blurbs discussing flora and fauna rather than any actual story or plot. After finding the first lore stone, the map room is unlocked. In this cave, you can also switch between four different forms, such as an aquatic lizard or a flying griffin, at will. However, the relief map itself is useless without a “You Are Here” marker. In addition to the lore and transformation stones, pillars give the gift of speech. Each found stone lets players speak necessary words, like “hello,” and extremely specific terms that you will never need to utter, like “thermal.” You say sentences by drawing the corresponding glyph on the DualShock’s touchpad and hoping the gods accept your handwriting. Chances are they won’t. Thankfully, there’s an alternative method, but it requires cycling through each individual gleaned word on the D-pad. Then, when the controller is idling on the coffee table, random words will sound without any input--not to mention, the same tutorial for the Rozhda language system plays, even if it’s your tenth time finding a glyph. The touchpad is also used to summon fireflies, but they never heeded my call, so I can only guess at their function. Luckily, I didn’t find any chatty players, so I was never forced to piece together a fragmented phrase from an obtuse mechanic. The only respite provided in Wander is the lovely soundtrack composed by Benjamin Woodgates. The soothing vocals contrast with the grating gameplay and give life to the vacant land. However, the music rarely plays, and most sounds that graced my ears were the chirping of invisible wildlife. Otherwise, Wander is a sandbox constructed from rotted wood that lacks toys. Without character customization or any semblance of proper communication, the game has nothing to offer in place of its sacrifices. Like Sisyphus on a treadmill, I fruitlessly walked around in hopes of discovering something worthwhile. Unless this game can find its way, discovery will remain a lost cause."
1968,Grand Theft Auto V,6.0,1," Using money from the stimulus package that Rockstar gave players who accessed the game in October of last year, I bought myself a swanky penthouse apartment, with pretty art on the walls and a gorgeous view of the city below. But what's the point of such material wealth in a world as bleak as that of Grand Theft Auto Online? You're still as vulnerable as any other soul unfortunate enough to be living on these violent streets. At least in single-player GTA, there's a story structure if you want it, offering a larger goal to work toward. In GTA Online, there's no greater purpose to fight for, and you share the world with other people who also have nothing meaningful to strive for, so the result is a nihilistic world in which life is dirt cheap, with players constantly gunning each other down for no reason whatsoever. (There are warnings that bad behavior will result in players being pegged as bad sports who are relegated to playing with all the other miscreants, but in a game designed to encourage murder and mayhem, it's hard to discern where the line is between fair play and being a jerk.) If there's a meaning to be found in Grand Theft Auto Online, it's in the way that, through depicting a society with no opportunities to do anything constructive or meaningful, it underscores the things in our world that actually are meaningful.  Even if some material goods are the only source of meaning you need to motivate you in Grand Theft Auto Online, you're in for some frustration, because earning money is an arduous process, and everything in the game is so expensive. You can easily blow a hefty chunk of change just outfitting yourself with a reasonable assortment of weapons and ammo at Ammu-Nation. Saving up for a modest house or a luxury sports car means many, many hours spent stealing cars and doing jobs. They say crime doesn't pay, and the shockingly small payouts for so many jobs in GTA Online only enhance the feeling that sinking time into a life of crime here is pointless. The meager payouts are likely designed to nudge you toward buying in-game cash with real cash. At the low end, three bucks nets you $100,000, which doesn't go very far in GTA Online. At the other extreme, you can shell out a hundred bucks for a cool $8,000,000 in online dollars.        "
3282,Bejeweled 3,8.0,2,"  If you own a computer or a smartphone, there's a very good chance you've played, or at least heard of, Bejeweled. The popular puzzle series has been immensely successful, and for good reason: its compelling gem-matching gameplay is approachable enough for almost anyone to immediately pick up, yet it rewards skillful play, making it appealing to those looking for a good challenge. Bejeweled 3 delivers more of this ageless puzzling and harbors few surprises. This is the sequel you probably expected--a natural, cautious follow-up to a puzzle classic. What's different is the context given to tradition. New modes mix up the pace with mostly positive results, and there are undeniable thrills to be had when a time limit forces you to make quick decisions. Unfortunately, Bejeweled 3 doesn't boast enough growth to justify its $19.99 asking price. But as familiar as it is, this iteration of a beloved game will keep you glued to your chair, swapping jewels and losing hours of your life to the power of red rubies and blue diamonds.           Flow, Flower, and The UnderGarden. It wants to relax you, but the bizarre result isn't relaxing as much as cheesy--though the cheesiness provides its own kind of entertainment. This is an endless mode in which you can turn on relaxation-tape noises, such as seagulls and waves, and perhaps you will be able to calm your nerves in this manner. The other options in this mode are less likely to relax you than make you giggle, however. You can turn on mantra messages with themes like ""weight loss"" and ""positive thinking,"" but these pronouncements (""My body is perfect right now"") are more quaint and kooky than inspirational. You can also activate other features, such as a breathing indicator, but they seem out of place. Good ambient games are successful because every element is built around a singular idea. Bejeweled 3 layers its eccentric concepts onto a game that wasn't created to support them, and it's a combination that doesn't gel. Nevertheless, an endless mode is always welcome, and even if the pleasure you get is more zany than Zen, it's pleasure all the same.         It speaks to Bejeweled's classic core gameplay that it still inspires the same one-more-round compulsion of its predecessors. The bright jewels, the glassy plink-plink noise of successful matches, and the deep bass of the announcer who cries out ""excellent"" with the gravitas of a sorcerer splitting the earth make it easy to stay under the game's spell. Yet this spell has been cast before, and in spite of its new modes and clear appeal, Bejeweled 3 is about as safe a route as developer PopCap Games could have taken. The match-three-or-more gameplay hasn't evolved, so it's hard to shake the sense that you've played this game before. At a price of $19.99, you might reasonably have expected more from a Bejeweled sequel--at the very least, online leaderboards or Steam achievements that allow you to show off your gem-matching skills. Alas, Bejeweled 3 features neither, which makes them disappointing omissions in a score-focused puzzle sequel from a major developer.      But it's the safe approach that will make legions of Bejeweled fans happy as they swap jewels and race the clock to better their previous scores. Bejeweled 3 is the kind of game that attracts almost anyone, whether you are a longtime video game player or the grandparent of one. And the best of the new modes are so fun that there are still reasons to splurge for this sequel and ignore the high price point--even if you've explored the depths of every Bejeweled game and clone in existence. Whether you have a few minutes to kill or want to lose yourself for an hour or two, there's something here to satisfy, though you'll surely be struck by a strong sense of deja vu.    "
3997,Invictus: In the Shadow of Olympus,5.0,1,"We've seen it countless times before, and we're sure to see it again: a game that sounds great on paper, but doesn't come close to delivering the experience we were expecting. Call it the G.O.P. syndrome, and welcome Invictus as the newest victim. It's got a great premise, but unfortunately its gameplay is wholly uninspired and singularly uninventive, especially considering the cloth from which this game was cut. The premise of Invictus is rich with potential: It uses the heroes, characters, monsters, and gods of Greek and Roman mythology as the basis for a real-time strategy game, and includes some role-playing elements for good measure. It's a concept sure to intrigue anyone who has thrilled to the excitement of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and all the wonderful tales in Edith Hamilton's legendary book Mythology. Even if you've never delved into Greco-Roman myths, it's easy to see that they'd make a good premise for a game. In Invictus, you're cast as a human who's basically a pawn in a heated argument between Athena and Poseidon. Miffed that Athena constantly aided Odysseus after he killed Poseidon's son, Poseidon says that not only should the gods stay out of human affairs but that Odysseus was just plain lucky. No other human could ever pull off something like that again. Athena responds that any old mortal could do it provided he listens to her sage advice, and she backs up her big talk by proposing a friendly little wager - the mortal of her choice must earn Poseidon's respect by passing a series of trials, or else all of humanity will be drowned. Of course, you are that mortal. To aid you with your task, you can choose two famous heroes from the annals of mythology to accompany you, and up to two more will join you as you progress. There are ten heroes in the game - Achilles, Arachne, Atalanta, Cadmus, Electra, Hercules, Hippolyta, Icarus, Orion, and Perseus - and though the designers took some creative liberties to make the characters into suitable hero types, the extensive list reveals their passion for the subject matter. You'll also get to hire all sorts of standard units, including cavalry, spearmen, swordsmen, and archers, as well as more exotic warriors like gorgons, minotaurs, amazons, and even animals like black bears. Invictus relies on many real-time strategy conventions, making it simple for anyone who's ever played one before to jump right into the fray. But newcomers would truly appreciate the game's excellent tutorial, which not only teaches you just about all you need to know but also has a pretty good sense of humor. Unfortunately, the jocularity is taken too far once you start playing the game, as the characters spout tired (and anachronistic) cliches like, ""Let's get ready to rock 'n' roll!"" You have a lot of control over your units and can have up to 20 units in your army. You can group them, order them to assume prearranged formations, create new formations for them on the fly, set waypoints for them to follow, and adjust their bravery and aggressiveness levels. But at the core of your fighting force are the heroes you pick to assist you. Each one has an ""appeal,"" a special power bestowed on the hero by the gods, which he can use provided he has enough ""god points"" to make the request. The appeals are varied and powerful, and run the gamut from elemental attacks like lightning, fireballs, earthquakes, and tornadoes to the ability to summon skeletal warriors, transform into a venomous spider, and increase movement speed. You'll be sorely tempted to use appeals early on during each mission, but unless you've stockpiled plenty of god points, you should hold off on using these lifesavers until the situation is dire. Unfortunately, appeals don't discriminate; if you have Icarus call down a tornado, it can wreck your own war party just as it can wreck the enemy. Not exactly what you'd call divine intervention. The lands where you do your adventuring are peopled with all sorts of characters with whom you can interact. Some offer advice, some sell goods, some just gripe, and so on. These nonplayer characters must have been tossed into the mix to give Invictus the atmosphere of a role-playing game, but most of the time the characters just act like windup robots as they repeatedly bark the same lines and move stiffly about the prefab village they supposedly inhabit. You might appreciate the services these puppets provide - being able to buy armor, healing potions, and upgrade units in the middle of a quest can make the difference between victory and defeat - but when all's said and done, they're little more than talking vending machines.But bad NPCs are hardly unique to Invictus, since they're oftentimes just as stupid even in full-blown role-playing game. Unfortunately, Invictus also falls short in just about every other category you can think of. What's even worse is that the whole premise of the game, which has you playing the role of hero, is shot all to hell by the fact that you never even see your character. Combat is plentiful in Invictus as in most real-time strategy games, but it's laced through and through with problems that will annoy you from the very first mission. For example, there's the game's adjustable perspective: While it's nice to be able to tweak the viewing angle, using the rather imprecise keyboard inputs makes it tricky to find the best angle. For instance, when you hit the insert key, the screen whirls round so fast that you really can't stop where you'd like to. Fumbling about on the right-hand side of the keyboard is a real nuisance, and the inability to remap the keyboard controls means you'll just have to live with the bad controls. Because several of your quests take place inside closed environs or cramped villages that can't be viewed from a good angle, you simply can't make optimal use of your forces during battle. Then again maybe you can, since combat in Invictus drags on for what seems like an eternity. A thousand years may be but a blink of an eye for a god, but a gamer will probably find his patience being pushed to the brink countless times during the battle sequences in the game. You might send three axemen, two swordsmen, and a couple of cavalry riders to polish off a single enemy axeman. It should take all of about five seconds for your overwhelming force to send this guy to the Elysian Fields, but instead your men will pound away over and over again, with mightily mediocre sound effects adding even more miasma to the affair. Before long, every single encounter feels just like the one before it: an endurance test rather than a strategic or tactical challenge. If the Trojan War had been fought like this, the moniker ""The Hundred Years War"" would have been snatched up centuries ahead of time. At first, the unit-formation options seem useful, as your minions will line up just as they should, be it in a line, wedge, or even a box. Unfortunately, the formations are practically useless in the areas where you're often forced to fight: They'd be great on a big open plain, but they're no use inside a city or inside a maze. What's more, how your units form a wedge depends on the order the characters appear in the selected units box - and if you've group-selected them by clicking and dragging, that order is automatically set and can't be changed. The voxel graphics in Invictus neither inspire nor offend. Battle animations are limited to about eight frames per character, which adds an even more turgid aspect to the already tedious battles. What's more troubling is that standard units can't grab important objects and icons - apparently only heroes have opposable thumbs - and that the unit pathfinding and artificial intelligence are simply atrocious. Try to guide your heroes out of danger, even after setting their bravery and aggressiveness levels to the point where they should be fleeing from a water nymph, and the moment you switch control to someone else they head into battle like angel-dust Aegeans. Sometimes. You really never know what they might or might not do: A centaur might stand around pawing the dirt while his friends take a major hurting from their enemies, while at other times your heroes plunge headlong into destruction. And trying to get someone to simply round a corner and head into battle can be a major undertaking; a couple of times I had to set waypoints just to get a unit to go around a wall. There are other problems with Invictus, but the true death knell is that the missions aren't fun, inspired, or particularly challenging. They might be timed, or they might hinge on locating an object or person - but whatever the goal is, it feels contrived. The one area where Invictus could have shined is in its multiplayer game - at least Interplay lined up some type of matchmaking support using Mplayer - but the game's poor AI, lousy pathfinding, and tedious combat means there really isn't much point. So no matter how much you're into mythology, it's very likely that you won't enjoy Invictus - and that means you're best off not spending money at your local software outlet in hopes that you'll actually like it."
1613,Mortal Kombat X,8.0,2,"reboot in 2011, Mortal Kombat matured from a curious fighting game series to one that's worthy of tournament-level competition, and with Mortal Kombat X, we get the next step in the evolution of its fighting system. New features such as fighting-style variations and a stamina meter enhance the chaos, giving you more to consider before and during a fight. As much headway as Mortal Kombat X has made in regards to the fighting system, the series' other mainstay trait has grown in step. Fatalities and other gruesome attacks are the series' goriest yet, and while not all of them fall into the slapstick category, there are plenty that make you laugh due to the absurdity on display. Mortal Kombat X upholds the series' legacy, which is evident in the story mode and the return of a dozen classic characters. Once again, the focus is on the battle between realms, elder gods, and humanity. The introduction of a few new faces on the side of Earthrealm, the good guys, freshens things up, although not as much as you would hope. The inclusion of the offspring of legacy characters, like Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade's daughter, Cassie, may prove to be intriguing for die-hard fans of Mortal Kombat's lore, but with the exception of Takashi Takeda (Kenshi's son) and Kung Jin (the younger cousin of Kung Lao), most of them are too similar to their relatives and ultimately fail to stand out in a meaningful way. There are also a handful of new bad guys, though ""fresh"" may not be the best word to describe their grotesque visages. Characters such as the insect like D'vorah and the gunslinger Erron Black inject new personalities into the series' aging roster and introduce new fighting styles. D'vorah strikes with spider-like arms that spring from her back, Erron Black uses firearms, and the fighting duo called Ferra Torr is comprised of a little girl who commands a hulking brute from atop his back. The new characters on each side of the battle fit into their respective factions, but it's the bad guys that are most notable, largely because they are original creations, rather than derivations from pre-existing characters. If you care about Mortal Kombat lore, you will get a lot out of the story mode, which has excellent voice acting and a handful of unpredictable developments that affect long-standing relationships. It's not a story that everyone will relate to, sadly, with only a couple of scenes that deliver emotional moments. Cassie Cage may be a boring character, but she provides the necessary motivations for Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade to explore their feelings, and ultimately, grow as people by the time the credits roll. Even if you don't care about the made-for-fans story, it's hard not to appreciate the new fighting engine, which is the smoothest the series has ever seen. It's not a sea change from the last game, but you quickly appreciate that combos are more fluid and that animations are more nuanced. The meter you charge by taking hits and doling out special moves returns from the last game, allowing you to power-up special attacks, break enemy combos, and perform an x-ray attack, which reveals the insides of one opponent while the attacker breaks them into pieces in slow motion, accompanied by excruciating moans of pain. The introduction of a stamina bar limits your ability to spam dashing maneuvers, which makes it more difficult for you to rely on spacing alone to win a fight. Likewise, the interactive elements in each stage, which allow you to pummel your opponent with a background item, or escape a corner by leaping off of a large object, can only be used if you have enough stamina. This particular meter recharges on its own, but it takes long enough--relative to the pace of a heated battle--to make it an important consideration during high-level matches. Local battles are great fun, but online matches are where modern fighting games thrive in the long run. Chances are, the best players in the world don't live on the same street, leaving online matches as the true test of one's skill outside of tournaments. The netcode that drives Mortal Kombat X's online matches is fine, meaning that it will sometimes offer an experience that feels proper, but that you should expect laggy matches from time to time. When you get into a fight with a poor connection, you may as well exit and search for a new opponent, because it will be difficult to pull off simple combos and special moves. At that point, its a competition between man and machine. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence. One of the great aspects of Mortal Kombat X is the amount of non-traditional fighting game content. Towers are back, providing an arcade mode-like challenge, as well as a series of other themed battles that offer a wide variety of combat conditions. The Test Your Luck tower puts you in a series of fights with randomly selected modifiers, which mix up everything from terrain to physics to keep you on your toes and alter the way you approach a fight. The modifier-driven fights are also the crux of the new living towers, which offer fixed modifier sets and challenges, but are remixed every hour, every day, and every week, depending on the specific tower. Mortal Kombat X also marks the introduction of factions, or teams, that compete on a worldwide scale. Joining a faction is the first thing you do after booting up the game, and as you fight in the game's various modes, you earn points for your faction and level up. Eventually you hit milestones that open up faction kills, which are essentially simpler versions of fatalities. Every week, a faction is chosen as the winner and its members earn a reward in the form of a faction kill or a cosmetic item. Once in a while, an invasion occurs and factions compete to fight a character with extreme rules, and the more you play, the more you contribute to the team's efforts. The faction system isn't the sort of feature that will grip your attention, but invasions are nice because they make you feel like you're contributing to a concentrated effort, rather than the long-winded score chase of the weekly faction war. As you play Mortal Kombat X, you earn currency in the form of ""koins."" Koins are used to unlock movelist details for secondary fatalities (by default, secondary fatalities don't have inputs listed in the movelist menu), brutalities (another form of finishing move), fan art, and character skins, to name a few. You find these items in the Krypt mode, which is a first-person dungeon crawling game. The Krypt is composed of a handful of areas that are populated with tombstones, sarcophaguses, and other treasure chest-like containers. You need to spend koins to get at the treasures within, but there's a catch: you never know what you're buying until you've purchased it. This adds an air of suspense and tension to each purchase, because you're either going to get something cool, or something lame. This would be easily dismissed if koins were more plentiful than they are, but they're currently doled out in small doses. One trip through the story mode nets you enough koins for but a small fraction of the items on display, and other modes are less generous, making the chase for unlocking the entire Krypt a long and arduous one. Like factions, it's not something worth focusing all of your effort on. Save that for learning characters and fighting styles, and go to the Krypt only as needed. There is another option: you can pay real world money to unlock every item in the Krypt. All you need is $20 to bypass the slog of earning koins, but that isn't exactly cheap. Then again, neither is time, so it's a bit gross that the koin distribution is balanced in such a way that you are tempted to spend real world cash if you want to unlock brutalities and the like. Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game with a wonderfully demented world and cast of characters, but when you're pressured into spending money, it's easy to lose focus on the positives. You can always ignore the options to buy items with real world money, such as awards that allow you to perform two button fatalities and the aforementioned Krypt unlocks, but the biggest item on the main menu of the game is a link to the game's store, with items you can purchase or look forward to purchasing in the weeks and months to come. You're teased with DLC for characters that you fight within the story mode, as though you aren't going to put two and two together and realize what a despicable bait and switch that is. There's so much to love about the new Mortal Kombat that it's a shame to see such blatant monetization practices overlap with your experience, whether you're looking for it or not. You can always choose not to pay out of pocket for anything, but you know in the back of your head that you're likely missing out on something. Mortal Kombat X's lesser elements exist outside the most important part of the game: the fighting. A great roster with a wide range of diverse fighting styles and variations gives you plenty to play around with, and the new fighting mechanics add the right amount of depth to nudge Mortal Kombat X ever higher on the list of respectable fighting games. There's also the gruesome creativity, which is entertaining for its absurdity but shocking for its emphasis on acute torture. Although you can't escape it, Mortal Kombat X's violence doesn't come at the cost of great gameplay design; it's either your punishment for failure, or your reward for mastering the art of kombat."
2847,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,9.0,2,"   Oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments--pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents. Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Skyrim's atmospheric tone harks back to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, only the hazy dust storms of the earlier game have been replaced by glimmering snowfall and opaque fog.      These lovely vistas are best seen from a distance. Closer inspection reveals plenty of ugly painted-on textures, and the PS3 version suffers from a general blurriness that diminishes the overall visual impact. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a great impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next. You could follow the story, of course, which weaves a compelling tale that casts you as a dragonborn; that is, the soul of a dragon emanates from within you. As such, you are the key to discovering why dragons have returned to the land, terrorizing cities and potentially ending the known world. The tale has you facing dragons, of course, but also crashing fancy dress parties and scouring sewers in search of a key figure long assumed dead. It's a well-crafted tale that makes good use of those fearsome flying creatures that horrify the masses with roaring gusts of fire and ice.        Even when you aren't pursuing story quests, though, the core narrative dogs you as you trot across the land on foot or on horseback. You might travel to a quaint hamlet only to discover that it's under siege by a hovering beast. The townspeople join you, aiming their arrows and fireballs upward, and not all of them may survive the encounter. These battles impress upon you the terror in which the populace lives, and thus give you a reason to be a hero to them. But plenty of narrative delights have nothing to do with dragons, and some of them could have formed the main story of a lesser RPG. Following an early lead takes you to a lonely house occupied by a single child with a disturbing request. The story that unravels has you acting as a predator and eavesdropping from an unimaginably sinister hiding place. Other story threads embrace the element of choice. You can take sides in the ongoing conflict between Imperial forces and the rebellious Stormcloaks, and then assault enemy camps and rescue prisoners jailed by the enemy. And in one memorable if minor quest line, you can kill a creepy cannibal--or join her and her cohorts at the table.      It's impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Searching for a lost dog turns into a grander quest than you could have guessed--and witty writing and voice acting shine some light into this somber world. Even a simple ""go there, kill that"" bounty can be a thrill. After all, how often do you face a towering giant and a couple of woolly mammoths? It's too bad that as you approach the giant's camp, one of those mammoths might spawn 100 feet in the air and fall to its death, or land on another mammoth and ride on its back for a few seconds before sliding off.        So maybe not every surprise is a welcome one. But most are, and the element of the unexpected is what lures you to explore as much as you can. The reward could be a great weapon hidden in a locked chest, a gorgeous vista to ogle, or a book of lore that enhances one of your attributes. Or perhaps you'll discover words written in the dragons' tongue--an important discovery indeed. Finding those words is key to using Skyrim's most powerful spells, known as shouts. Well, they are half the key anyway: you also must defeat dragons and absorb their souls to activate those shouts. Shouts have their own cooldown timer and aren't tied to the magicka bar that governs standard spellcasting. With one shout, you can breathe fire on your attackers. With another, you can slow down time. Shouts hardly guarantee success in a difficult battle, but they can tip the scales in your favor. Besides, the dramatic visual and sound effects of both the discovery of words and the absorption of a dragon soul are a lovely bonus.      As for standard spells, they come in the usual schools of magicka: destruction (zap skeletons with sparks!), conjuration (summon a giant frost atronach!), alteration (light the way ahead!), and so on. You can even dual-wield spells, going full-on mage, with a glowing ball of fire in one hand and a summon at the ready in the other. For that matter, you can dual-wield one-handed weapons, giving you more flexibility in how you form your character. When you create your character, you choose a race from the usual Elder Scrolls standbys (Dark Elf, Breton, Argonian, and so forth), but you don't choose a class. Rather, your skill level with certain types of weapons, magicka schools, speech, and so on is governed primarily by how you play. Wear heavy armor, and taking blows gradually increases your heavy armor proficiency. Swing two-handed weapons, and you get better at using them.       That doesn't mean that you don't wield manual control over how you progress. Each time you gain a level, you choose to enhance one of your three main attributes: health, stamina, or magicka. You also earn a single point to spend on a perk, which might increase damage done with axes or let you conjure creatures at a greater distance. It's a great leveling system that forms around the way you play, but allows for tweaking so that you retain a sense of control. Even just the act of leveling up can be a pleasure due to the slick and colorful interface that imagines perks as stars in constellations. It can be a pain to navigate to certain perks; the game often has you flitting not to the star you want, but to all the ones surrounding it. But considering Oblivion's cumbersome interface, Skyrim's is a much improved beast. On console (and if you play with a controller on the PC), thumbstick navigation minimizes button presses, and you can easily move between your quest log and the main map. Additionally, you can mark weapons, spells, and items as favorites and then access them quickly during combat. Certain aspects might be fiddly, but on the whole, Skyrim's interface is a wonder, considering how much information and inventory is at your fingertips.      Fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. What hasn't been improved is the friendly AI. It's nice to have a companion along for the adventure, and you're given one for free early in the story. But companions are morons, crowding you in tight passages, lagging behind when you need them the most, and even getting stuck in various death loops caused by spinning blade traps.      If you're the stealthy type, you can sneak about, picking pockets and breaking into homes. If you really enjoy keeping to the shadows, you may even wish to contract porphyric hemophilia--that is, vampirism. Vampires earn some benefits by way of certain spells and status effects, but also endure particular risks and must feed on unsuspecting victims as they slumber. But even if you like to wade directly into the fray, you can benefit from Skyrim's non-combat activities. Lock-picking no longer works as it did in Oblivion, but takes its cue from Fallout 3, having you rotate a lock pick and turn the lock to determine how closely you matched the correct position. As before, you can pick flowers and collect ingredients, and then create potions out of them at an alchemy table. (Forget mortars and pestles this time around.) And any adventurer can benefit from enchanting, which lets you imbue your equipment with certain status effects--though you must use soul gems to recharge their power.       Many of Skyrim's delights are the touches that occur outside of the action. Citizens go about their daily lives, selling their wares in shops during the day and closing down at night to hang out in the pub or head home to rest. Under some circumstances, they may comment on your rancid breath or remark on how sickly you seem to look. Children run up and down the streets; one may even ask for you to stop a bully from picking on him. Citizens move somewhat stiffly, but with more grace than in previous Elder Scrolls games. Before, conversations brought the world to a halt and focused the camera on some character's waxy face. In Skyrim, certain dialogues limit the camera and temporarily paralyze you in place, but overall, conversations feel more organic than before--a nice improvement that enhances your sense of immersion.     Skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here. If you don't feel like reading up on Tamriel's rich history each time you find a volume, grab it and read it later--there are a lot of narrative tidbits that deserve to be read. Elder Scrolls fans will appreciate nods to events in prior games, and everyone can enjoy the bite-size tales contained therein, about vampires, noble heroes, and gods that bestow their blessings on their followers. Skyrim takes place hundreds of years after the events of Oblivion, and organizations you might remember have been restructured or are shadows of their former selves. But Tamriel's history is threaded throughout Skyrim's fabric, and some quests, such as one that begins with an invitation to a faraway museum, are great reminders of past misfortunes that the world has not forgotten.     you could get stuck in the environment, maybe just by walking into a corner, which forces you to either quick-travel to a different location (if you're lucky enough to be outdoors) or load a save game. And on the PlayStation 3, frame rate jitters and occasional pauses can disrupt the moment-to-moment flow. The question isn't whether you will experience anomalies--it's a given. The question is: which ones and how many?     If you've played previous Elder Scrolls games, glitches and oddities don't come as a surprise. Nevertheless, Skyrim comes in a year graced with multiple quality RPGs that feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, better animations, and so forth. But to be fair, none of those games are endowed with such enormity. Yet The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim doesn't rely on sheer scope to earn its stripes. It isn't just that there's a lot to do: it's that most of it is so good. Whether you're slashing a dragon's wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at the alchemy table, Skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it.

800,Gwent: The Witcher Card Game,8.0,2," Editor's note: After two years in beta, Gwent is now a standalone game. It released alongside Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, a single-player game with Gwent mechanics. While the Gwent and Thronebreaker are connected, they are separate applications, and we have reviewed them separately. You can read or watch our full Thronebreaker review or read on for our full Gwent review.The Witcher 3, Gwent was an enjoyable but arduous side activity, only rewarding for those patient enough to scour the open world in search of more powerful playing cards. If you weren't inclined to do that, you'd miss out on much of what made Gwent a unique take on collectible card games. Gwent, now a free, standalone multiplayer game, gives you the room and resources to really enjoy it. Its rules are shaken up to provide an even playing field for veterans and newcomers alike, and it establishes a deeply rewarding loop that encourages you to stick with whichever of its various factions interest you most.Gwent's fundamentals haven't changed much since The Witcher 3. You're still restricted to playing one card per turn, with the goal of attaining a higher power value than your opponent in each of three total rounds. Each card has an individual power value attached, and your total score will increase the more cards you commit to each round. If you feel as though you're outmatched or similarly far enough ahead in any one round, you can choose to pass and save your current hand for the next. Given that your ability to draw new cards is limited, having more cards in your hand gives you a tangible advantage. Gwent rewards calculated restraint, which makes knowing when to fold and when to go all in an important part of its strategy.The big differences lie in the structure of the board. Previously Gwent featured three rows, one for each type of unit. That's been reduced to just two now--melee and ranged--and you're free to choose either for your units. Certain units will have abilities that you can only activate when spawned on a certain row, while other units that deal damage to enemies will have their range limited to one or two rows ahead of them. With fewer limitations on card placement, you're able to play Gwent with more fluidity. Experimentation with row-specific abilities and how they link up with cards already in play affects the board in significant ways during a single turn. These new rules keep rounds unpredictable at times and let the tide of the skirmish shift frequently. Having to decide between a big play or holding back for subsequent rounds makes for an engaging test of strategy, with no single approach being best in all scenarios.The flexibility doesn't help the stagnant pace of matches, though, where each player turn feels far more drawn out than it should. Given the limited number of actions you can take a turn, it's frustrating to watch an opponent stall on playing a single card. Gwent could also benefit from more helpful visual feedback on card abilities and triggers, as I often found myself fumbling a play by placing a card into the wrong row simply because I missed a single word of text on the card itself. Boards should ideally give you more contextual information to work with when you select a card, so that you're not stuck reading each card repeatedly to make sure you're making the right play.Cards are segmented into five different Factions, each of which requires a distinct strategy to play effectively. The noble Northern Realms specialize in cards with abilities like Deploy (which are triggered when you play a card) and Order (which you manually activate after meeting certain conditions). Monsters, conversely, enjoy strategies laden with Deathwishes that unleash often devastating chains of events when certain creatures die and head to the graveyard. You'll have a starting deck for each Faction when you initially begin Gwent which helps in familiarizing you with each of their differences. But it's also important to experiment with and figure out which Faction speaks to your style of play, and you'll have to decide where to invest your rewards from wins as you go.Reward trees sprawl out on parchment maps, with one for each Faction and sub-trees for each of their respective Captain characters. Nodes on these maps can be unlocked with Reward Points, which you'll earn frequently by completing challenges in-game. These can be as easy as playing a certain number of cards during a match, or as complicated as eliminating a large number of enemy cards in a single turn. Unlocking nodes rewards you in multiple ways, including small gifts of in-game currencies and big bundles of card packs called Kegs. Each map rewards you with respect to the Faction it belongs to, incentivizing you to spend points on the Factions you play most. It emphasizes the need to experiment with different factions and settle on your favorites beforehand, as the influx of Reward Points slows down after clearing many of the easier challenges.In-game currencies are plentiful in Gwent, and each serves familiar purposes. There's one that acts as the standard fare for purchasing new card packs, another that helps in the crafting of new cards, and a third that can be used to spruce up existing cards into shinier, animated versions of themselves. Gwent rewards you well for match wins (and additionally for matches where your opponent congratulates you, which is a nice touch) which makes progression towards your next card pack feel balanced. Combined with currency rewards you'll get from reward trees, I found it easy to amass a large amount of each resource in a handful of hours. Gwent is generous with how it rewards the time you invest in it, giving you the means to build up a formidable collection of cards before tempting you to spend real money on it.Gwent clearly learns from other digital collectible card games that have carved their niche out of the market, but its play style offers up an entirely different type of challenge.That's not to say that time will eventually come, unless you're planning to keep up with the shifting metagame that CCGs generally employ to keep things fresh. Gwent's in-game store gives you many options for purchasing bundles of resources and some alluring starter packs that reward you with a generous number of Kegs to open.Gwent clearly learns from other digital collectible card games that have carved their niche out of the market, but its play style offers up an entirely different type of challenge. It's one that requires some investment, and hard decisions on which Faction you'd like to invest in, but Gwent also respects your time by rewarding you for nearly every action in a match, tempting you to play just one more. Its matches could use some fine-tuning in their pacing and presentation, but Gwent is otherwise a refreshingly new take on card games that establishes itself firmly outside of the simple side activity it was in The Witcher 3."
1831,Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day,6.0,1,"Akira, but one year prior to the film's theatrical debut in 1988, Otomo contributed to Neo Tokyo, a collection of animated shorts featuring works by some of Japan's most talented and recognized animators. Otomo has since made a habit of organizing or contributing to other collections, including Robot Carnival (1991), Memories (1995), and most recently, Short Peace. What sets Short Peace apart from the rest of the collections is the inclusion of a game, Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day, from Tokyo Jungle studio Crispy's, and Suda 51, the creator of games like No More Heroes and Killer is Dead. Currently, there's no way to purchase Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day without also acquiring the accompanying animated shorts. When I consider the bundle in its entirety, it's easy to recommend. The four animated shorts tackle a variety of subjects including Japanese mythology, love and desperation, bonds between man and nature, and the trajectory of a society that's wound around weapons technology and armed conflict. They deliver plenty of eye-catching animation, exciting art design, and succinct stories that intelligently get their point across. The first short, Possessions, tells the story of a run down, waterlogged tailor who stumbles upon a derelict shack in the middle of a forest. Upon entering, he's confronted by an array of haunted objects, including tattered umbrellas and obis--traditional sashes worn by geishas. Rather than balk in fright, the tailor's good nature and positive outlook shine through, ultimately earning the spirits' friendship and allegiance. It's a heartwarming, Disney-esque tale with an invigorating presentation that's packed with movement, intricate details, and an uplifting, brilliant palette. Possessions is a bright first course, but the tale of lovelorn youths separated by tradition and family values in the next chapter, Combustible, stirs up a different and darker set of emotions. Two sets of hard-nosed parents inadvertently create a divide between two entangled teens, Owaka and Matsukichi, and the events that follow tap into wells of sorrow, futility, and sacrifice. It's an unpleasant conclusion to a story that blossoms from an idyllic prologue, which depicts Owaka and Matsukichi's early years, when their days were defined by play and unadulterated joy. The melancholy ending to their story sets the tone for the third short, Gambo, where a little girl appeals to the sensibilities of a wild bear to come to the aid of her village, which is under attack from a hellish demon. Gambo is rousing in its brutality, and it both extends and builds upon the somber tone set by Combustible. The fourth short, A Farewell to Weapons, brings the emotional roller coaster back to where it started. In the midst of recovering a warhead, a futuristic salvage crew is attacked by an autonomous, quadrupedal weapon. The combat sequences between man and machine that follow are riveting and filled with inventive displays of sci-fi technology, destruction, and tension. By the end, however, you're brought back to a state of tranquility. The transition is abrupt, but it also works, and it feels like a fitting end to a string of stories that manage to flow together on an emotional level despite being so different. What remains is Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day, a game filled with an animated story of its own. Ranko, a confident and popular high-school student, has a grudge. No, it's not with a classmate, but with her father. Student by day, assassin by night, Ranko is not to be underestimated. As her story unfolds, you encounter a small yet colorful cast of adversaries, watch Ranko's friends evolve, and ultimately face off against her father. Written by Suda 51, it's a fittingly absurd journey that's confusing at times, with numerous details seemingly left on the cutting room floor. Though it's a forgettable tale, it's presented in some very interesting ways, transitioning from contemporary anime visuals to the grotesque and psychedelic end of the animation spectrum. It's enjoyable from a visual standpoint, with great looking 3D-as-2D animation, but it undermines its value with unnecessary up-skirt and down-shirt shots that feel like ugly blots of ink on the composed, thoughtful works that make up the rest of Short Peace. Unfortunately, the gameplay in Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day is equally shallow. For the majority of the game's ten brief levels, you sprint through streets and subway stations in an attempt to reach the goal, doing your best to stay free from the grip of the ever-pursuant enemies on your tail. While dashing, jumping, and hovering over obstacles, you need to attack enemies that stand in your way by slicing them with your sword or sliding into them. These encounters pay off in simple yet satisfying explosions of color, which can lead to chain attacks that hit nearby enemies. Every enemy you defeat fills up a small portion of your ammo gauge, which comes in handy. You're meant to constantly move forward, but if your pursuers catch up to you, you need to exhaust some of your ammo to send them packing in order to buy yourself some time. Apart from one level that forces you to use a particular skill to advance without telling you, you can get through most levels easily and quickly. There's a dash of variety in gameplay towards the end, including a shoot-em-up-style level and a pixelated battle that's reminiscent of the original Mario Bros., but neither are interesting enough to positively influence your impression of the game at large. Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day is never challenging, nor remarkable, and it's premise is both devoid of creativity and lacking in execution. There are no innovative mechanics to explore, nor interesting level designs to overcome. The game can be pretty, but that's about the best you can say about it. There's the suggestion that you're intended to replay levels for the sake of high-scores and quicker completion times, but considering how uninspired the gameplay is, you'd need a really good excuse to venture down that path. Despite the title's suggestion, Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day is brief, lasting just over an hour. Unfortunately, that hour is underwhelming from both a gameplay and storytelling standpoint, and disappointingly shallow relative to the caliber of the accompanying content. Perhaps it's not meant to be taken too seriously, like many of Suda 51's creations. But, when put next to the rest of the collection, it's hard to excuse the immature nature of Ranko's animated sequences, which aren't bashful about showcasing the ""sexiness"" of its teenage cast. It's not the primary focus, but among the mishmash of themes and scenarios that arise, it's the one that stands out from the start, and it's unfortunate that the gameplay doesn't find a way to rise above and wash away the flavor of tastelessness. While Ranko's tale brings very little to the table, it's faults don't detract from the best parts of Short Peace: Possessions, Combustion, Gambo, and Farewell to Weapons. These works are easy to digest, feasts for the eyes, and proof that there's more to Japanese animation than the overdone and immature tropes offered in Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day. Come to Short Peace for the variety of content, stay for the imaginative and masterful animation, but leave Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day at the door unless you're in desperate need of something to pass the time."
2279,Rain,7.0,2," The Metamorphosis is exemplified in Rain, as is Casablanca's vision of forging a relationship in a troubled land.   Without the rain, you're nothing. Seek shelter from the unrelenting storm, and your body disappears. It's only when you're cold and drenched that you become slightly visible. Monsters lurk in the empty alleyways, afflicted with the same condition as you. Hide from them by vanishing under an awning, and then race through the downpour when their backs are turned. Rain is a puzzle game set in a desolate cityscape in which moving ever onward is your only option. And though the boy may be cleverer than the deadly threats, he isn't stronger. One bite from the roaming creatures ends his life, so you must avoid them at all costs. Push boxes and clamber up scaffolding to find a path to freedom, always mindful of what one misstep can lead to. As the girl runs away from the figure that's always chasing her, she's unaware of your existence. Does she think it's luck when a pathway opens up? Or is she so focused on escape that she doesn't even question how she is being saved? It doesn't matter. Only her safety does. Eventually, you join her. No longer must you solve puzzles on your own. Instead, you work in tandem, always alert to the unknown stalker nearby. The storm has swallowed your voices along with your bodies, so your communication is limited. A frantic halting motion or a friendly wave is the only way you can talk to each other, but what is there to say? You're both lost in this world, desperate to survive, and so you just keep walking, searching for a way out.   Survival is the overarching goal of every puzzle. You keep out of sight of the monsters and search for a link between this haunted world and your own. Because of your limited abilities and the few objects you can interact with, there aren't many barriers halting your progress. Create a distraction by banging on an organ, and then carry the key toward the locked door. Lure the roaming monster toward the scavengers who attack anything that moves. Without taxing conundrums to give you pause, Rain moves constantly forward, letting you focus on the plight of the two troubled children. It's in the predictability of the puzzles that Rain loses its footing. Too often, the puzzles seem forced, a manufactured reason to do something. So you dutifully do what you must, though without much engagement. Ideas are introduced and then quickly forgotten. The boy's feet becoming visible when he steps into a muddy pool or the docile creatures creating shelter above you never evolve into mechanics that could add more diversity to the tired rhythm. It's only when the puzzles and story intermingle that Rain reaches its potential. When the boy hoists the girl to safety while he stays behind, trusting that she will save him too, you feel his anxiety: you put so much faith in this stranger, and it's rewarding when she doesn't let you down. Rain has a straight-ahead style that urges you to plunge deeper into the dreary world. That there are no distractions is to the game's benefit because you're always focused on the immediate dangers, causing you to become more immersed. When you complete the adventure, however, a new game plus opens up that adds depth to the core offering. Hidden memories fill in many of the ancillary questions that arise, giving you a reason to explore alternate paths to learn every detail of what unfolded. You finally learn details about the boy and the city before the darkness enveloped them, and these tidbits give you further insight into the background elements. Rain pulls you in from the early moments. The abandoned city that you roam through is beautiful in its gloominess, and the quiet piano score adds subtle background texture without overwhelming the other aspects. The pieces of Rain meld wonderfully together, and as the story comes to a tense conclusion, it becomes absolutely riveting. But there are hours between the evocative opening and cathartic ending that go through the motions. There's little engagement when the puzzles fail to complement the story directly, instead offering separate tasks you must complete. Because Rain reaches some impressive high points, however, it's still a haunting tale of compassion and trust in a dark land."
4168,MLB Front Office Manager,4.0,0,"  Sports management simulations have finally hit the big time. After years of indie obscurity, at least in North America, the genre has finally been hauled into the mainstream by EA Sports and 2K Sports. But don't schedule a parade just yet. EA's NFL Head Coach series has gone through some growing pains over the past couple of years, and now 2K Sports' MLB Front Office Manager is off to a shaky start. The biggest problem with this latest attempt at taking management sims to the masses is a gamepad-oriented interface that makes even the most routine tasks about as irritating as trying to throw a curve ball while wearing oven mitts. Clunky controls and a near-total lack of feedback make it hard to feel like you're in control of anything, let alone a $150-million big-league ballclub stocked with equally extravagant egos.        The basic approach on display here, however, is time-tested. The game follows in the footsteps of independently developed baseball management sims like Out of the Park Baseball and Baseball Mogul by putting you in the shoes of a Major League general manager. You start off by naming your virtual head honcho, selecting from a few face and clothing options (are you Joe Suit or Johnny Polo Shirt?), and picking a personal background that determines your skill at specific duties. If you set yourself up as an ex-manager, for instance, teams on the field get a leadership boost. If you take the low road and choose the legal profession, you receive a helping hand when it comes to contract negotiations. As time goes by and you chalk up wins in the Majors, you gain experience points that can be spent on bulking up other skills.     There is no option to work your way up to the Show from the minors, so following this brief character creation you simply pick a Major League team and grab the reins. You have pretty much total control over your club from this point on. Budgets, lineups, pitching rotations, allocation of scouting dollars, trades, and so forth are all under your watch, although you can flip over to automatic and let the CPU take care of the more mundane jobs. The team owner sets a player budget that serves as a de facto salary cap, but beyond that you're free to do whatever you want. If you have a bad run, though, you can find yourself bounced to the curb and awaiting job offers from other clubs. Virtually all of the hardcore stuff serious baseball fans expect is present here, including the Rule 5 draft, player arbitration, and bidding on Japanese prospects.     Careers can be played as straight single-player campaigns, as a fantasy variation that employs a rotisserie-style scoring system, or in online leagues with up to 30 players. Just about nobody seems to be playing the game online, however, and we couldn't scrounge up a single open league. It's still only the start of February, but the lack of players isn't good news considering that real pitchers and catchers are reporting to MLB training camps in just a couple of weeks. This is also the first baseball game to hit stores in 2009, so you would expect a little more online excitement around it.        At any rate, the foundation of MLB Front Office Manager is solid. It looks very good, as well. Because the game was designed with the Xbox 360 and PS3 in mind, the PC version has larger-than-necessary menus that give the game something of a glitzy arcade sheen. Big, bold letters and numbers splashed on the screen have a strong visual impact. This is a real plus in a genre where most of the competition comes from indie developers and looks more like spreadsheet programs for the office than something you would want to relax with at home. 2K Sports makes great use of its MLB license, loading the game up with a wealth of player photos and an attractive manager's screen where you can watch the action unfold on the diamond and make calls from the dugout.     Implementation is where everything falls apart. A good sports management sim needs to have a database at its heart. This sounds like a dreadfully dull way to present a game, but it is an absolute necessity in this genre since you need to be able to easily sift through stats and sort players by the numbers. Yet here you're working with screens almost entirely taken up by visual chrome and player photos, save for a relatively small area filled with a couple of columns of players and the barest minimum of stats. Player lists are abbreviated so that you can see only eight names on the screen at once, forcing you to tediously scroll through multiple menus. Information is presented in an almost nonsensical manner. The player negotiation screen, for instance, covers just six core stats for batters and pitchers, like AVG and W-L. So you're forced to go rummaging around elsewhere in the rosters to dig up thorough information regarding essential data, like at-bats and hits allowed.        Vital data, such as overall player ratings and potential ratings, is often tucked away in layered information screens, necessitating a ridiculous amount of searching whenever you take on even the most rudimentary task. It's tough just gathering the information needed when setting up pitching rotations. And it gets even worse when it's time to sort through the dozens of players who need the protection of a 40-man roster prior to the Rule 5 draft every winter. The menu screens aren't linked to one another either, meaning that you can't zip from one screen to another. When you're trying to re-sign a player, for instance, and he tells you he wants more years on his contract, you can't move directly from the e-mail telling you about this demand to his negotiation screen. Instead, you have to scroll down the main menu to Transactions, open its submenu list, scroll down to Payroll, open it up, and then scroll down that list to the player's name to pull up his contract offer page. It's the same deal with CPU-offered trades. They are a bit more user-friendly in that you at least have the ability to instantly go to a comparison screen where you can check out the players on the block. But leaving this screen strands you back at the main menu, and you have to access your e-mail again to accept or reject the deal (which, incidentally, cannot be altered). Even the simplest roster-management tasks require five or six steps when they should necessitate just one. You spend more time chasing your tail than making baseball decisions.        A lack of feedback makes MLB Front Office Manager even more confusing. Although you have Oakland A's GM Billy Beane on tap providing tips about contracts, along with memos that keep important dates on the top of the screen so you don't forget about something like the arbitration, much of what you do takes place in a vacuum. This is a particularly huge problem when it comes to handling players. While you're kept well informed about looming deadlines, offers to free agents, to pending free agents, and to other teams during trade talks are dealt with through pretty much absolute silence. There is no back and forth with player agents or rival GMs, or any chance to counter an offer from another team. All you get is a flat acceptance or denial with an occasional personal observation, such as that the money being offered is ""laughable.""     Signings aren't even properly noted in the e-mail screen that covers all league communications. You would think that losing Manny Ramirez to free agency would be enough of a big deal to the Dodgers to warrant more than an e-mail buried among all the other league news of the day. A successful signing never gets much press, either. If you ink somebody like K-Rod, you don't even receive so much as a cheesy ""I'm looking forward to playing for you this year!"" blurb. The only indications that your bid has been accepted are a one-line e-mail, maybe a follow-up note saying that the fans are excited, and notice that the player in question has been added to the Pending Transactions list and must be assigned within 10 days or released.        Finally, some of the decisions made by computer GMs are beyond bizarre. Every team in the game seems to be working under the same management philosophy. Each offseason, everybody appears to go after the same big-name free agents no matter what sort of budgetary restrictions they may be operating under. So this leads to ridiculous scenarios where poorer clubs like the Kansas City Royals waste $16 million a year on a washout like Jason Giambi, or the Cincinnati Reds dish off $21 million a year on Mark Teixeira. Sometimes these single big-name signings fill up nearly a third of a team's overall payroll. Team budgets are also all over the place. The LA Dodgers start off with a budget of $111.6 million, while the cheapskate Toronto Blue Jays begin 2009 with a whopping $139.2 million. Somebody either hasn't checked the lowly value of the Canadian dollar lately or has a hate on for Dodger blue. Some trades come from the dark side of the moon. While most are nondescript affairs shuffling minor leaguers around, the game hits you with a Bizarro World blockbuster on a regular basis, like when the Red Sox trade away Jonathan Papelbon during spring training for some guy named Nate McLouth. There may be some kind of bug in the game with Papelbon though, since the Sox seem to ditch him for a lower-rated nobody in the first spring training every time you start a career.     MLB Front Office Manager needs a lot of work to be ready for the big leagues. The game offers an impressive amount of depth and great support for online leagues, especially for management-sim-deprived consolers. But playing it is such a chore that anyone seriously interested in such simulations will quickly move on to a more serious, if PC-only, effort like Out of the Park Baseball.   "
2153,Knack,4.0,0,"Mercy is not part of Knack's vocabulary. He happily uppercuts a defeated enemy into a steaming lake of molten lava and flings an aircraft by its tail into the unforgiving ground. And don't believe for a second that he sheds a single tear for the pilot engulfed in the flaming wreckage; Knack doesn't let sentimentality distract him from a good fight. The only thing he desires more than brutal destruction is finding creative ways to exterminate his many foes. At least that's how the cutscenes play out. When you're given control, Knack mindlessly punches his way through corridor after corridor of enemies, and you're left wondering why Knack gets to have so much more fun than you do. Oppression is the theme that binds Knack's overarching narrative together. Goblins have been forced from their lands by the imperialistic humans, and after surviving in the wastelands for generations, they finally have the power to mount a rebellion. Goblins aren't the only creatures who have to deal with oppression. Knack was created by a benevolent doctor who has found a way to turn ancient relics into a sentient being. The philosophical implications of this discovery flip the very notion of life on its head. As Knack muses about the nature of love during a quiet cutscene, you realize that, like Frankenstein's monster, he is capable of self-reflection and poignant observations. And yet, he is treated like a weapon. Does he deserve to be viewed as an equal even though he was birthed through alchemical experimentation? Such ruminations are glossed over. Instead of realizing his humanity, Knack usually acts like a meathead, cracking his knuckles while he waits for his next fight. Instead of realizing his humanity, Knack usually acts like a meathead, cracking his knuckles while he waits for his next fight. Relying exclusively on combat isn't inherently bad. There are plenty of games that slowly build on their fighting mechanics and provide enough twists and detours to keep you riveted. However, Knack's combat lacks the necessary depth to captivate your senses. The core problems stem from your meager repertoire. Knack has only five ways to attack the many enemies who confront him, and you learn every one of these moves in the opening tutorial. Three of these attacks--a whirlwind, a projectile blast, and a shock wave--serve as special powers that can be activated only when you collect enough sunstones. Another, your jump attack, propels you toward your enemy as a wrecking ball. But because both you and your enemy recoil when contact is made, you can't use this as the setup for your combos. Which leaves you with the standard punch. So you punch, and punch, and punch some more, for that is how victory is achieved in Knack. There is weight behind your attacks that makes you understand the pain you're causing, and slow-motion finishers hammer home just how strong Knack is. But solid mechanics mean nothing alone. Because there is such little variance between fights, you're quickly lulled into the bored stupor of predictability. Knack absorbs relics into his body, which allows him to grow from a pint-size pet into a hulking monstrosity. Remember when a mere goblin took three hits to kill? Well laugh at those miniscule fools as you plow through them without breaking a sweat. Behold Knack, destroyer of goblins, devourer of worlds! Sounds pretty amazing, no? No is right. As you get bigger, so too do your enemies, so there's no difference in how fights play out. You still just punch your way to success and perform the weakest double jump known to games, only now you're fighting tanks instead of men. During a moment of enlightenment, Knack realizes that his ever-changing body can be composed of more diverse parts than just relics. Ice, wood, and other materials automatically get pulled into the vacuum of your body in certain levels, shifting your appearance from runic golem to elemental beast. But said changes are only skin deep. Sure, a flaming arrow may melt your icy heart, so you can lose your outer shell that serves as a shield, but there's no mechanical difference between normal Knack and his earthy counterpart. Still, Knack does occassionally introduce ideas that hint at a real evolution. For instance, in some levels, you have a crystalline body, which initializes Stealth Knack. It's finally time for some real variety, right? Not quite. With the tap of a button, Knack can walk through the laser beams that serve as a high-tech security system. But enemies can still see you, even though you're invisible. It's hard to stifle a laugh when the doctor says, ""No more sneaking around"" after an enemy shoots at you, as if sneaking was ever an option. So you punch, and punch, and punch some more, for that is how victory is achieved in Knack. There are 13 chapters in Knack, and every one of them plays out in the same tired manner. You start out small, gradually build your size until you're huge, and then arbitrarily shrink back down when the chapter wraps up. There's always a convenient excuse for this transformation. How else could Knack fit in a biplane if he doesn't lose his precious relics? And then you start the whole cycle all over again. In the beginning of the eighth chapter, the doctor plainly states that you must grow as large as possible, as if we somehow missed the pattern that has been cemented from the onset. If you're craving exploration, there are opportunities to veer slightly off the main path if you have sharp eyes. Weak walls can be knocked down to find extra relics and sunstones, along with collectible treasures that imbue Knack with new abilities. There are tons of collectibles strewn throughout Knack's expansive worlds, but these pieces are worthless on their own. If you're lucky enough to complete a set, you get a perk that gives you a passive ability. It wasn't until I reached the ninth chapter that I completed my first gadget, more than eight hours into my adventure. And what did I receive after all that effort? Enemies released a small amount of sunstone power when defeated. Don't expect these collectibles to inject the diversity Knack so desperately needs. It's hard to stifle a laugh when the doctor says, ""No more sneaking around"" after an enemy shoots at you, as if sneaking was ever an option. The most baffling part of Knack is its surprisingly high difficulty. Considering the cartoony artistic design and simple mechanics, you might assume that this game would be a cakewalk. But after you die a half-dozen times in the tutorial, that belief will be banished from your mind. When Knack is in his smallest form, he dies from just one or two attacks, and can stand only a couple more when he's bigger. So death comes frequently. If you're vigilant, you can avoid enemy advances by performing well-timed rolls, but even these should be used with caution. You're not invincible when rolling, so you can't abuse this maneuver. Now I love a good challenge, but dying is an annoyance in Knack because the combat sequences aren't interesting enough to play through once, let alone multiple times. There is a cooperative mode if you need a helping hand or want to offer one. Knack is as vulnerable as ever, but the second player controls Robo Knack who respawns after dying. Sadly, the action isn't any more fun when you're dragging a friend along for the ride. Knack's downfall is that it focuses entirely on combat, but doesn't offer enough variety or depth within its system to compel you onward. Any early thoughts you may have that there must be more to the punch-punch-repeat action than meets the eye are banished once you plow through hours of the same basic sequences. And even Knack's few attempts at diversity are merely competent. The occasional platforming scenario lacks the joy of movement so necessary for jumping to be engaging, and the platform placement doesn't require any cleverness to surpass. There's not one element of Knack to rally around, to excite you. And without that special something, Knack crumbles just like its piecemeal protagonist."
787,"Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu! / Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!",8.0,2,"Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee are gorgeous--albeit lean--reimaginings of one of the series' most beloved adventures. While some features fans have come to expect are missing--like abilities, breeding, and held items--Let's Go has an admirable amount of depth for a game aimed at a younger audience that has never played a Pokemon RPG. Both games may not have the same lasting appeal as previous entries, but revisiting Kanto and catching some of the series' most iconic creatures makes the journey worthwhile.Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee take you back to Kanto, the home of Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow. Not much has changed structurally, but the previously 8-bit region has been realized in vibrant detail. Revisiting some of the series' most memorable locations like Viridian Forest and Saffron City on a big screen is an absolute joy. Areas that were once composed of lines and simple shapes are now colorful forests and detailed cities. Pokemon both big and small roam the wilds, giving personality to the region--you can watch a tiny Horsea speed through the waves or a massive Onix slink through a dark cave. The catchy original soundtrack has also been remastered, and it sounds better than ever.Those familiar with the originals or their remakes, FireRed and LeafGreen, should have no trouble navigating the world. After you're introduced to your partner Pokemon (Pikachu or Eevee depending on the version you choose) you set out on an adventure to collect Gym badges, defeat the Elite Four, and put an end to Team Rocket. While there are a few surprises, the layout of the region and your progression through it is nearly identical to the originals. Fortunately, Let’s Go sheds some of Red, Blue, and Yellow's more archaic designs. For example, HMs--""hidden moves"" that allowed you to get past certain obstacles--are replaced with ""Secret Techniques"" that fulfill the same purpose without taking up one of a Pokemon's move slots. As a result, you can focus on team composition and complementary move sets instead of figuring out how to divvy up HMs between your party Pokemon.Let's Go also does a much better job at guiding you through the world and story. After you made your way through Rock Tunnel in the originals, you had little direction through Lavender, Celadon, Fuschia, and Saffron and could do certain Gym battles and events out of order. It was easy to miss key items and wind up fighting Pokemon much stronger than your own, which led to frustrating backtracking with little idea of what to do next. While you still can complete certain beats out of order, Let's Go ensures you don't miss anything crucial. For example, after you beat Erika in Celadon City, a character gives you a key item that will let you enter Saffron City. Previously, you had to buy a drink from an inconspicuous vending machine on the roof of the department store and give it to a city guard, and if you failed to do so, you wouldn't be able to fight the sixth Gym Leader.One of Let's Go's most fundamental changes is how you catch Pokemon. Instead of the random encounters and wild Pokemon battles of previous mainline games, Let's Go adopts Pokemon Go's catching mechanics. Pokemon roam the wilds in real time, and you have to walk into one to initiate catching it. Then, rather than battling it to whittle down its health, you just have to throw a Poke Ball at it, and the timing and accuracy of your throw increases your chances of a successful catch.The new catching mechanics are a welcome change to the formula that breaks up the pace of traditional trainer and Gym battles. Although catching wild Pokemon doesn’t require as much strategy as it did before, the act of catching is far more engaging. You don't need to worry about accidentally defeating and therefore failing to catch a rare or one-time Pokemon, and if there's a Pokemon you don't want to catch, you simply avoid it. The absence of random encounters also makes traversing caves a lot less tedious. Yes, that means you can even avoid Zubats.Let's Go encourages you to catch Pokemon more so than any other mainline Pokemon game, and it's better for it. Sure, catching every single species has always been the overarching goal, but I've never felt more inclined to complete my Pokedex. Catching Pokemon is the most efficient way to level up; with each successful catch your entire team is awarded a generous dose of experience. This alleviates the need to spend significant amounts of time grinding and makes it easier to experiment with different party compositions.Let's Go also introduces Catch Combos, which occur when you catch the same species of Pokemon multiple times in a row. As you build your combo, your chances of running into rare and powerful Pokemon increase. You can even find Pokemon you typically wouldn't find in the wild. Catching repeat Pokemon is both useful and satisfying--it's great knowing that luck is not the only factor involved when trying to catch a rare Pokemon, and it's very hard to stop when you're deep into a combo, knowing something good could spawn.However, the new catching mechanics don't come without issues. The Joy-Con motion controls are inaccurate at best and unpredictable at worst. Over the course of my journey, I never found a reliable way to throw a Poke Ball to the right or left. In most cases, I would just wait for the wild Pokemon to return to the center of the screen before throwing a Poke Ball, and even then, the ball wouldn't always go where I wanted it to.The Poke Ball Plus controller, an optional Poke Ball-shaped accessory, is a bit more precise, but because there are only two physical buttons on the controller, navigating menus and interacting with the world can be a pain. As novel as it is to see Kanto on a big screen, handheld mode is the best way to catch wild Pokemon. You can either use the Switch's gyroscope sensor or the left control stick to line up a throw. It's far more precise than the other methods, but you do have to consider the Pokemon's size and distance.Despite changes that make the Pokemon experience more accessible than ever, Let's Go is surprisingly deep. It does an excellent job at easing new players into some of the more complex mechanics without being bogged down by tutorials. Each Pokemon still has six base stats and one of 25 natures, and the game seamlessly presents all that information to you. For example, whenever you switch Pokemon during a battle, you are shown its stats. You can get through the entire game without paying attention to a Pokemon's stats, but it's helpful to see that information presented clearly and often. Early on, you even get the ability to ""judge"" a Pokemon, which lets you see its base stats (also called IVs). While this may not be super useful for beginners, it's presented in a way that's easy to understand and it gives veterans the opportunity to check for Pokemon with good stats early on.Unfortunately, those invested in the competitive side won't have as much to sink their teeth into. The absence of abilities, held items, and breeding limits the potential for highly competitive play. You can farm for Pokemon with higher stats through the aforementioned catch combos, but even if you do manage to catch a Pokemon with the stats you want, you won't have much to do with it. The online features are limited, and there's no matchmaking or ranked battles where you can test your skill.The trading features are also limited. The Global Trade System is nonexistent, and there is no Wonder Trading; you can trade and battle online and locally with friends, and that's about it. The barebones trading features may be disappointing at first, but given the smaller roster of Pokemon, I never felt that I needed the GTS or Wonder Trade to complete the Pokedex. This is also true for the Pokemon Go-compatible Go Park, which allows you to transfer any first-generation Pokemon you have in Go to Let's Go.It's a useful feature--especially if you are having trouble getting version-exclusive Pokemon--but you can easily complete the Pokedex without it.Without the competitive mechanics fans are accustomed to and the limited Pokedex, it can be difficult to come back to Let's Go after the credits roll. While there certainly are reasons to revisit Kanto once you have finished the game, like completing the Pokedex and grinding for Pokemon with perfect stats, the pull isn't quite as strong. There aren't many surprises and what's there isn't all that enticing. The last thing I need to try is the Pokemon Go connectivity, which isn't available as of this writing.Despite changes that make the Pokemon experience more accessible than ever, Let's Go is surprisingly deep.Despite these concessions, Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee are delightful reimaginings of the series' origins and a deep RPG in their own right. It makes a lot of smart improvements on the original Red, Blue and Yellow while holding on to what made them so special in the first place. Fans of the series might be let down by the lack of features they've come to expect, but Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee take the Pokemon formula in some exciting new directions."
839,Wasteland 2,8.0,2,"One of the most beautiful facets of Wasteland 2 is its wistful, austere writing. Taking lots of inspiration from tabletop RPGs, Wasteland 2 masterfully brings the best bits of open-ended roleplaying games to the digital realm, bringing the genre's hallmark nuanced scenarios, deep roleplaying, and rich, atmospheric description along. Several years after its release, it's coming to Switch, and even now it's among the best in the recent roleplaying crop.The Director's Cut, an updated release that was a free upgrade for most console players, is the edition getting the Switch treatment. There are thousands of lines of added spoken dialogue, but the text still does most of the heavy lifting. The bigger additions are the smoother graphical presentation as well as having more minutiae with which to customize your characters. Perks and Quirks, for instance, give you the option to swap a boon for some persistent disadvantage. While that sounds counterintuitive in a video game, it pays dividends in the actual role-playing: It gives you the ability to further refine your squad and encourage yourself to think a bit outside the box as you work around the traits. For some, that might be a turn-off, but Wasteland 2 embraces it.You are, from the start, invited to craft your own troop of folks with whom you will travel the wastes. You can (and probably should) come up with your own backstories and use those to build out your squad. You don't have to, of course, but having a written paragraph or two, as well as hand-crafted motivations, Wasteland suggests, will help tie you to the world and your team of avatars. And damned if it isn't dead-on. While Wasteland 2 definitely offers up a decent chunk of narrative assistance for those who want to keep things simple, this is an adventure that pleads for you to give your all and is willing to reward the effort.As you might suspect, your squad's goal is to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. And, as is so often the case, it's obvious that the end of civilization came in the nuclear flavor. Soon after the opening, your crew joins up with the Desert Rangers, one of the only semblances of civilization that has emerged from the chaos.Your group struggles alongside the people you encounter, and you can be assured that their lives are exactly as dour as they seem. By giving the people you encounter such depth--which, admittedly, still can often descend into cartoonishly exaggerated moral extremes--it can be a genuine struggle to be cruel. Still, kindness isn't the panacea you'd perhaps hope.One moment stood out to me when I first played Wasteland 2, and it's just as haunting today. As I wrote in my original review: ""One particularly tough scene had me slowly watching a woman die as she begged my squad to put her out of her misery. Trying to show an ounce of mercy in an otherwise cold and macabre place, I agreed. A child saw me and ran to tell his family--another group I had agreed to help by finding their stolen pigs. They were terrified of me, and left their home without food and water. They probably died.""Those consequences are made all the richer by your investment and your choice to engage with what the game has to offer. There is an unusually broad number of solutions to just about any problem, and it's often better to examine as many possible angles as you can before acting. Still, there's an anarchic resignation that underpins everything. No matter how you act, you'll often cause collateral damage. That posits a rather severe world, but then again, this is a hypothetical where people really did poison the planet and vaporize one another.The fuzziness of it all tests your characters, too. And they can (and should) be rewritten as you go. Wasteland 2 doesn't just hit you with these conditions to wear you down, but to see how your characters respond. This is trying, it is exhausting emotionally for your crew. How do they handle that? Will their spark of optimism be ground away by the relentless struggle, or will it live on? More importantly, why?The breadth of options to approach any given scenario or various other challenges is vital to backing that up. While the game has been touted as one where you can kill absolutely everyone, that really isn't wise and is a self-indulgent waste. In much the same way, it is possible, however unlikely, to make it through just about all of the game without killing people. That's less exciting for many, but it highlights the real point. The array of choices you can make are a means to an end--how would your character respond to this grim world?To that end, combat is also remarkably diverse. In much the same way that your team can flex to meet the needs you encounter, combat, too has a lot of different ways to approach problems. At its most basic, when you shift into fights, you'll be arranged into a turn order and you proceed maneuvering through the area until all hostiles have been dealt with. Non-lethal options exist, but many of your foes are mutants, robots, and other rough-and-tumble, battle-hardened mercenaries. Maintaining control of the field against enemies willing to pull out high-yield explosives is a challenge, to say the least.But that also hints at the relevant outcomes from the fight. Wasteland 2 is an RPG first, and your battles will have narrative consequences. As a result, your goals are often a little more refined than ""blow it all up."" And those going that route will be hard-pressed to care for the members of their team, who are just as vulnerable to the searing hot shrapnel from a stray grenade as your target is--so what you have is an array of options that are constrained by practical considerations.Wasteland 2 seamlessly translates the myriad diplomatic and social options into a wide set of combat styles and approaches.How much collateral damage are you okay accepting? How much risk are you willing to accept? When your crew starts bleeding out, will you run a medic over to patch them up, putting both at risk, or press the offensive? These options also have their own contexts within the narrative. How you use your party's skills to address puzzles and challenges in the main arc will have a big effect on if and when someone comes after waggling their creaky, rusted rifles.Wasteland 2 seamlessly translates the myriad diplomatic and social options into a wide set of combat styles and approaches. Once again, more investment in the weapons your team carries and uses yields dividends. Having a few different types of weapons and the ability to support each, as well as an understanding of how to use them, allows your group to tackle just about any problem--regardless of whether they marched into or couldn't talk their way out of it.In fact, the only substantive complaints are longer-than-comfortable loading times and the lack of extensive touchscreen support for the Switch edition. Given that much of the combat is tactical, and that a touchscreen works as a damned fine substitute for a mouse, the feature is an apparent omission that prevents the Switch version from being the best yet.Wasteland 2 is still a very special outing. If you haven't spent your time in this irradiated desert just yet, this is one of the best times to do so--especially since the portability of the Switch reissue lets you take the journey on long treks of your own, or as a dense RPG to curl and nestle in with, as you might with an excellent book. On such a screen, the interpersonal dramas feel a bit more intimate, the tension of sneaking your way pay this or that NPC a bit more tangible. Plus, in the Switch's handheld mode, the rather dated-looking visuals aren't so grating. All-told it's a phenomenal port and still one of the better RPGs in recent years."
606,John Wick Hex,8.0,2,"John Wick is an orchestrator of death. He efficiently uses both the tools and space around him in a fight, delicately flowing between enemies and intelligently picking them off. John Wick Hex effortlessly replicates the slick violence of the films, allowing you to embody the feared assassin in combat scenarios that are both challenging and satisfying to overcome. It also introduces a fast-paced spin on traditional turn-based action, letting you think and act like the elusive Baba Yaga while also looking as refined and controlled as he is.At the core of John Wick Hex is an overhead timeline, which records actions both you and enemies take. Each action takes a set amount of time, represented plainly in the timeline to give you a clear view of when you’re taking a shot versus when you have to dodge an incoming one, for example. After each turn, the action you’ve made plays out in real-time, only pausing if a new enemy enters your line of sight or if you take damage to let you adjust accordingly. You’re always aware of how the action is going to play out when it starts moving again, which lets you plan ahead and position yourself for your next turn.The choices you make in combat are vital, though. Sometimes an enemy might be quicker on the draw than you, forcing you to decide between potentially taking a hit or throwing your gun to stun them in time. This has its own set of consequences. If the enemy is too far, you’ve now disarmed yourself with too much ground to cover for a close-quarters takedown, or left yourself vulnerable to the surprise appearance of another foe. Each turn is a new step in a moving puzzle, rewarding careful consideration of positioning, sight lines, and resource management with a graceful flow of murder.Aside from health, you have to consider both ammunition and a resource called focus. John Wick is great with a gun, but Hex limits the number of bullets you can carry at a time to force you to experiment with new weapons that you find. Knowing how many bullets you have in the magazine before a fight helps you manage how many enemies you think you can dispatch before needing to find a new one, which in turn helps you move efficiently from one kill to the next, collecting dropped firearms in the process. It’s a satisfying balance; I constantly had to adapt to the firing speeds and effective ranges of new weapons, which in turn changed the way I advanced on or retreated from a fight.Focus governs most of your actions outside basic movement and shooting. Everything from performing an instant melee takedown to reloading your weapon requires some focus points, making it the backbone to most of your available repertoire. Although it can be replenished easily enough, finding space in a fight to do so without taking too much damage is tough, encouraging you to only bite off as much as you can chew and space your enemies out to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Your successes and failures are governed but how well you’re able to manage both ammunition and your distribution of resources, with Hex focusing less on hit percentages and random rolls and more on the choices you make and your ability to anticipate how things will play out.Levels are designed to challenge your understanding of movement and its inherent risks, too, stuffing you into long, cramped corridors laden with doors that enemies can spawn through at any point. Sight lines are obscured to keep you guessing about who's just around the corner; a reckless roll could put you in the firing line of a group of previously hidden enemies. Each step you take towards the exit of each level has to be a calculated one, taking into account acute angles of doorways and the benefits of elevation from overhead balconies.When you hit a stride with this balancing act, John Wick Hex feels like it’s almost moving in real time. Your decisions will start feeling instinctive, with moves playing out as if you’re beholden to a ticking clock. Hex is tuned to make you feel like you’re always one step ahead. Because you have a beat or two to react to new enemies before they make their moves, you'll often feel like your reaction times are split seconds ahead of them--so long as you're thinking carefully. But it’s equally unforgiving if you’re too bold. If you don’t learn how to break sight lines while moving, you’ll quickly find your timeline overwhelmed with enemy actions that you can’t address entirely. Hex is a power fantasy with the odds ever so slightly tilted in your favor, but it’s also a game that wants you to understand the fine margins that John Wick operates within during every fight.With such dynamic and engrossing combat at its center, it’s disappointing that John Wick Hex’s original story fails to live up to the same standard. It takes place well before the events of the first film--when John was the most dangerous weapon the High Table had in their employ, and before he ever met his wife--with John searching for series stalwarts Winston and Charon, reprised by Ian McShane and Lance Reddick respectively (Keanu Reeves' likeness is used in the game's stylized cartoonish aesthetic, but John Wick has no dialogue to speak of). Hex, a new villain to the series, has kidnapped the pair in an attempt to dismantle the High Table in a fit of revenge, inviting the wrath of John Wick as he ruthlessly hunts him down over a variety of locales, like neon-soaked night clubs with harsh electronic music and silent, snow-slicked forests which quickly become drenched in bright pink streaks of blood from fallen foes.While the narrative gives the game a reason to bounce from one location to the next, it never taps into the intriguing layer of lore that sits on top of the high-octane action from the films. You’ll learn nothing new about the High Table or their seedy, mysterious Continental hotels, and even less about John’s time before giving up his assassin lifestyle in pursuit of something quieter. Hex’s revenge tale also fails to establish any interesting backstory or lasting impression on the franchise, making the story feel meaningless in the grander scheme of things.It’s a disappointing thread that ties together the exceptional gameplay, which faithfully captures the feeling of being John Wick in a strategic and pulsating formula. John Wick Hex has turn-based gameplay at a pace you’ve likely not experienced before, and it intricately balances its systems to give you a sense of being an expert hitman while also making it feel earned. It’s a slick and well-oiled game that succeeds in giving you a new, engrossing way to experience John Wick and its signature brand of chaotic action."
2939,Leedmees,6.0,1,"           Leedmees is a game that's good for casual play; attempting 100 percent completion in this game is a great way to make you hate it. Using your body to solve puzzles can be fun, but pulling a muscle because you're trying to get that last impossible star is not. Leedmees sports the same $10 price tag as other Kinect games available on Xbox Live, while offering a decent amount of content and replay value. It's worth a look if you want unique Kinect content that doesn't involve minigames.  "
2398,Rush Bros,6.0,1,"            Even when it's not proving especially interesting, Rush Bros. at least makes an effort to play fair. Your DJ moves fluidly and responds to your commands with the required precision, especially when you're playing with a controller (as the game initially recommends). If a segment proves challenging, the closest checkpoint isn't usually terribly far back. Sometimes, you appear only a few pixels from the place where you last met your demise, meaning very little time is lost even when you make rookie mistakes.           "
2136,Forza Motorsport 5,9.0,2,"  Top Gear serve as entertaining guides through all manner of automotive styles and eras. It's a format made up of dozens of mini-campaigns, each focused on a specific class of vehicle, ranging from vintage touring legends to hot hatches to modern hypercars. It's a much more a la carte approach than previous Forza games: each series is unlocked from the start, lasting between one and two hours each. You're given the freedom to progress through these themed categories in any order you wish, the only limit to what you drive next being the number of credits in your virtual bank account.  Top Gear partnership that takes the form of narrated voice-overs preceding each series. Whether they're playfully mocking the third generation of Ford Mustangs or recounting the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season, Clarkson, Hammond, and May shine as automotive historians. Their entertaining yet informative prologues lend both context and humor to every category of car you choose to spend time with.   That same flair for personality can be seen in the new drivatar AI system. The idea is that each car you compete against throughout your career is modeled after a real player's driving habits, a sort of cloud-based doppelganger meant to reflect how aggressive a person is in the pack or how well they can negotiate the trickiest of chicanes. Exactly how accurate these portraits are is up for debate, but the system does succeed in filling each 16-car grid with distinct personalities, drivers whose tendencies you can never take for granted. Their mistakes are far less predictable than the vanilla AI of previous games--especially when you reduce their penchant for aggression by climbing the ladder of eight difficulty settings--making those moments you capitalize on their errors that much more rewarding. There are odd AI hiccups here and there, like when they side-swipe you in the straights for no apparent reason, but such goofs are rare and nothing that a quick tap of the rewind button can't solve. This is a game that expertly captures the bond between car and driver, improving on a world-class racing simulation with just as much human touch as technical wizardry Forza 4, already a game that carried a profound sense of environmental deja vu. But those tracks that did make the cut have received the full next-gen treatment. Classics like Laguna Seca and Silverstone are significant improvements over their prior iterations in terms of both look and feel, bristling with race day atmosphere and up-to-date tweaks to track layouts. And then there are the new circuits: the sloping forest hills of Spa-Francorchamps, the classical European streets of Prague, and the demanding ascent of Mount Panorama. These excellent additions don't remove the sting from the modest track count, but they do serve as wonderful complements to the stable of well-updated classics.  Easier to forgive is Forza 5's reduced car count. While smaller overall, this is the broadest assortment of vehicles the series has ever seen, highlighted by the introduction of open-wheel Formula One and IndyCars. Piloting a 750-horsepower Lotus E21 mere inches above the asphalt is an experience every bit as exhilarating as it is terrifying, making you feel as though any switch on that cockpit could send you rocketing into outer space. But whether you're cruising around in a Ford Focus or a McLaren P1, every car in the game's catalog looks absolutely remarkable--both in their pristine showroom forms as well as those post-race close-ups where flecks of grime litter the exterior and scratches adorn the disc brakes.  Indeed, Forza 5 has hardly forgotten its roots as a racing sim known for its staggering dedication to realism. Improved tire physics give you a better sense of your car's shifting weight as you barrel through sloped corners, while a clever implementation of the Xbox One trigger rumble delivers valuable haptic feedback about your current traction and stability levels. But as with previous games, Forza 5 is only as demanding as you want it to be. A generous collection of driving assists allows you to settle into your own personal comfort zone on the track, with rewards for ratcheting up the difficulty and penalties for overusing the rewind function.  But a steadfast dedication to racing physics is only part of the story. Forza 5 is a game brimming with audiovisual flourishes, little touches that elevate the driving experience just as much as the underlying science. The way sunlight comes flooding through your windshield as you race across the Prague circuit's cobblestone bridge, or the excellent orchestral soundtrack that makes each race feel like the climax of a James Bond movie--Forza 5 is an absolutely beautiful game full of immersive detail. And nowhere is that more visible than in the remarkable cockpit views, where intricate stitch work and high-resolution textures serve as rich palettes for the game's drastically improved lighting effects. Even the Dolby cassette deck on a '92 Golf GTi is a thing of beauty.  Forza 5 goes out of its way to ensure that every feature carried over from previous games has seen meaningful improvements. The Autovista mode that debuted in Forza 4 (renamed Forzavista here) has expanded from a handful of cars to the game's entire roster, making it easy to lose time ogling your latest purchase from every conceivable angle. Rivals mode remains an exciting means of challenging your friends' best lap times, but now it has been fully integrated into the career mode so that you're automatically presented with a new lap time to beat even as you're racing your way toward your next extravagant supercar. Even the livery editor has been expanded with new vinyls and surface materials, giving you the opportunity to defy all that is holy by designing a wood-grain Ferrari 458 Italia, or a Lexus LFA made entirely of brushed copper.  Unfortunately, I had limited access to Forza 5's multiplayer in the game's prerelease review state, with only the option to choose between a pair of hoppers for A- and S-class cars respectively. But my time competing against other players revealed a stable networking environment (thanks in some part to the game's dedicated servers, no doubt) and a lovely matchmaking system that lets you tinker around in any mode you please while it searches for an acceptable match.  All of this combined makes Forza Motorsport 5 an outstanding improvement to an already excellent racing franchise. It's far more than just a great racing sim, or a gorgeous showcase for the types of feats the Xbox One hardware is capable of. This is a game built on the romantic thrill of motorsport in all its forms, and that love for its subject matter is all but impossible to resist."
4359,Populous: The Beginning,4.0,0,"Are you looking for a game that gives you plenty of time to get sandwiches, make phone calls, and go on vacation between levels? How about a game that occasionally crashes in the middle of loading a level? If so, then Populous: The Beginning is the game for you. Populous: The Beginning is the third game in the Populous series, and it has little, if anything, in common with the previous Populous games. Here, instead of merely playing as a god and watching from above, you're cast as a shaman, and you must directly control your followers, mostly to organize them against opposing tribes. You'll also command your tribe to build various structures, including huts where they will live, training facilities where they will learn how to fight, and guard towers, which will help you establish remotes bases of operations. If this all sounds a bit like Command &amp; Conquer or Warcraft, that's because it plays more like those real-time strategy games than like the slower, more cerebral Populous and Populous II. The game takes place on a small planet, which appears in full 3D so you can rotate your view to get a better vantage point. Unfortunately, the graphics are so blocky you can never really get a clear idea of exactly what everything is. The individual troops are so small that you frequently can't even tell exactly what type of unit you're looking at. Is that a brave or a warrior? You may never know....  The game's sound is decent, but the new-agey music quickly becomes tiresome. The rest of the soundtrack is composed of the battle cries and gibberish that make up your tribe's native tongue. There is also a booming voice that speaks before every level, showing you the lay of the land and instructing you how to go about completing your objectives. It's not that Populous: The Beginning is a bad game, it's just a bad PlayStation game. The controller really isn't up to the task of commanding tons of miniscule units with any amount of precision, and the graphics are so muddy you can't discern what's going on a good portion of the time. Also, the game crashed at least once on every PlayStation we tried it on. Get the PC version, instead. It's better in every way."
1775,Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series,8.0,2,"Game of Thrones breaks you. It’s a deceptively complicated choice, a choice you second-guess for the entirety of the two-hour opening episode. You would think that making a choice between, say, saving one life and saving many lives would be simple. You have to do what’s best for the house you serve, right? But what if it’s not the best thing for you, personally? What is more important: self-preservation or your lord’s legacy? “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” So says Cersei Lannister in the HBO television series Telltale’s game is based on, which itself is based on George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. Game of Thrones makes you participate in the twisted machinations of said game of thrones in an attempt to protect the reputation and ensure the survival of your family, House Forrester. The Forresters have long served House Stark, a house that is already rapidly spiraling into bad favor when the first episode opens. This places the Forresters in an already precarious political situation, which in predictable Game of Thrones fashion, only gets worse. Thrones’ story begins just as the War of the Five Kings is heating up. Five lords all seek to claim the Iron Throne and assume kingship over Westeros. The political climate is hot with peril and tensions are strung so high that lords and handmaidens must choose every word carefully, on pain of losing their status and life if they so much as look the wrong way at someone in power. This stress hangs over everyone involved in the delicate dance of fighting for kingship, but Telltale’s Thrones perfectly communicates the anxiety by focusing on a smaller house that is not directly in the limelight. House Forrester is no House Stark in stature, but in terms of familial loyalty, duty and love, this family is very similar to the ill-fated Wardens of the North. House Forrester is still vital to Westeros, however, as the family controls the majority of the world’s Ironwood, a strain of wood that is in high demand for its durability and strength. These groves of Ironwood are just one more thing you need to keep track of as you guide the Forresters through precarious situations with other lords and ladies. You play as three members affiliated with House Forrester, and the three in question will change with each episode. Telltale’s tried-and-true branching dialogue choices are present in Game of Thrones, along with its simple analog stick shifting and button mashes to maneuver through fights. And there are quite a few fights in this first episode. Prompts appear for trigger-presses that end with the swing of a greatsword or the stab of a pitchfork. Sometimes these prompts call for frantic button mashing to escape burning debris or wrestle out of a soldier's grip. Game of Thrones is less about combat and more about verbal parlaying. The emphasis on talking is very much a Thrones thing; just as in the show and books, words carry a weight that can make or break your fate. One wrong word to Joffrey and you’re executed on the spot. A flippant comment to Littlefinger and you’re as good as ruined. Failing to curry favor with Margaery, Cersei, or any other powerful lady in court could spell doom for you when you most need help. Game of Thrones successfully recreates this panic in game form, dropping you in the middle of sticky situations that will be familiar to you if you know the source material. The most chilling of these scenes involves you having to talk your way into favor with a certain unpredictable highborn woman. Your dialogue options suggest that you can lie outright and say everything she wants to hear by feigning absolute loyalty, profess loyalty to the lady you serve and risk bringing mistrust on your head, or go all-in, defending your house and the North in exchange for what could be a horrendous punishment. This scene is the essence of what Game of Thrones tries to convey, a healthy amount of fear coupled with the responsibility to protect your family from extinction. Every decision you make matters. Everything you do has a consequence, not just for you, but for the house you belong to or the people you serve. If you a kill a man belonging to a rival house, you can bet that rival house will want vengeance. If you reveal your secret plans to another handmaiden, someone else will find out. And if you ask the wrong person to use his or her power to help you, it could not only bring misfortune onto you but onto your new ally as well, affecting your relationship. The Game of Thrones show paints pictures of a ripple effect that never stops rippling, and this same effect is an omnipresent thing in the game. It's difficult to explain without spoiling some very intricate political clockwork, but the game does an excellent job of stage-setting in a way that makes it immediately apparent every choice will haunt you later. There are a lot of small details in Iron from Ice, many brief moments and markers that you may miss, at first, due to the episode’s slow pacing. Game of Thrones starts at a slow-burn, with an opening episode that is almost entirely stage-setting for the five more episodes to come. It’s never boring, but there are a few scenes that feel a little too long with slow-moving dialogue. For example, a shouting match against a rival lord that won't take no for an answer runs in circles; he asks for what he wants, you say no, he says he won't leave without it, you offer something else, he says no, you have the option to lie to or yell at him, he goes back to his original argument. The pacing is very George R. R. Martin-esque, but in the context of a game it dissipates the momentum. However, these stretches of quieter scenes are worth it when you get to the more heart-pounding climaxes of each playable character’s tale. One of the biggest charms of Game of Thrones is being a part of major events from the show. It’s exciting (and also sometimes devastating) to fight in familiar battles or chat with well-known characters. These longtime characters are also voiced by their show actors, adding a deeper thrill to these encounters. I was tingling after completing a scene featuring the sadistic Ramsay Snow--I was on edge, my body completely tense. I didn’t realize I had been sitting completely still, barely breathing with mouth agape as I tried to tell Ramsay all the right things that would just make him go away. It’s moments like these that make you feel as though you’re right there in the show, with Ramsay Snow breathing death in your eyes and waving a dagger underneath your nose. Recreating the sense of anxiety-riddled anticipating that the show is known for is one of the better things going for Telltale’s Thrones, but the best is the Forresters themselves. Spending time with Margaery Tyrell or Tyrion Lannister is enjoyable, but whenever the action turns to these characters you instantly want them to leave. The Forresters are a heartwarming, earthy group that epitomize Telltale’s knack for creating deep, attractive characters. They, like the Starks, are in a bad place due to a poorly-dealt hand of fate, and their plight, the central story, is genuinely gut-wrenching, horrific, and real. You grow to love these characters because of the brave faces they try to put on and the doubt and pain that nearly destroy them. It’s hard to name one character who does not change in some way due to the events of Iron from Ice, and that character development is both a reflection of author George R.R. Martin’s character design influence and Telltale Game’s ability to birth beautiful broken people that you want to spend time with. You come for Tyrion and Cersei, but you stay for the Forresters. Telltale has again successfully paired itself with a franchise that knows how to wring emotion from its audience. Game of Thrones is off to a slow but not uneventful start, with an almost unfairly large heap of teases and promises for the next episode. The pacing is true to its source material--slow, taking its own time--but the payoff for major scenes is worth wading through. If the show makes you scream, the game will make you scream, because it’s difficult not to get wrapped up in the struggle to serve and hold up your house. It’s a game about family told in perhaps the most un-family-friendly environment in fantasy fiction, and in a way that will leave you sick with delight and sadness as the credits roll."
2225,NBA 2K14,8.0,2,"    The improved controls are paired with diverse animations that make anything that could happen on an NBA court seem possible. Fouls happen because of how you and your opponent are positioned, so you know when you're smartly gambling for a steal and when you're just being stupid. Subtle body movements are important in creating (or eliminating) space between two players, and you usually feel in complete control of how things play out. Blocks are now a formidable weapon for a long-armed big man. Driving point guards can't expect to glide effortlessly to the hoop for free layups. If you're just trying to overpower your opponent, you're going to lose. You need finesse to get open shots, which makes you learn the intricacies of your players' skill sets and plan offensive sets accordingly.  NBA 2K11 that let you fill Michael Jordan's shoes, Path to Greatness doesn't require you to reach a specific stat line to progress. Because you need only win to proceed, you can play your way, which is a lot of fun given LeBron's wide assortment of talents. More fanfic than historical document, this mode is a good way to explore The King's options. And who knows, maybe he will end up back in Cleveland some day… Despite the occasional technical missteps, NBA 2K14 is a great experience that deftly captures the essence of what makes the NBA so appealing. Nothing could perfectly replicate reality, but 2K14 has almost as much personality, and gives you the freedom to perform how you wish. With lifelike animations, realistic player models, and an assortment of moves that would make even Dwyane Wade blush, NBA 2K14 further blurs the line between the real game and its digital equivalent."
3325,The Fight: Lights Out,5.0,1,"      Watching your in-game avatar mimic your movements closely is initially quite impressive, and The Fight's basic controls are extremely intuitive. Want to throw a punch? Just punch forward with your fist. How about an uppercut? Then swing your fist in an upward arc. Want to block an attack? Just hold up your arms with the Move controllers in hand to ward off the blow. The Fight also takes velocity into account, meaning that you have to put some heft behind your strikes to get past an opponent's guard and do real damage. Simply swatting at the screen or ineffectually jabbing won't do much--you have to punch like you mean it, which results in a pretty hefty workout that's bound to leave you puffed and sweating after a few fights. The game also uses the PlayStation Eye camera for head tracking, which allows you to bob, duck, and weave your head to avoid hits. When it sticks to the basics, The Fight can be fun. Throwing jabs, haymakers, and uppercuts and generally trying to find defensive weak points in an opponent is engaging, and there's quite a bit of simplistic joy in watching your foe's head snap back after you deliver a vicious and well-timed straight fist.       This brutal glee is short-lived, though, with The Fight tangling itself up in the ropes when it comes to any of its more complex moves. These moves--which you earn as you beat opponents in the game's lengthy single-player campaign--are performed by holding down the trigger on one (or both) of the Move controllers and moving your arms in a specific motion. Elbows, for example, are done by holding the trigger and thrusting one Move forward, while backhands are done by holding the trigger and sweeping your hand in a backwards motion in front of you. The game will often mix up commands, coming out with a backhand when you're trying to do an elbow hook, or will even fail to register inputs completely, such as with a windmill punch that never seems to work. These special moves can be useful in getting past some of the tougher opponents, so it's frustrating when they don't work on a regular basis. But it's not just special moves that The Fight gets wrong. The game regularly loses track of your movements, forcing plenty of recalibrations in between bouts. Head tracking is easily lost as well and often won't work if the game deems your backing wall too bright or dark. Even with a ""mini"" calibration taking place before each fight, the game often gets it completely wrong, starting the match with your fighter's arms held up high in what looks like a premature celebratory gesture.     While it's possible to play through the game by sticking to basic punches and jabs, it's extremely repetitive and dull (as well as a good deal tougher), giving you little incentive to get back into the arena past the first few rounds. The Fight's story, too, does nothing to hook you in. In fact, there's no explanation as to who you are or why you're competing in a series of potentially deadly illegal fighting tournaments to begin with. There's a basic character editor for changing the appearance of your pugilist, and you can also improve his stats by working out in the gym (that is, perform some Move-based exercises such as punching a speed bag or sparring), but that's the limit to your character's depth. Your opponents, too, have little personality, let alone any real ties to your character to explain why you need to beat on them so bad. The only bright spark is ex-con-turned-actor Danny Trejo, who makes an entertaining appearance as your in-game mentor and tutor. Trejo's main job is to show you how to fight using the Move controllers, although this comes with the sad realization that if a tough guy like Trejo can't look tough when pretending to fight with two glowing Moves, there's very little chance that you won't look ridiculous busting out the same motions.     With more than 100 fights against colorfully named characters like the Violator or the Preacher, there's a lot of single-player content to be found in The Fight. This brawler also goes online, with the option to play ranked or public matches and even to watch and bet in-game currency on other players' bouts. Fighting online proved to be stable and lag-free, although finding ranked matches during testing proved to be tough. The online provides much the same experience as offline (that is, uneven), but it's a little worse because there's no way to recalibrate mid-match should the controls go awry.     "
4515,Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs!,4.0,0,"If Zoboomafoo is successful at doing one thing, it's working as an advertisement for the children's TV show on PBS--because as a game it offers very little entertainment. At the beginning of the game, you find out that it's Lemur Day at Animal Junction, and the resident lemur, Zoboo, wants to celebrate with some of his animal friends. However, the Kratt brothers aren't around to help out, so Zoboo must provide food for the party by gathering snacks from different parts of the world. In the process of searching for the party food, you'll learn about the various animals that have visited Animal Junction in the past, as well as the animals found within each level.    It's an easy task, but Zoboo's snack hunt may ultimately prove to be a frustrating experience for its intended audience. Part of the problem is Zoboo's touchy control makes it difficult to avoid bodies of water and native animals, both of which can deplete the amount of snacks you've collected. Conversely, when using Zoboo's leaping (or running) ability, the control becomes sluggish, making it even more difficult to perform basic actions, such as jumping or climbing. The overhead perspective seems to compound the control problems, as it's difficult to tell where Zoboo is capable of jumping to. This is especially problematic when Zoboo is trapped in a river and there's no obvious piece of land for him to jump on to.    Any problems in the control scheme are overshadowed by the fundamental flaws in Zoboo's snack hunt. Whenever you make contact with one of the native animals--which you learn about as you progress through the stage--or fall into water, one snack piece is taken from your inventory. Fortunately, it reappears wherever you collected the last snack. But if you lose more than one snack at a time, it's nearly impossible to retrieve them in timely manner, because it's so easy to lose track of where you collected the last few snacks. You often have to go back to the beginning of the level and retrace your steps over and over, especially when you've reached the exit but haven't collected enough snacks. Granted, you only have to collect 25 of the 50 snacks in each level to complete it successfully, so you can take the easy way out, but by doing so, you dramatically reduce the replay value of the game--though, there really isn't any to begin with.   Zoboo does have a sniffing skill that might help you find where the remaining snacks are, but you have to be so close to the snack to begin with that no amount of sniffing will do any good. In addition, there are some special animal friends located in each stage that can help you reach previously unattainable snacks, but because of the touchy controls, some of the special animals in later levels are a chore to use.    While there are plenty of spotty moments, Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs isn't a complete loss. The graphics don't suffer from any particular problems. Most of the animals are easily identifiable, and the environments are accurate representations of their different types of habitats. With the exception of in the arctic stage, the music is subtle and serves as a complement to the different stages, but it's nothing that will make you take notice.    Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs' inconsistent control and frustrating gameplay make it difficult to recommend, even for a younger audience. Its only redeeming quality is that it provides information on the animals that visit Animal Junction and the animals that Zoboo encounters on his journey, which can range from butterflies to arctic foxes. But in the end, you're probably better off just watching the television show--you'll get the same kind of facts with much less frustration."
734,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,9.0,2,"This kind of accountability is extended in multiple directions with Gathering Storm, the second major expansion for Civ VI. Through the institution of a World Congress, Gathering Storm lets leaders reward and punish each other for certain actions, allow them to pass sweeping resolutions that affect every civilization, and ultimately secure their diplomatic favor. And with its new World Climate system, Gathering Storm makes you accountable to the world itself by hitting you--sometimes painfully hard--with the calamitous consequences of exploiting the map's rich resources.Your path to victory in Civ VI was predictable once you'd established the foundation of your empire by the Modern Era, but the new World Congress and World Climate systems add enough dynamism to keep you working right up to the new Future Era. Gathering Storm encourages you to “play the map,"" taking advantage of the surrounding resources, and then adapt the repercussions of your decisions reflected on that map. As an expansion focused on consequences, however, it can take some time for the new stuff to make its presence felt.The World Climate system is the most meaningful change, but it doesn't really kick in until you've started extracting strategic resources like coal and oil. Early on you'll encounter floods, hurricanes, blizzards, and endure the odd drought or volcanic eruption. These weather events pass in a couple of turns, potentially reducing your population, injuring units and pillaging improvements, but they can also fertilize tiles to reward you with greater yields in future.But weather is not climate. Once you start burning coal and oil to fuel both the power plants in your industrial districts and the battleships and tanks that comprise your military force, you start pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. As those emissions rise, tallied by the new World Climate report that tracks the cumulative contributions of each civ and resource, the world will progress through up to seven phases of climate change. Sea levels will rise, at first flooding coastal tiles and eventually leaving many of them completely underwater. Weather events will increase in both frequency and severity, simultaneously desiccating your farmlands through drought and ravaging your cities with tornadoes.The choices you're forced to make here are difficult and meaningful. Resources like coal and oil are powerful and refusing to exploit them will cede an immediate advantage to any rival. Through the Industrial and Modern Eras they fuel the most effective units in your navy and army. Do you really want to rely on defending your homeland with frigates while the enemy has ironclads? Further, consumable fuel resources are the first ways you're able to power your cities. A concept debuting in Gathering Storm, powering a city--say, via a coal power plant--boosts the yields of various districts and buildings. Can you really afford to let your research labs and stock exchanges sit idle while your coal-guzzling neighbor is sprinting ahead in the science race?Later you're able to develop methods of harvesting renewable energy resources such as wind and solar farms, but by the time you're able to deploy them, you may find yourself lagging too far behind a less eco-friendly rival or, worse, suffering the consequences of irreversible damage to the planet. Helping to mitigate such destruction and preserving the natural environment will slow down the effects of climate change. This forces new, perplexing early game decisions. Chopping down that nearby rainforest will give a quick boost to producing a settler, but leaving it untouched may mean future settlers will live to see a world that still has air to breathe. Before Gathering Storm, this wasn't a choice--you chopped for the short-term gain because there were no long-term consequences. Now, every decision is purposeful. Now, every tile in your empire is asking: ""Are you sure you want to do that?""The World Congress is slightly less successful at providing new and meaningful choices than the World Climate system. What it does, though, is make you far more aware of what other leaders are up to. Once the congress convenes, from the Medieval Era onwards, you'll find yourself voting on various resolutions every 30 turns. You might be asked to vote on boosting or banning certain types of great people, or whether trade routes to particular civs or city-states should receive bonuses. You don't just get one vote; instead, you can spend a new form of currency called Diplomatic Favor to vote as many times as you can afford. Favors can also be traded with other leaders, just like any resource, meaning diplomatic players will need to give away valuable luxuries or strategic resources in order to fully exert their influence on the World Congress.In theory, these resolutions should enable the diplomatic player to tip the scales in their favor. In practice, though, their effects aren't transformative. You might get an extra trade route here, a slightly slower Great Engineer there, but nothing that feels game-changing. The randomness doesn't help--if you could propose a resolution rather than merely voting on the ones that pop up that would provide a better return on the investment.More compelling are the choices to be made around actually pursuing the new Diplomatic Victory, awarded to the leader who first reaches 10 Diplomatic Victory points. You're still essentially voting your way to the top, but you're also competing with other leaders to send the most aid to another civ recently devastated by floods, for instance, or to generate the most great people points to win the Nobel Prize. Diplomatic Favor is also earned via alliances with other civs and becoming the suzerain of a city-state, so the Diplomatic Victory is genuinely a case of demonstrating you can lead the world.These are the two biggest new features in this add-on, but Gathering Storm also includes countless smaller tweaks that in combination with the above make it an essential purchase for Civ VI fans. There are new World Wonders to build, such as the Great Bath or the University Sankore. There are new Natural Wonders, new military units to fill in the gaps between eras, and nine new leaders, including the series' first-ever dual-nationality leader (Eleanor of Aquitaine can represent either England or France).Thoughtfully, the new leaders are balanced between those that are clearly geared towards Gathering Storm's prominent additions--Kristina of Sweden is all about winning diplomatic favor while the unique abilities of Kupe, the Maori leader, incentivize leaving untouched as much of the natural world as possible--and those who embrace some previously overlooked facet of the game. In the latter camp, Matthias Corvinus heads a Hungarian empire whose military force is best composed of units levied from allied city-states, while in the Inca, lead by Pachacuti, we finally have a civ that wants lots of mountain tiles throughout its lands.Gathering Storm is overall a great expansion, ushering in two significant new systems that work hand in hand to deepen the experience. The embellished diplomatic options extend the range of interactions with other leaders, allowing you to work cooperatively towards common goals or pull the strings to your advantage behind the scenes. While the introduction of climate change delivers new strategic choices whose consequences resonate ever-more-loudly as you advance throughout the eras. It isn't simply more Civ, it's a whole new way to play Civ."
4812,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,3.0,0,"  It's no secret that games based on movies often get a bad rap. It's also no secret that games based on movies that are based on comic book characters tend to be among the worst offenders when it comes to portraying their source material. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Wii does nothing to buck that trend. Every aspect of the game is categorically bad; the story is tough to follow, the graphics are lousy, and the gameplay is so contrived and repetitive that it's unlikely anyone will garner much enjoyment from the game, no matter how low their standards are for being entertained.        Fantastic Four is supposedly based on the movie, but it takes several liberties with the story--so you're essentially getting a new, mostly lame tale. There are cutscenes before each level, but much of the plot is conveyed through boxes with talking heads and text that pops up while you play, so it's particularly difficult to understand just what is happening if you haven't seen the movie. Of course, if you have seen the movie you might find yourself wondering what the heck is going on, since Galactus is nowhere to be found.     FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer on the Wii and PS2 is a standard beat-'em-up that is somehow more basic than it was on the 360 and PS3--and much worse, too. You can play alone and switch between characters by pressing the D pad, or you and up to three friends can play together on a single system. You'll play as Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Thing, and Human Torch as they brawl their way through locations such as the Skrull lair, the Himalayas, and Shanghai. The locations may be exotic, but the mission objectives certainly aren't. You'll spend most of your time fighting seemingly endless hordes of enemies so you can activate a bridge, so you can deactivate lasers, so you can destroy a door, so you can get to an elevator, so you can do it all over again. The number of times that you walk into a room only to have the door behind you close and dozens of enemies appear are countless.      It's almost comical how repetitive the levels are--at least, it would be if they weren't so long. There are checkpoints here and there, but they're spread far apart, so if you die you're doing it all again. Fortunately, you probably won't ever die (unless you fall asleep). When characters die, they just vanish for 30 seconds or so and then reappear. As long as you make sure not everyone dies at the same time you can beat every single boss and enemy in the game by standing there and punching them; or you can go to the side of the room and toss fireballs. If that's too much work, you can literally put the controller down and watch your brain-dead, CPU-controlled partners fight the brain-dead bad guys. Yes, it's possible to beat entire rooms without even touching your controller. If you get tired of what is supposed to pass for action here you're going to have to make it to the end of a level before you quit, because that's the only place you can save your game.      All the characters have basic strong and weak attacks, and if you mix up your attacks you can string together combos. Of course, each person has special powers that you'll need to use from time to time. Invisible Woman can shoot energy waves and turn invisible; Mr. Fantastic can stretch and spin around to hit multiple enemies at the same time; The Thing can lift objects and damage bad guys by pounding the ground; and Human Torch can toss fireballs and shoot fire, and uh, shoot fire in another not-so-different way. Unfortunately, the game does little to take advantage of these superpowers. Human Torch can zoom around in the movies, but here he can barely get off the ground. The Thing can smash his way through a few walls here and there, but most items in the game are impervious to his strength. Mr. Fantastic is able to swing around wildly and hit lots of guys, but not much else, and Invisible Woman is all around pretty worthless.     On the PlayStation 2 special moves are done by holding down or double-tapping face buttons. On the Wii they're performed by holding buttons and moving, waving, or twisting the remote and/or Nunchuk. Both methods feel unresponsive and are difficult to perform when you're in a crowd, which of course is when you need them. You'll earn experience points and gain new attacks as you wail on bad guys, but none of this really matters. All you need to do to get through the game is pound the attack button and defeat thousands of mindless bad guys until the credits roll, or, more likely, until you turn the game off in disgust. The gameplay is absolutely mind-numbing, and other than the fact that it is technically playable, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. While it may feel endless, Fantastic Four is a short game that can be beaten in around six hours. The typical assortment of extra costumes and artwork can be unlocked by finding tokens hidden in each level, but if you're somehow able to force yourself to finish the game, there's little incentive to play through again.         Fantastic Four's visuals are just as bland as its gameplay, though there are at least some decent lighting and particle effects. It's too bad these effects kill the frame rate. Most rooms and areas are barren and look nearly identical to one another. This makes it hard to figure out where you're going and where you've been--a problem, given all the backtracking you'll be doing. The enemies you'll be fighting are small and lack detail. There's little variety to their looks, so you'll be fighting the same few guys over and over again. The Fantastic Four don't look too hot themselves, and it's difficult to keep track of where each character is when the action ramps up. The camera shows the action from an almost isometric perspective and it can't be moved. This means you'll spend a lot of your time getting hit by enemies that aren't even onscreen. All the characters are voiced by sound-alikes who do a respectable job in spite of the amateurish script. The sound effects and music aren't much to get excited about, either.     Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a failure on every level. The combat is agonizingly tedious, and the objectives are cliché and repetitive. As a movie tie-in it does a poor job of following the movie, and as a game...it's insidious.     "
2825,Minecraft,8.0,2,"               Does the game really benefit from an ending? Not so much, but it offers up a goal for those that feel they need one. However, the fact that there even is an ending to strive for isn't clear from the get-go because the introduction to the gameworld is such an abrupt one that's devoid of story or direction. Other recent additions to the game leading up to the game's official launch--like human villages populated by mindless non-player characters that currently serve no purpose and a bare-bones experience system that weakly ties into weapon enchantments--feel like interesting ideas that lack follow-through in their implementation.

4710,Lego Rock Raiders,3.0,0,"Go into any young boy's toy chest and you're likely to find some Lego pieces in there somewhere. Like the Erector Set and Lincoln Logs, Legos have stood the test of time as a toy that generation after generation of young bucks can enjoy. This would usually provide an easy way for a company producing video games to make some loot, but with Lego Rock Raiders, this might not be the case. Somewhere in the transition from drawing board to television screen, something has gone awry.   In Lego Rock Raiders, you play as one of several Lego characters instructed to mine an alien planet for precious energy crystals and ore. As you might expect, the indigenous creatures aren't too keen on the idea of giving up their planet's goods to plastic men with black dots for eyes. As one of the several Rock Raiders, it's your job to mine the rock on the planet for the energy crystals and ore or, in some cases, to rescue the other Raiders who may have pitifully found themselves in trouble. There is a two-player mode available for up to six levels, but as the instruction manual puts it, they are designed ""just for fun.""    The first few minutes playing Rock Raiders makes the game seem like it's going to be an endless search to find the few places where your imbecile drill can work. Once you begin to use the radar, the loose rock appears a brighter green than the rest of the level, and any difficulty the game may have had quickly jumps on the next train to Easyville. The level design isn't exactly mystifying. As each of the 18 linear levels begins, you start with a simple drill that will destroy the loose rock. As you progress through the level, you find more-powerful tools that allow you to turn the medium and hard rock into rubble. When dealing with solid rock, you can use dynamite to blast open the way through. As you finish each level, you are awarded a medal based on your performance, and you may go back to replay previous levels in attempts at a golden glory. Take note, this is not recommended.   While using a hand drill falls just shy of buffoonery, the vehicles are by far the shining stars in the Lego Rock Raiders sky. If you collect enough ore, the usually tucked-away LMS Explorer located in every level can be used to construct anything from an armored tanker that ejects menacing laser blasts, to a massive double-bladed carrier chopper. While every vehicle controls identically whether land-based or airborne, each one is able to either traverse an area that was previously inaccessible or destroy once-thought-immovable rock masses. Vehicle control is so erratic in one particular vehicle that you become dizzy from the spinning. Controlling the jumping of your Rock Raider while on foot is stupefying though not required all that often. There aren't exactly swarms of enemies dashing on; the biggest obstacle to overcome is maintaining control around dangerous areas. This is about the only way you will ever die. The oft-repeated enemies will rush at you and bump you, but there's so much health lying around that it never becomes an issue.   Lego Rock Raiders' visuals also fail to impress; we're talking first-generation PlayStation graphics. Every level looks almost identical to the one before, and if it weren't for the rock radar, playing this game would be akin to reconstructive knee surgery. The explosions are popular with the people for a little while, but by the eighth or ninth level, their allure quickly fades. This too can be said of the monotonous gameplay. Some of the vehicles are fairly impressive but are not worth taking the time to experience the rest of the game. Not helping matters, the loading time for each level clocked in at a hefty half-minute. Considering how little texture swapping is taking place, this isn't a good thing. The sound is adequate minus the two tracks that are obnoxiously repeated as the sounds of the explosions get the woofers shaking.   When it's all said and done, the small things that are done right are far outweighed by the multitude of those done wrong. The only motivation to continue playing Lego Rock Raiders is to see the next portion of a decent FMV sequence that only serves as a reminder of how much better the game could have been."
3797,The King of Fighters XII,5.0,1,"  The King of Fighters series has offered team-based 2D fighting game competition, in arcades and on multiple console and handheld platforms, for 15 years. But other than the forgettable Maximum Impact series (which used 3D graphics) and a few obscure handheld versions, the series has generally reused the same 2D ""sprite"" art assets for its characters year after year. Until now. The King of Fighters XII offers a big visual overhaul that introduces huge new character sprites, along with brand-new background stages and music to go with generally solid fighting game action. But in exchange for the new paint job, the console versions of the game come stripped down with limited play modes, a thinner character roster than usual, and serious online problems.         KOFXII is a one-on-one fighting game that lets you choose a team of three different characters to challenge your opponent's team of three, and the game's fundamental fighting mechanics are pretty sound. The game's roster has a good variety of different abilities, strategies, and combination attacks, and the pace is good and brisk--about as fast as that of more recent games in the series. The characters also seem balanced--a team of any three characters has a good chance of beating pretty much any other team of three. KOFXII even has some new gameplay additions that really change the way matches are played, such as the new-and-improved knockdown attacks, which set up new offensive possibilities. There's also more emphasis on advanced ""juggle"" attacks than in previous games in the series--there are more opportunities to knock your opponents skyward and then hammer on them before they hit the ground, so skilled players have new ways to punish their opponents' mistakes.     The last new gameplay feature is the ""critical counter"" system, which rewards your well-placed counterattack by briefly stunning your opponents, opening them up to a huge offensive flurry. It sounds interesting in theory, but in practice, it tends to encourage both players to be a lot more conservative because nobody wants to open himself up to a critical counter followed by a giant knuckle sandwich. Also, even though the game has several of the gameplay accoutrements of the more recent games, such as the ability to roll forward and backward, as well as multiple jump levels, there's only one level of your character's ""power meter"" to perform only one level of superattack--the spectacular hyper and leader attacks of recent years are gone.        If you can accept KOFXII on just those features, you're all set to enjoy what the game has to offer. But if you've played any recent games in the series, you'll be disappointed by the relatively small character roster. For many years now, the KOF series has offered character rosters with more than 30 characters; this time around, you get only 22. This includes the addition of two forgettable console-exclusive characters, Mature and Elizabeth, as well as the conspicuous absence of SNK's iconic female ninja/geisha girl, Mai Shiranui. To be fair, KOF XII's all-new art assets make the game something of a restarting point for the series--but if you're a longtime fan, you'll still probably find yourself wishing the game hadn't cut this or that character you used to play.     And a few characters have actually been revamped with interesting new fighting styles, such as the devilishly debonair Iori Yagami, whose old abilities have been replaced by close-range, slashing attacks. However, most of the other characters have lost the newer tricks and fighting maneuvers they acquired in recent editions of the series. In some cases, they have the move sets and abilities of much older versions of their characters, such as Kyo Kusanagi, who plays like his KOF '95 version.      Still, the character roster is pretty well rounded and has most of the popular characters from the series, so if you're a KOF fan, you can probably find at least one team you'll like. You will have more trouble with the game's online multiplayer, which was patched on day one of the PlayStation 3 version's retail release (the Xbox 360 patch has not yet been released). Both versions still suffer from lag--in some cases, extremely bad lag. This is annoying for any fighting game, but it's a bigger problem for KOFXII because the critical counter attacks (which can be hugely damaging) require specific timing to pull off, and that timing gets completely thrown in a match that lags. KOFXII's online play is buried in unintuitive menus that make it hard to find players with decent connections, and for some bizarre reason, you can't quit out of Spectator mode to find another game. So sometimes, you'll find yourself stuck watching other people's matches.     Because the online play is such a bad experience, you might think you can get by with offline play, at least until the problems are all patched out. Unfortunately, KOFXII doesn't have much to do offline. There's a single-player Arcade mode (which is actually a Time Trial mode) that lets you fight five matches against other in-game characters but then immediately ends because there's no boss character. There's also an offline Versus mode that lets you challenge the person sitting next to you, and a Training mode that lets you practice on a dummy character. And there's a picture gallery where you can unlock some character art. That's it. There's no Story mode, no Challenge mode (like the robust Challenge mode of KOFXI for the PlayStation 2), and no Survivor mode--a staple of home KOF versions for the past 10 years.        Even though KOFXII's new sprites and backgrounds are big, vibrant, and well animated, when you sit down to play the game for a bit, you'll find that the soundtrack is mostly unexciting ambient music and background noises. Sitting down longer with the game will probably make you yearn for more offline modes or your favorite KOF characters that didn't make the cut. And trying to play the game online--at least at the time of this writing--will probably make you want to stick to playing the game offline, with friends who are sitting next to you. If you're lucky enough to have an in-house fighting game competition, you're probably in the best position to enjoy KOFXII because despite the thin roster and gameplay changes, the game still offers a decent head-to-head experience with bona fide new gameplay features and some overhauled characters with interesting new abilities. If you're not, you might have trouble justifying the decision to pick up this game when there are other excellent 2D fighting games out there with stronger online multiplayer, more characters, and more offline content.     "
4699,Rebels: Prison Escape,3.0,0," Not to put too fine a point on it, but Rebels: Prison Escape is a poor man's Commandos. Like the Commandos series and its imitators (games such as Desperados and Star Trek Away Team), Rebels is a real-time game where you control a handful of specialist characters who have to outwit guards with a lot of stealth and a little action. If you can live with the fact that Rebels is derivative and often laughably illogical, it can be good fun because it does a number of things right. Nevertheless, the game is almost impossible to recommend because it's hamstrung by massive technical problems.      Rebels includes a story, but it's really just a throwaway. In some unspecified land and time, the evil dictator Friedrich has taken power. A resistance movement known as A.R.M., the Alliance of Rebel Movements, is preparing to fight back against Friedrich and his thugs, but five of A.R.M.'s chief operatives are caught while making their plans. If this all sounds simplistic and silly, that's because it is; none of it is fleshed out in any detail, and it's really only a way to tack a story onto a game about prison breaks.    Over the course of six levels, you lead the five A.R.M. leaders singly or in groups as they try to escape various prisons scattered across the land. Each character has his or her own special abilities that you'll need to master to beat the game. Blake is the strongman who can knock out guards, drag their bodies away, feign death, and force doors open with a crowbar. He's also the marksman of the group. Jeffrey is the engineer who can pick locks, set traps, and wield various firearms. Alicia is the obligatory seductress who can move quickly, hide in shadows, and strangle enemies. Jonah is a shaman who hypnotizes enemies with voodoo or shoots them with poison darts from his blowgun. Alexandro is an illusionist who can disguise himself, imitate sounds, and create blinding flashes to disorient guards. Like almost everything in Rebels, you'll just have to take these abilities on faith. Why, for example, can Alicia strangle enemies, but the other characters can't?   Nonsense in the service of gameplay is one of the defining traits of Rebels. As in other games of this type, you can toggle line-of-sight cones on and off for all the enemies. This is a necessary feature since a major part of the game is timing precisely when and where to move while avoiding the roving guards. Oddly, though, some of the guards' view cones are so short that they seem to suffer from massive myopia; eyeglasses apparently aren't part of Friedrich's health plan for henchmen. To keep the gameplay going, guards have other built-in oddities. If one guard sees another one knocked out, he'll sound the alarm, but you can literally knock out the same lone guard repeatedly throughout the course of a mission, and he won't get the least bit suspicious but will just resume his duties each time he regains consciousness. For that matter, strongman Blake can kill guards who fall for his feigned death trick, but he can't simply break the necks of guards he knocks out with a punch, nor can he grab their weapons while they're unconscious.   The various tasks you perform during each mission tend to be equally arbitrary or contrived. A lot of them are ""FedEx"" tasks where you have to talk to prisoner X, who tells you to go find item Y and give it to prisoner Z, and so on down the line. If you can take all this at face value, it can be entertaining. Rebels rewards careful study of the detailed environments and guards' behavior, and it's entertaining to plan the perfect route past a bunch of henchmen and see it pay off. While many games of this genre are brutally difficult, Rebels tends to be challenging without overdoing it, and you can freely rotate and zoom the camera and issue commands while paused to make your life easier. That said, you'll still need to engage in lots of trail and error, but the game lets you quick-save and load whenever you want, so if you're patient, it's not much of a problem.   The maps are pretty well laid out and pleasant looking, though from a technical standpoint, the graphics are merely serviceable, and the in-mission cutscenes look downright nasty, with characters that appear blocky and cartoony in the worst sense. The audio also gets the job done but without being anything memorable. Most all the voice-overs could have been done better. Some sound effects and music tracks draw you into the action, but just as many are merely humdrum.       Still, the presentation works overall, and the gameplay can be challenging and rewarding if you can live with its many quirks. Unfortunately, Rebels suffers from some huge problems, some of which can make the game literally unplayable. Replay value is limited since the game includes only six levels that essentially play the same way each time, and there are no optional difficulty settings. Worse still, major technical problems badly mar Rebels. The camera tends to jerk wildly when you rotate it, making it hard to align it where you want it. The interface is extremely sluggish: You often have to issue commands multiple times for them to register. That frustrating sluggishness is a major drawback in a game about careful timing. The biggest problem is that, along with suffering from a variety of bugs, Rebels has a tendency to crash to the desktop, requiring you to reboot the game and sit through long load times to pick up where you left off--assuming you had saved recently. You'll end up fearing crashes far more than the game's guards. Sometimes the game can lock your system up entirely. It's really a shame that Rebels: Prison Escape is so buggy. When it's working, it isn't half bad, but you should never have to say ""when it's working"" about a game you've paid good money for. "
3246,DC Universe Online,7.0,2,"   City of Heroes, City of Villains, and Champions Online. If you've played one of them, you might be disappointed that at least initially, DC Universe Online doesn't offer the cosmetic flexibility for which those other superhero-themed games are so well known. That isn't to say that the character creation isn't robust, though you might have your imagination somewhat stifled. Of course, DC Universe Online instantly stands out by having heroes and villains alike share the same world. Once you tailor your creation to your liking, you select a weapon (if you want to play with other weapons, don't despair; your options expand later); choose a basic power set (gadgets, ice, fire, and so on); and choose one of three available mentors, such as Lex Luthor if you're a villain, or Wonder Woman, if you're a hero.      Fortunately, if you are disappointed by the initial creation options, you aren't stuck with this vision of your hero or villain forever. You earn and buy new gear as you play, but equipping a new cape doesn't mean you have to change your physical appearance. You can equip that cape for its improved stats without removing your demonic wings if they're more consistent with your overall look. In your main headquarters (the Hall of Doom for villains; the Justice League of America Watchtower for heroes), you can purchase additional cosmetic items, and when you hit on a look you really like, you can lock the entire costume--or just individual aspects of it.        After character creation, you are treated to DC Universe Online's fine tutorial, which does a great job of explaining why the world is burgeoning with superpowered individuals and demonstrating just how different the game's combat is from other online role-playing games. This is an action game in online role-playing form. When you press a button on your controller or mouse, you swing your blade, shoot your bow, or fire your rifle. There is the slightest amount of latency between your actions and the ones onscreen, but it's not enough to diminish the immediacy of battle. In most MMOGs, your key press doesn't necessarily translate to immediate contact between your weapon and your foe. DCUO's directness makes it fun for almost anyone from the get-go and a refreshing change of pace from typical entries in the genre. Superpowers are limited by your power bar (RPG vets might think of this as their mana pool.) Weapon skills, on the other hand, can be strung together with abandon, whether that means whipping your staff around like an overly enthusiastic drum major or leaping backward while you fire your dual pistols as if you're auditioning for a John Woo film.      Fluid combat animations, sparkling visual effects, and the combat's general responsiveness keep DCUO fun for quite a while, though it loses some of its luster over time. As you level up, you spend points on new combos, which not only make you more effective in combat, but also make battles more visually appealing. Nevertheless, the button presses/mouse clicks required to pull off grandiose moves aren't complex, and some attacks are effective enough to repeat over and over without throwing in too many variants--particularly when those reliable combos result in stuns or other such effects. A main drawback to the combat is the targeting. You can't choose your target--only hit the auto-target button and hope for the best. In the early going, this isn't such a big deal. In endgame raid dungeons filled with foes, on the other hand, it's too easy to select the wrong target and pull a group of enemies you'd rather have left alone--especially when the action gets really hectic and your view is obscured by bright flames and jolts of lightning.      Guild Wars, where individuals and groups could exploit their tactical potential with interesting, varied skill sets. And in the same way, playing with your loadouts in DCUO might reveal effective combinations that make you a more helpful teammate. It's too bad that the result summaries that appear at the end of certain player-versus-player matches and group dungeons don't recognize the hard work of those playing a controller role or supporting their team in other ways. (Only healing and damage stats are revealed.)      You can spend some in-game cash and ""respec"" your character--that is, reset your powers and skills and allocate your points elsewhere. But you stop earning experience (and thus, fancy new abilities) once you reach level 30, and unfortunately, you encounter that ceiling very quickly. You could conceivably reach that point after only a few days of play, and even playing casually it might only take a week. The downsides to reaching the level cap so quickly are perhaps obvious to longtime MMOG veterans: a diminished sense of progression and the tedium that arises when exploring familiar dungeons and PVP arenas many times over. And, you can't ease any tedium by exploring the various diversions you might expect to find in an online RPG, such as crafting or a player auction house.       The upside to the compressed leveling curve is that you never encounter content gaps in which you have to search for things to do or grind until you reach the point where new missions become available. Missions come to you fast and furious from the talking-head heroes and villains anxious to push you toward your next task. Or, you might receive assignments from various non-player characters strewn about the cities and elsewhere. Almost all of these characters are fully voiced, many of them rather well. Mark Hamill does an excellent job as The Joker, as he so often does in other games and on television. The mentors all sound quite good, as do a few other lesser heroes and villains. Other voice-overs sound as if they were performed by the local junior high drama club and lack the tongue-in-cheek comic timing of the better performances. The beautiful comic-book cutscenes that conclude instanced story missions and other missions, on the other hand, are consistently superb. Some are funny; others are legitimately moving. But all of them are gorgeously detailed and colored, and they're animated as if multiple cels were layered on top of each other.        The missions themselves aren't as vibrant as the scenes that close them. Kill a bunch of these things and interact with some of these other things is usually the extent of what you do, sometimes pausing to carry this thing over to that glowing spot. These copy-paste objectives can get old, though the mission voice-overs do provide an interesting context to some of these tasks. Villainous objectives are particularly enjoyable, as they often entail doing some horrible thing to an innocent bystander. These mission chains end with the aforementioned instances, where you get a chance to fight alongside a famed hero or villain--or beat up on one. These instances are usually more varied than your other tasks. For example, you might need to destroy computer terminals before Supergirl can utilize them. For even more mission variety, you can join other players in group instances called alerts. Alerts are longer--and more spacious--than story instances and might have you (for example) beating up on HIVE drones, taking down their mothership, and then facing a boss that may not be all that challenging but nevertheless takes a long time to defeat.      PVP arenas and group dungeons send you to a few iconic locales, such as the batcave and Bludhaven, though you will spend the majority of your time in DCUO's two main cities: Gotham City and Metropolis. Missions send you from one hot spot to another in either of these two urban centers at a slick pace, and you won't find any wondrous new vistas when exploring the nooks and crannies. Yet there is a good reason to keep a keen eye on your surroundings. Orbs dot the landscape, and investigating them unlocks little bits of backstory and other narrative scraps to collect. When you complete a themed collection, you earn new loot. There is another good reason to pay close attention during your travels, however: Both cities look lovely. Toxic yellow clouds hover over abandoned parking structures in a darkly lit Gotham. A derelict roller coaster is a stark contrast to the skyline in the distance. Green parks, sunny lighting, and tall skyscrapers make Metropolis a joy to travel in--and above. Some instances--warehouses, offices, and the like--aren't particularly eye catching, and many character models are devoid of detail. Yet these aren't huge faults in a game that excellently re-creates famous fictional cities and then encourages you to gild them with glowing rings of fire and colorful balls of energy.        Whether you prefer to stay solo or group up, DC Universe Online goes out of its way to be friendly. In some cases, simply standing near another player that performs a mission task--successfully defending a pedestrian, for example--gives you credit for the same task. Kill stealing is rare because you get credit for the kill as long as you landed a single hit on your target. Furthermore, your travel options (flight, acrobatics, and superspeed) make it easy to get across town in a relative hurry, particularly if you upgrade your travel method in the associated skill tree. Even when you're on your own, missions stay relatively easy, though the frequency with which enemies respawn can lead to occasional frustration if you're adventuring alone. Of course, you can always group with friends or join a league (DCUO's guild equivalent) if you want company. And you need company if you want to take on bounties, which are familiar, powerful superheroes and villains that pop up in Gotham City and Metropolis. You can also take down opposing players by joining a player-versus-player server, temporarily activating your PVP flag to make you vulnerable to the opposition, or by joining others in the competitive arenas.      DC Universe Online's player-versus-player arenas aren't as potentially unbalanced as those in Champions Online, but stuns and knockbacks are prevalent, so skills that deliver and protect you from such punishment are more helpful than when you're dishing out pain on non-player enemies like OMAC cyborgs. PVP is one of DCUO's late-game mainstays, rewarding you with currency that can be spent on better gear, which makes you more powerful and, of course, then leads to even more gear. Grinding arenas to earn new items isn't the only endgame option, however. Once you reach that upper limit of level 30, you gain access to some of DC Universe Online's more entertaining options. These include larger raid dungeons, new four-person instances, and two-person dungeons called duos. Duos are particularly enjoyable, such as one in Gotham University in which you slash up (or beat up, or shoot up) swarms of mummies and scarabs before confronting a histrionic Isis. If you were hoping for a greater challenge from DC Universe Online, the endgame content is where you will find it. Don't expect to bring down Chemo, for example, without a game plan and a good player in the tank role.        Which version of DC Universe Online you choose to play depends entirely on which quirks you're more willing to endure, though some issues are common to both platforms. Voice chat is a nice feature when it functions, though that only happens to be some of the time. Sound effects sometimes go missing or get muddled when there is a lot going on at once. Neither platform allows you to drop missions or share them with your groupmates. PC players will be immediately struck by the console-focused interface and the overzealous profanity filter, which inexplicably can't be turned off. However, loading times on the PC are zippy, and the game runs smoothly as you soar across the skies. The PlayStation 3 version is noticeably more sluggish. Menus take too long to pop up; the frame rate chugs along every so often, or the game might freeze for a second or two; and the telltale texture pop-in common to games using Unreal 3 technology is all too prevalent. Yet all things considered, the menus are simple enough to navigate using a controller, and the combo-focused combat feels natural on the platform.      These and a few other scattered glitches aside, DC Universe Online is relatively stable at this early stage, which makes it an even more attractive option for anyone who tends to shy away from these sorts of games. If you are one of those people, DCUO's flashy, combo-driven combat and visual pizzazz will draw you in from the beginning and keep you entertained for a few weeks. It's also hard to ignore the license's appeal, which is best showcased in the excellent scenes that play at the end of instanced story missions. Yet DC Universe Online tips its hand early on; in all too short a time, it stops offering any real surprises, remaining approachable but never wading too far from the shallow end of the pool. If you've been around the block and are looking for a new virtual world, this isn't the universe to call home. But if you long to face off with Mr. Freeze or stop The Flash dead in his tracks, this is a fun way to flex your superpowered muscles.      "
4861,Outlaw Chopper,2.0,0,"  Some people might argue that the Grand Theft Auto series, for all the attention it gets, wouldn't amount to much if you stripped out the games' top-notch storylines, consistently excellent voice acting, unique sense of style, clever mission designs, enjoyable driving mechanics, engaging combat, and sheer environmental scope. For those who believe this, your messiah has arrived in the form of Outlaw Chopper. This budget-priced PC action game strips out all of the above from the GTA formula, leaving only the most bare, skeletal mechanics required to make for a functional game. And it is functional--but as far as entertainment goes, Outlaw Chopper is completely bereft of anything of the sort.        Outlaw Chopper tells the story of a rogue biker on the hunt for revenge. As said biker, you've just been released from prison after a five-year stint. You were set up by another biker named Blade, who sold you out to the cops, then proceeded to take over your operation while you were wasting away in the clink. Now alone and with no rep to speak of, your job is to work your way through the crime-filled streets of Rockland, doing assorted missions for various criminal types in order to get back what was yours and extract revenge. If this sounds like the basic setup for just about every GTA-esque game from the last few years, that's because it is, but with bikers. Frankly, the story never really comes across as anything but an excuse to get you out on the streets of Rockland, riding around aimlessly and occasionally killing people.     Potentially this wouldn't be so bad, except that the gameplay is the unfortunate combination of achingly dull and badly realized. One key detail that must be made clear from the get-go is that you never, ever get off your bike in Outlaw Chopper. All the missions are built in such a way that every objective merely involves you riding around from place to place. When combat does occasionally rear its ugly head, you're forced to awkwardly shoot or swing your weapon while trying to steer the world's most unwieldy motorcycle at the same time. It would help if you had halfway-decent aiming controls to work with, but sadly, you do not. So instead, you're forced to try and fumble your way through every instance of combat without scrambling to pull up your start menu and frantically click on the uninstall button. This is, of course, a losing battle.     The bike itself is an unholy beast, difficult to steer, even more difficult to stop, and constantly threatening to send you flying after bumping into a seemingly innocuous object at a relatively low speed, or blow up after a few well-placed gunshots by various denizens of the city who are shooting at you for no explained reason. The physics of the bike just feel broken. Trying to slow the thing down is practically an exercise in futility early on, because you literally have to stop braking several blocks before your intended destination, or you're going to blow right past the thing. Likewise, trying to slow down to take sharp turns rarely ever works correctly. Unless you come to a near-grinding halt at every single turn, odds are you'll overshoot the angle and go crashing into a nearby building. Suffice it to say, this gets very old very quickly. It also doesn't help matters that you can only control the bike using a keyboard-and-mouse setup. The game purports to support gamepads, but every gamepad we used popped up a ""this button is already bound to another action"" error, even when said buttons are assigned to nothing.     As the game goes on, you can improve the feel of the bike a bit by buying new parts for the thing. In fact, right away you should buy the most expensive brakes in the game, because without them, you're hosed. Even with them, you still feel like you have to give way too much lead time in order to come to a total stop, but at least it isn't quite as horrendous as it is with the default parts. Beyond this, you can improve your bike's armor, acceleration, and the like, but these improvements aren't especially tangible when driving around, so it's not hard to feel like you're riding on a mobile money pit.     The game's mission designs run the archetypal GTA mission gamut, but only on the most base level. You'll do assassin missions, tailing missions, robbery missions, race missions, and in the early goings, a lot of courier missions. The trouble with all of these missions is that practically every single one feels tacked on, rather than a part of a cohesive progression. One minute you're murdering enemies, and the next you're delivering invitations to a little girl's birthday party. And with the exception of the combat, there's nothing to any of them. They're like purely mechanical copies of the types of missions you'd find in a GTA game, with no soul behind any of it. You're frequently left with a sense that you're just going through the motions, much the way the developers clearly just went through the motions in designing this game. Things are made a bit more complex by the total lack of a retry option. If you fail a mission, you will have to drive all the way back to where that mission began to start it over, and you'll be forced to watch the introductory cutscene each and every time you start over, as there is no option to skip it.        Graphically, Outlaw Chopper is, in a word, atrocious. Your first order of business will need to be to up the game's resolution to the highest it can feasibly go, because on any resolution but the top ones, the game looks so horrifically pixelated that you'll wonder if the publisher didn't accidentally ship a pre-alpha version of the game. This isn't to suggest that the game looks particularly good in high resolution, either, but you can at least look at the game without wanting to claw your eyes out. Everything in Outlaw Chopper just has an exceedingly low-rent look to it. People, buildings, cars--all of it is overly angular, chock-full of nasty-looking textures, and just plain ugly. You'll also run into plenty of random animation and camera glitches, too. If you drive your bike into a guy that's supposed to give you a mission, he'll magically appear on top of your head every time, and start walking around on an invisible plane in midair. If your bike ever gets in too narrow an alley and you have to back up, the camera will go utterly spastic and try and induce a seizure out of you. The whole game is loaded with goofy stuff like this, many of which are kind of funny the first time you see them, but then just become kind of depressing after a while.      The game's audio is measurably better than the graphics, but not by a whole lot. The voice acting is rather stiff, but the material the actors are given isn't exactly high art, either, so they seem to make do. The basic sound effects are kind of cheesy but not out of place, and the soundtrack is made up of the sort of generic rock and metal you'd expect. It basically sounds like what would happen if Black Label Society made music for TV commercials.      There are approximately a billion games on the market right now that ape the GTA formula, and do it a metric ton better than Outlaw Chopper. In fact, as if the game's horrible gameplay and production values weren't enough of a tragedy, there are actually real, honest to god Grand Theft Auto games available for the PC platform that currently retail for less than what Outlaw Chopper costs. Do yourself a solid, and don't play this game.  "
1585,Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure,7.0,2,"Tetris had recently exploded on the scene, Dr. Mario stood out for its peculiarities. In the first proper 3DS installment in the series, Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure, the formula is tweaked ever so slightly, providing you with something new to try even if you spent far too many hours playing the original version on the NES or the bite-sized chunks that appeared more recently in the NES Remix series. Despite the adjustments, the core design remains intact. You still move colored pills as they fall into the play area, flipping them around in an effort to line up four or more pill segments and viruses of the same color. Find success, and maladies and medicine disappear, leaving you with more room to maneuver. You win when all the nasty bugs are gone, or you lose if the rising wall reaches the top of the screen. The ""Miracle Cure"" part of the game refers to special new power-ups that now appear by default. These drop periodically once you fill up a meter that rests alongside the play area. There are four types. One variety looks like a bomb and vaporizes anything within range once it lands. Another is V-shaped. If you match it with several pills or viruses of the same color, everything on the screen that matches that hue will vanish. A circular capsule with a “C” engraved on it wipes out all its brethren but leaves the viruses in play. Finally, arrow formations eliminate all objects in a horizontal row, a vertical column, or a cross pattern. Nowhere are the miraculous power-ups featured more prominently than in the game's new mode, Miracle Cure Laboratory. It presents 50 puzzles that ease players into the game's design, and you can use the tutorial option if you need more assistance. The available stages are quite fun, particularly because some of them force you to play in ways you otherwise might not try. A few of the challenges are genuinely puzzling, relying on more than just twitch reflexes as you get rid of virus clusters. For example, you might need to stack pills in a column so they reach the same elevation as a series of vertical arrows and then drop a horizontal arrow in place so it eliminates and activates those other arrows. It's a shame there aren't more puzzles available, though. Even a middling Dr. Mario player probably won't require more than 3 or 4 hours to conquer them all, which just doesn't feel like enough when every other mode borrows so heavily from past house calls. The game's title doesn't make it obvious, but Mario isn't the only physician on the scene. Luigi also returns for an encore performance, following his 2013 starring turn in Dr. Luigi on Wii U. The lankier brother throws pills that are stuck together in L-shaped formations. Dealing with them requires a different sort of planning because the combos that are a good idea when Mario hands out doses are now practically required. If you can’t think a few steps ahead, you're in for a bit of trouble. It's fun for a few rounds, but also exasperating compared to Mario's more conventional treatment, because a run of unhelpful pills turns into a disaster twice as quickly. Outside the Miracle Cure Laboratory mode waits the Custom Clinic, which you can configure as you see fit. Here, you can choose between Mario and Luigi, depending on which pill formations sound the most interesting at the time. Then you can either compete against an AI opponent or a wall of viruses that slowly rises as you place pieces. If you go with the former option, things can get frustrating if you don’t play quickly. When the AI makes a lot of matches in short order, you must deal with handicaps. Blocks suddenly might refuse to turn, or pressing left on the d-pad might make a block move in the opposite direction. Such effects only last a short while, but they make things difficult in a way that extra debris does not. That's not necessarily an improvement, but at least it's different. If you're looking to enjoy an experience that precisely matches the old NES game, you're out of luck. The Custom Clinic is as close as you'll get, but there are some differences. You no longer have the option to start with only a few pills and then advance from stage to stage, which at one time was standard in a number of Nintendo's puzzle games. If that's how you want to play, you're better off turning to Dr. Mario on the Virtual Console. Much like Luigi and his wonky capsules, the Virus Buster mode appeared previously in Dr. Luigi. In this mode, the player holds the 3DS sideways and uses a stylus to manipulate pills instead of the d-pad and face buttons. The action's pace slows substantially here, and it needed to. Flipping and dropping pills with a stylus doesn't feel nearly as intuitive because it's easy to accidentally flip a pill when you intended to drag and drop it. That kind of mistake can ruin your whole game if you aren't allowed at least a split-second to recover. The slower pace also allows multiple pills to eventually start dropping at once. You can move them around in any order you like or even grab falling debris to set up combos on the fly. It's an interesting switch from the norm, and things get fairly frantic on the higher settings, though Virus Buster doesn't lend itself to lengthy sessions in the way that classic Dr. Mario modes do. Multiplayer modes make up for most of the ancillary modes' shortcomings, at least, and could go a long way toward keeping Miracle Cure in heavy rotation if you have interested friends. You can play locally with a buddy (Download Play is offered in the event he or she hasn't purchased the game and doesn't mind you choosing the rules that govern play), or you can battle on the Nintendo Network. In either case, you have your choice of doctor, and Miracle Cures can be disabled if you prefer, though the lack of stage progression keeps this option from allowing a proper replica of the original Dr. Mario. When you play online, rankings are tracked for each different setup, which should keep things competitive if enough people play. Currently, though, the online scene is rather barren. Considering how long Dr. Mario has been around, the modifications here serve as a pleasant surprise and manage to inject a fresh element into a puzzling experience that is by now a bit long in the tooth. Even without the new content, Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure is a worthwhile addition to the serious puzzle fan's gaming library. It just doesn't offer enough that's new compared to Dr. Luigi to warrant a glowing recommendation if you already invested in that other recent release."
4634,Hellboy: The Science of Evil,4.0,0,"  There is a moment in Hellboy: Science of Evil when you have to face off against a hideous gorilla/octopus hybrid. It roars with anger as its slimy tentacles writhe like sloppy worms. At this point, your adrenaline should gush as you raise your stone-encrusted fist to do battle with this horrific abomination. In practice, you'll slurp up a rogue strand of drool as you halfheartedly pound your well-worn square button for the umpteenth time. In a game where even swinging half-formed frog men around by their prehensile tongues can elicit a hearty yawn, it's not surprising that facing off against a monster that should reside exclusively in nightmares feels downright boring. The only thing Hellboy does really well is make you appreciate how far the beat-'em-up genre has evolved since games that play like this were commonplace.         Hellboy has a beef with a witch who refers to herself in the third-person. You'll spend the first half of your quest trying to shut her up for good before you suddenly decide your real enemy is a horde of cyborg gorillas. The story is a convoluted mess of inadequate motivations and long soliloquies given by every skeleton you meet along the way. Instead of simple explanations that keep you abreast of why your missions are taking seemingly random turns, you are given such contemporary one-liners as ""We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto."" Despite the cursory effort given to constructing this nonsensical tale, the cutscenes are all too frequent and far from concise; plus, you can't even skip them. Ron Perlman lends his voice talents, but while it's fitting how often he mutters ""That was easy,"" his usual smarmy punch is nowhere to be found.     The main draw in a game involving an endless stream of enemies should be an entertaining combat system. There is no such draw here. You'll spend the majority of your time rapidly slamming the square button to punch with the occasional gunshot thrown in for diversity. This game is so easy you don't even have defensive maneuvers in your repertoire. Why would you need to block when your foes barely even attack? Enemies will meander up to you then simply stand still, waiting for you to turn around and smack them in the face. It's not uncommon to find yourself surrounded by a gang of ugly ghoulies only to walk away with your life bar still at the optimal level. You can pick up unwieldy swords and spears to give your aching fists a rest, but these serve as only graphically different versions of the same tired battle mechanic. Later enemies have bloated health bars, which force you to use discarded weapons to dispose of them in a timely manner. This serves to only frustrate because even the heartiest sword will shatter after three blows. Though these enemies take longer to kill, they never pose a serious threat to your own life.      The only time you'll find yourself challenged is when obstinate puzzles and directionless level design lead you down the path of frustration. In one level, you are told to light torches to continue on your way. After using flaming spears to pass the first few sections like this, you come to a point where that tactic inexplicably doesn't work anymore. Instead, you have to reach your hand into an already lit torch and extract flammable bullets--a technique never explained prior to that moment. In another level, late in the game, you have to find tiny switches hidden along walls. Again, this maneuver was never exhibited before, which leads to a frantic search trying to figure out how to progress. The game is full of moments where it appears to be broken, at least until you realize that you just need to stumble upon some random solution.        Science of Evil is as likely to win awards for its technical prowess as Hellboy is for being a dapper duke. It makes sense that the game keeps a relatively steady frame rate because it never tries to do anything that will actually push the hardware. Character models lack detail and diversity--you'll see only two or three different types per level--while textures are muddy. Fortunately, the game runs without any noticeable hiccups even when a second player jumps in locally or online. Though cooperative play often makes a game more fun than slogging through alone, an extra player here merely makes this already easy adventure even less challenging.      There is no reason to waste your time with Hellboy: Science of Evil. Even fans of the comic won't find much to dig here. The story is handled so inexpertly, it will only anger those who have invested hours reading the paper exploits of Hellboy. Weak combat and ugly visuals should deter those just looking for a solid beat-'em-up. With expectations for licensed products already so low, it's a testament to how poorly designed this game is that it can't even live up to the mediocre games around it.      "
2990,Trauma,4.0,0,"Myst style, while searching for photographs and using mouse gestures to ""solve puzzles."" Those words deserve the quotation marks because these aren't puzzles. Each of Trauma's four scenes tells you exactly what to do with minimal effort--though you might argue that approaching this game as a traditional puzzle adventure misses the point. Perhaps Trauma is solely meant to inspire introspection or reflection on a particular theme. Unfortunately, it fails in this endeavor as well. There is plenty of visual and thematic allegory, but it doesn't coalesce into an evocative whole. Trauma is a tiny slice of nothing: 45 minutes or less of clicking for a high price of $6.99.          Trauma opens with a combination of live-action scenes and montages of images from within the game. A young woman and her passengers enter her vehicle, and she drives off. The car's headlights and taillights are depicted on the street as disembodied beams, and an entanglement of red and white intimates a serious accident. Then: a close-up of a closed eyelid; a shot of her face, covered by a breathing mask; close-ups of X-rays; and other brief images. The game menu then unfolds, and you select one of four vignettes that explore the survivor's dreams as she lays in a hospital bed, each a heavy-handed metaphor for some aspect of her life. A teddy bear crushed under an enormous weight; a ghostly figure rushing away, just out of reach; a lonely path that always ends exactly where it started. The themes are quickly obvious: lost childhood, the never-ending search for parental approval, and the like.      You interact with these scenes by clicking on various hot spots within attractive, photorealistic images that give the impression of moving about an actual place. This interaction is similar to how you move about in Myst and its ilk. As you click about, the woman narrates in an affected, emotionless manner; comments on the scenes; and gives you the solution to reach one of the level's four different endings. Photos are scattered about these areas. Some depict moments from the woman's past, while others introduce you to Trauma's single interesting gameplay element: mouse gestures. By swiping the mouse downward, you can zoom out. By swiping it to the right, you move to the node on the right. You also learn vital gestures that let you interact with certain views. One of them allows you to lift heavy objects; another clears underbrush out of your way. There are four such gestures, and each level introduces one of them.         That is actually a lot of description for what turns out to be hardly anything worth talking about. Each vignette has one main ending that you reach by performing (in the right place) the special gesture the level introduces to you. It takes about five minutes to click around, find the solution, and perform it; thus, the first time through, it takes about 20 minutes to complete Trauma. Each vignette has three alternate endings, however, that are uncovered by performing the gestures you learn elsewhere. Finding every photograph and seeing every additional ending might take another 20 or 25 minutes, meaning you can see Trauma in its entirety in less than an hour, with time to spare. And you won't find doing so a challenge. The photos and voice-overs tell you exactly what you need to do and where. Trauma requires no thought whatsoever.    The Path, Linger in Shadows, and other experiences have experimented with the medium's power to engage players in atypical ways. Trauma wants you to get lost within its heroine's dreams and remembrances. It doesn't want to challenge your problem-solving skills; it wants to challenge your emotions. And it fails. This woman is a shadow. You know nothing about her at the outset, and you emerge from Trauma knowing little more. The voice acting is emotionally distant. The woman is an actor reading a script, not a victim struggling to survive. There is no triumph in seeing her overcome her adversity because there is no connection between you and her. Trauma's themes are universal. Perhaps it intends for you to examine your own life as if it were you in that hospital room. But its ham-fisted metaphors and detached lead character discourage such analysis.         It is nice to look at Trauma's photos and vignettes. Maple trees dot an office park; a lonely road twists into the distance. Surreal sights, such as a crane lifting a giant heart, punctuate the levels, but to what end? The symbols are so smack-you-on-the-head obvious that there's no sense of mystery. The lead character and storytelling are so aloof that there is no emotional involvement. The way you interact with the game is too simple to encourage thoughtfulness. And the environments--highways, thickets--are too prosaic to promote reverie. Trauma doesn't have much to say, and it takes almost no time to say it. At $6.99, it's a waste of time and money.     "
1317,Monster Hunter Generations,8.0,2,"You learn--sometimes through repetition, often through failure--how to deftly use your weapons. You have to watch your prey carefully, plan out an attack, and when the beast starts to limp, then you go in for the kill. When you fail, it's almost always because you were too greedy, you rushed headlong into battle instead of being patient, biding your time. This is the flow that Monster Hunter Generations captures so perfectly, and which lies at the heart of why Monster Hunter is such a consistently well-regarded series.Last year's Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate added a couple of new weapons, as well as the ability to attack from above and mount your prey. Monster Hunter Generations retains 4 Ultimate's additions and takes them even further with new Hunting Styles and Hunter Arts. For a newcomer who might just be getting their head around which weapon they should use, there's an intimidating amount of new info at the outset of the game, but the Hunter Arts in particular open up combos and attack possibilities that make playing the game easier than ever before.Doling out damage in combat builds up various Hunter Arts meters that have a wide range of helpful effects, from an automatic combo that deals major damage to a stamina boost that can help you escape dangerous situations. The new Hunting Styles determine how many of those Hunting Arts you're able to equip and also affect the combos you're able to pull off. The Guild Style is the closest to the standard Monster Hunter experience for people who don't like change. The Aerial Style lets you jump, making the relatively new mounting mechanic even easier to pull off. Striker Style sacrifices some combos in order to use more Hunter Arts. And the Adept Style is an advanced setup that allows players who are able to dodge and guard with expert timing to hit for additional damage.The additions don't decrease the game's difficulty, but they do provide new ways to approach combat and allow even novices to wreak havoc on the battlefield. Unfortunately, the game does a terrible job of explaining how most things work, including the new Styles and Arts. Tutorials are text heavy affairs and even within tutorial missions, you're frequently told to consult your Hunter's Notes (basically an in-game manual) for more information. To get an education on how to play Monster Hunter at the skill level required to tackle the game's tougher beasts requires finding an experienced friend or going to YouTube videos for practical advice.But a great way to jump into the game for newcomers, and to breath new life into the experience for veterans, is by playing as the cat-like Prowler. The game's feline companions have become more and more involved with the main game over the years, but in Generations, you can actively take on the role of a cat you recruit. The rules for cats are different from the regular hunters'. You can't use items--instead, cats are able to perform actions like fishing and mining without wasting any consumables. You have nine lives, giving you a few more opportunities to fail during a fight. And the cats have a whole slew of different abilities that they can learn by leveling up. The Prowlers aren't quite as hardy as the main hunter, but the focus on faster action, being able to gather resources without using items, and their unique combat abilities make them a great way to change up both the single- and multiplayer campaigns.Gameplay-wise, the Prowlers are fairly self-explanatory, but the customization, abilities, and leveling system is very different and much more complicated than the standard hunter. Like with most things in Monster Hunter, either trial-and-error or online guides are a much better way to figure out how things work than wading through the frequently sparse in-game explanations.Otherwise, Generations hews closely to 4 Ultimate: the musical score is great and worth wearing headphones to fully appreciate. The excellent online multiplayer system, despite the lack of voice chat, provides stable connections whether you're online or in the same room as your friends. Generations even tries to make the game's primary systems easier to access. The multiplayer arena has a staging area with all of the amenities you'll find in town: tweak your character, upgrade your armor, fill up on a stat-boosting meal. The hunter area is so friendly that in some ways, it makes exploring the game's towns feel almost unnecessary.Each town is full of visual personality and offers new quests to collect from the townsfolk, but those quests could just as easily be collected elsewhere. Admittedly, it would be annoying to constantly check the stock of each town individually for new items or needlessly go back and forth between towns to get to the actual game of hunting. But, outside of the nostalgia elicited by character cameos from previous Monster Hunter games, you're not given any compelling reason to explore or visit the different locations.It's easier to hang out in the main hub since that's where you have to go to group up with other people anyway. But spending any amount of time there highlights Generations’ bigger issue: there's no good reason the game should separate its single-player and multiplayer content. Calling them that is a bit misleading. To clarify, the main game, with separate towns and NPCs, is only available offline and as a single-player experience. The mostly nonexistent story about powerful monsters sits far on the periphery of the game. But the Hub area, where you can group up with other players or take on challenges on your own, offers up the mostly the same quests with mostly the same rewards but minus the story.Essentially, to get the full game experience, you have to play through almost every quest twice, but you can only increase your publicly displayed Hunter Rank by playing in the Hub. The same problem existed in 4 Ultimate, but that game got away with it to a degree by giving you an evolving town and a more cohesive narrative to explore in single-player. In Generations, there isn't enough of a divide between playing with friends and playing on your own to make the separation feel like anything more than artificial padding.But none of Monster Hunter weaknesses are able to drag down the core experience. That artificial padding forces you to fight the same monsters over and over again, but that's something you'll want to do anyway to complete the best sets of armor and just better at the game. Monster Hunter Generations' tutorials are obtuse, and you can only learn where to find some rare items by dumb luck or by looking them up in a guide. But the combat system still offers the same deep rewards it always has. Monster Hunter Generations still feels like a niche, punishing game that bears more in common with Dark Souls than an adventure game you'd typically find on 3DS. But that punishment never feels arbitrary.After dozens of hours I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of this adventure--there are other weapons and Hunter Art combinations I want to try, and of course, there are many more monsters to hunt. With Monster Hunter you get out what you put into the game, and Monster Hunter Generations is a game that compels me to put in more of my time."
743,God Eater 3,6.0,1,"Part of a series that has historically been for PlayStation portable devices, God Eater 3 is the first entry created with home consoles and PC as its primary platforms. Also significant is a new developer, Marvelous, a studio perhaps more well-known for its contribution to games with prodigious amounts of swimsuit DLC than the stuff of the monster-hunting variety. This tonal shift isn't as evident as you might think, though, especially since the series was already awash with anime tropes and aesthetic choices. God Eater 3 doesn't deliver any real twists and honestly, that's fine. The real friends that you make along the way in God Eater games aren't the ones with compelling backstories; they're the ones that help you kill Aragami with the sort of precision reserved for surgical procedures.Aragami are representative of the evil threatening the world--they're gigantic predators that devour everything in their wake as the world drowns under deadly ash storms. A nightmarish fusion of beast and mech, there's something brutal about their designs, which hammers home the divide between the alien and the organic world that you have to protect. You're the mostly-silent star in this particular story, doomed to take up the thankless job of Aragami eradication for people who have treated you like an expendable weapon since infancy. There's a predictable follow-up series of events: You're liberated, you recover from your trauma through the power of friendship, and then you meet a life-changing person who isn't quite who they appear to be. There are plenty of similarities between the core story of God Eater 3, the previous entries in the franchise, and whichever monster-fighting anime is currently trending on Crunchyroll, so while it's an entertaining tale, temper your expectations for crushing moral dilemmas.What will likely exceed your expectations, whether you're familiar with God Eater's particular brand of slaughter or not, is the combat. While it's easy to draw parallels with Monster Hunter, God Eater 3 is a fair bit closer to Devil May Cry's style of action. It's fast-paced and frenetic, reliant on chaining high-octane and high-mobility combos without getting hit in order to efficiently dissect Aragami. You have no shortage of movement options, including a specific command for Dash abilities, and you can effortlessly switch between melee and ranged combat. The feeling of stabbing an Aragami's plated shins with your greatsword in close combat before flying away and firing a shotgun shell right into the exposed wound never really gets old.Another mechanic, which is now a staple of the God Eater series, is the ability for your weapon to consume the essence of the beasts you kill. In doing so, you get to enter Burst Mode, giving you better damage output, flashier combo moves, and increased range on your basic attacks. The effects vary depending on your weapon loadout, which offers an interesting level of strategy for you to consider from mission to mission. The most difficult bosses in the game have a similar mechanic of their own, where attack patterns can grow a host of other deadly variables, making your defensive strategy just as important as your damage output.Unfortunately, the game's difficulty curve is fairly stagnant until about the halfway mark, when it suddenly ramps up by increasing the number of baddies you need to take down at the same time. This can lead to an initial feeling of being underpowered for these tense stand-offs, where you'll have to rely on every ounce of your skills to not get nailed to the wall by twice as many deadly laser beams and teleporting death machines than what you're used to.It's not all smooth sailing when it comes to the nuts and bolts of God Eater 3, either, with a number of small annoyances. One particular gripe here is that the game binds multiple options to the same input, and most frustratingly, the button to loot will also be bound to another action (whether it be dashing or blocking, depending on the control scheme) which makes looting a pain. Flitting around the maps as quick as you please is fine and dandy until you want to pick up something useful, like crafting materials; you have a higher chance of careening face-first into a nearby enemy.Another issue is the presence of the various customization systems that the series has accumulated over the years. There are crafting systems, ability systems, what seems like well over 100 possible skills to use, and upgrades on top of those too. Fiddling with a million and one variables to make your character perform better is neat at first, but a mastery of those systems isn't at all necessary to do well in the game, meaning it's easy to ignore them.The rest of the time spent as a God-eating machine is an affair punctuated by expository cutscenes and managing your various AI companions on the fields of war. The AI perform well enough at their respective jobs of doing damage, chaining skills, and trying to keep you alive if necessary. If you're craving a little more of a human feel to those connections, then there's the option of taking on the fast and furious multiplayer Assault Missions where pile-driving Aragami into the ground with mates before the timer runs out is the name of the game. It's a welcome reprieve from the grind of the single-player mode and its buffet of relatively run-of-the-mill missions, so having it as an option is a refreshing change of pace for the series.God Eater 3 is a solid entry in the franchise that doesn't necessarily reinvent itself, but it doesn't have to. All the core things that make God Eater so enjoyable, from the lightning-fast combat to the anime stylings, have been given a new lick of paint and propped up enticingly next to additions like the well-tuned Assault Missions and creative enemies to make one delicious package. Some aspects of the game--like its difficulty curve and multitude of superfluous customization systems--miss the mark, but it's an enjoyable romp with plenty of raucous battles if you're hungry for an action RPG."
346,Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat,6.0,1,"Pop Tap Beat follows the standard rhythm genre format: notes travel from one side of the screen to the other (in this case right to left), and you tap the screen when each one reaches a circle to score points. The closer to the circle the note is when you tap, the more in rhythm with the song you are and the more points you score. It's a simple system that's easy to understand and pick up even if this is your first time playing a rhythm game, making for a short learning curve and a longer focus on fun.The gameplay loop offers incremental increases in challenge with each subsequent difficulty level, offering an experience that's challenging without ever feeling impossible. Notes come in two colors: red, which signals tapping the drum, and blue, which signals tapping around the edge of it. Higher difficulties will split the drum in half, meaning you not only have to pay attention to the color of each note but also keep in mind which side of the screen needs to be tapped. Pop Tap Beat mixes things up further with special notes, alleviating any monotony. These special notes include drum rolls with continuous tapping, golden drums for furious tapping, and balloon notes for a different kind of furious tapping.Touching the drum in time with the notes feels natural, as if you're playing the drum yourself. Silly animations of dogs dancing and colorful fireworks accompanying certain notes liven up performances so you're not just seeing alternating red and blue notes and moving your fingers in time to the rhythm for every song. It put a smile on my face. Completing longer sequences, especially if you achieve full song combos, feels rewarding with so much colorful on-screen feedback celebrating the achievement. Unfortunately, full combos can sometimes be frustratingly messed up thanks to inaccurate tap controls. The game does not accurately respond to every note, sometimes registering notes early, late, or not at all. It's a rare occurrence, but a frustrating one when it does happen. Imagine conquering every note of a song as fast as Gimme Chocolate by Babymetal, only to lose the combo on the final note through no fault of your own. Your phone might end up in the next room.The song list mixes classical music, Japanese pop songs, original Taiko no Tatsujin pieces from across the series, and even some anime soundtrack classics. Some additions are admittedly weird--why does The Alphabet Song need to be a part of this game again?--but others like the aforementioned Gimme Chocolate or Tekken 7's Heat Haze Shadow 2 are absolute bangers. Oh, and A Cruel Angel's Thesis from Neon Genesis Evangelion is here in case you want to feel sad while you tap along on your mobile device-turned-taiko drum.These songs create a nice variety of tracks for anyone to enjoy, though admittedly it's not as robust as it could be. Only 31 songs are included in the game and they're all available from the beginning. There are no unlockables and no DLC song packs available (as of this writing), which is a bummer. I want to keep playing Pop Tap Beat, but with such a limited number of songs available, the game loses its luster fast. As much as I absolutely love the song, I can only play Cha La Head Cha La from Dragon Ball Z so many times before getting bored.Longevity is the biggest obstacle facing Pop Tap Beat. Going online to challenge random players extends the playtime a bit, but it doesn't change the core problem of the song list being too short. Connecting to other players, however, takes a long time. Minutes can go by before a match is finally found, but once matched it's a clean experience, with no hiccups in notes registering or lag in notes coming down the path.Points are earned after each song, which eventually unlock ""Treasure Boxes,"" but the only prizes found in those boxes are costumes for my little taiko avatar or other ancillary additions. There's nothing wrong with these prizes--my drum looks like a cute little peacock and I would die for it--but they're window dressing at best. They don't add substance to the game, only style, and again because of the short song list, eventually you'll be playing the same songs over and over again to unlock everything. After a while, that gets tiresome.The colorful whimsy of dancing animals that plays out on-screen during a song is delightful, but there's only so much a playlist that small can doTaiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat is a solid offering for Apple Arcade, though you won't be playing it for a terribly long time. Tapping to the beat of the 30+ songs on the playlist is fun, the colorful whimsy of dancing animals that plays out on-screen during a song is delightful, but there's only so much a playlist that small can do, and so you may find yourself lacking a reason to stick around. It's fun while it lasts, but Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Tap Beat only marches to the beat of its own drum for so long."
4601,Valhalla Knights 2,4.0,0,"  Creating your own band of characters, taking them on dangerous quests, then watching them slowly become richer, more powerful, and equipped with much cooler gear can be a powerfully engrossing experience. Valhalla Knights 2 proves that it can also be extremely tedious and frustrating. This rote dungeon crawler for the PSP is not worth even a few minutes of the countless hours it will try to take from you.          The story here is standard and uninteresting. In ages past, a battle raged in the kingdom between the destructive Goddess of Judgment and the noble Witch of the Crystal. Now the conflict between their acolytes stirs anew, and your character joins an anti-Goddess order of knights and sets off for war. The story advances in fits and starts, moving at a snail's pace. The overwhelming majority of your time will also be spent engaged in action that has no real connection to it. This isn't a story-driven game by any stretch. The plot is more of an afterthought than an integral part of the experience. It's just a flimsy structure on which to hang all of the dungeon-crawling you'll be doing.        That would be fine if the dungeon-crawling were more compelling. Unfortunately, the gameplay is marred by a number of frustrations that make the whole experience a real chore. You start by creating a character, which is a simple process that involves choosing from one of five races and one of five jobs. Then you select from a handful of different face and hairstyle options. The job you choose at the start--be it fighter, mage, priest, thief, or monk--doesn't limit your experience later. You can switch between jobs at any time, and you'll end up creating playable ally characters for your party as well, so you'll experience each of the available jobs during your time with the game.      As you navigate your way through the numerous monster-infested dungeons, battling bees, bunnies, dragons, mushrooms, pixies, insects, robots, and all manner of other creatures, there are no random encounters. You see all the foul beasts moving about on the world map, and coming into contact with any of them sends you into battle. You're tossed into the thick of battle without any kind of tutorial, although you can read up on all the details in the manual. If the game took a moment to familiarize you with the options during combat, however, it would have been helpful because there are lots of them. On the other hand, the game's real-time battles tend to go by so fast--in such a quick flurry of blows--that you probably won't end up using many of the available options much anyway. To access magic spells, for instance, you need to call up a menu, indicate the spell you wish to cast, and then select the target for the spell. That may not sound like much, but considering how fast things are happening, it's actually a significant amount of time. Because there's no option to pause the action to issue commands, having spells and items buried in a few layers of menus limits their effectiveness during battle. You may be better off setting your AI-controlled allies to handle such things as casting healing spells while you do the grunt work of running up to enemies and hitting the attack button. You can have up to six members in your party, and your companions tend to stick to the behaviors you designate for them, which makes them effective support. In any case, the combat is simple and shallow, lacking both the strategic depth found in many role-playing games, as well as the visceral fun found in good hack-and-slash action RPGs. That's a shame because you'll need to do an awful lot of it in Valhalla Knights 2.     To earn a little extra scratch for your monster-slaying efforts, you can undertake quests at a guild that involve heading to a certain area and killing a predetermined number of a certain monster. Oddly, there's no indication of how much progress you've made toward completing a quest, so it's up to you to keep track of how many more creatures you need to slay before you can head back to town, collect your reward, and start the process all over again. What's more, you can only undertake one quest at a time, which is tremendously inconvenient and results in a whole lot of unnecessary back-and-forth travel. And while you can find items or learn spells that let you warp back to town from a dungeon, you can't warp back to where you came from. As a result, a very significant portion of your time is spent just passing through the same areas over and over again. And you can only save your progress at inns, so should you make your way deep into a dungeon, only to fall in battle, you'll once again have to hike all the way back from town. You might also get lost trying to find your way back because the dungeons are full of forking paths and the map only shows your immediate surroundings. Each of these frustrations could have been alleviated with basic features found in other RPGs, which makes their absence here baffling.     There's an option for two players to take up to three characters each on some missions that are as mundane as those found in the single-player game. Experience and items earned here carry over with your characters back to the single-player game, but if you're playing with someone whose characters are significantly more powerful than yours, you're liable to get slaughtered because the strength of the monsters appears to be on par with the more powerful characters in the group. You can also pit your party against your friend's characters in an arena battle in which the victor wins a wagered item or set amount of gold from the defeated player. It's more interesting than fighting the monsters you find throughout the dungeons, but not by much.          Valhalla Knights 2's visuals are unremarkable. The limited options for customizing the appearance of your characters are disappointing, and while towns have a quaint, charming design to the buildings with interiors that have some attractive touches, such as windows with light streaming in, the monster-infested areas in which you spend most of your time are bland, and lacking in detail. The action plays out smoothly, though, even with several party members and monsters battling it out at once. The sound is thoroughly lackluster, with repetitive music that may put you to sleep and muted sounds of battle that lack any sense of character or urgency.       Even if you're just looking for the satisfaction of killing monsters, leveling up your characters, and scoring some nifty loot, there are so many better options than Valhalla Knights 2 available out there. Thus, there's really no reason to bother with this tedious, frustrating, and generic dungeon crawler.    "
440,Super Mario Bros. 35,7.0,2,"Super Mario Bros. 35 marks something of a historic moment for the multitalented plumber. In Mario's extensive past, there have been plenty of multiplayer games, but many of these come in the form of sporting spin-offs or asynchronous multiplayer where you take turns attempting levels. Even the likes of New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 3D World--both of which feature competitive elements--ultimately revolve around a shared goal of completing levels together as the main objective. This is where Super Mario Bros. 35 stands out; Mario's latest in a long line of entries is the first time you compete synchronously against other players on traditional platforming courses. It's a significant achievement both in and of itself and as an online multiplayer experience, even if there can be a few dull moments.In the vein of fellow Nintendo Switch Online release Tetris 99, Super Mario Bros. 35 has you compete against up to 34 others simultaneously to be the last Mario standing, playing levels from the original NES Super Mario Bros. Like Tetris 99, your play area takes up the center of the screen while everyone else's concurrent games form a surrounding border, allowing you to glance at opponents' progress as you jump your way through course 1-1 and beyond. Essentially, the main two factors separating Super Mario Bros. 35 and Super Mario Bros. is the pressure of competition, plus a lot more enemies to navigate.As is the case with most of Mario's platforming adventures, running out of time or dying are your only two methods of failure. However, there are no extra lives to be had here, only one chance per round to become the only Mario remaining. In your quest to be the number one mustachioed Italian man, you disrupt other players by defeating enemies, who will then be sent over to other courses. Additionally, taking another note from Tetris 99's playbook, you can select who to send those Goombas and Koopas to or let a preset choose--such as who has the least time remaining or anyone who's actively targeting you.Causing chaos by sending waves of baddies to competitors is fiendishly fun, knowing you're inconveniencing them at every step. It also forces you to approach these familiar Mushroom Kingdom levels in tangibly different ways. Instead of speeding through and trying to slide down the end flagpole in record time, you're thinking about what approach will actively cause others to slip up in response. This means trying to take down Hammer Bros. as opposed to running straight past them and trying to make Piranha Plants pop up in tricky locations. On the receiving end, it's brutal encountering a rogue Bowser--or any wave of minions in a tight space, for that matter.As tricky as facing off against several Bowsers in a random course can be, it's a great way of refreshing decades-old content to make it feel like a new challenge all over again. Similar to how seeking out opponent fodder changes your course approach, dealing with different enemies in unfamiliar environments creates variety in a way perhaps only the Mario Maker games have done previously. These unique challenges alter each course's rhythm, warping your sense of muscle memory and course layout knowledge to intelligently generate a slightly different experience each time you jump into Super Mario Bros. 35.In the absence of extra lives, Super Mario Bros. 35 finds an alternative use for coins in the form of random item power-ups. As soon as you collect 20 coins, you can press X to bank them in return for an item decided by fate. This could be a Mushroom or Fire Flower power-up, the limited invincibility-inducing Star, or a POW Block that clears the screen of enemies. While the random allocation of items puts you at the whims of chance, you create your own luck to a degree by collecting enough coins to have multiple rolls of the metaphorical ? Block.From many angles, Super Mario Bros. 35 is a very different beast to the many Mario platformers you know and love--which is simultaneously a strength and a weakness. Survivability reigns supreme over speed, which often rewards slower play to the detriment of excitement, particularly during each round's final moments.The beginning to middle stages of each round are by far the most exhilarating as you dash through courses while dodging the many nefarious characters invading your game. Ironically, Super Mario Bros. 35 slows down significantly when the music speeds up to signal that only five players remain, and even more so when it becomes a duel against the sole other Mario standing between you and victory. This is because it's often best to play conservatively, focusing on just trying to survive rather than be aggressive. Although some one-on-one battles I had were tense and exciting standoffs where we both took risks, the majority of my wins came from dull, drawn-out attritional affairs where instead of feeling like I had won, it felt more like my opponent had lost. These final showdowns drag due to the fact that courses keep randomly cycling through with no end in sight--playing through 1-1 yet again doesn't make for a grandstand finish. Unlike other games occupying the battle royale space, Super Mario Bros. 35 lacks a definitive tiebreaker element that increases the stakes in order to encourage aggressive play and make late-game moments more exciting.While much of Super Mario Bros. 35's variety is inherent due to its online multiplayer nature, there are a couple of other game modes to try your hand at--albeit with some caveats. 35-Player Battle is the main mode but throws up an early confusion. Supposedly, you cast a vote to determine the course everyone starts on--at least that's what the official Nintendo website says. In practice, pretty much every 35-Player Battle I played started on 1-1, which contributes to the game's pacing problem because things start off so leisurely. Special Battle, the other main mode, imposes unique conditions such as starting on a particular course or everyone beginning with 35 coins or a particular item. This mode encourages more aggressive play largely due to greater course variation, as starting on later courses before everyone has accumulated masses of coins whittles down the field much faster. Unfortunately, Special Battle is a limited-time mode, only available to play during specified time periods, meaning you're stuck with 35-Player Battle most of the time.Adding to the frustration in course variety is how Super Mario Bros. 35 makes unlocking new courses needlessly slow. To be able to vote for a wider range of courses or hone your skills in practice mode, you need to have beaten the course in either 35-Player Battle or Special Battle. However, because courses cycle through randomly and repeat so frequently, you're never guaranteed the opportunity to unlock anything each round. Super Mario Bros. 35 does employ a ranking system where you unlock different player icons by leveling up, and coins accumulated each round can be spent on beginning the next round with a power-up--but they aren't particularly enticing incentives.Super Mario Bros. 35 does offer other avenues to feel like you've achieved something, though. After winning your first round, Coin Challenge unlocks, showing you your highest coin count in a win and assigns a rank based on where you sit among other players. It's cool that Coin Challenge displays historical data too, providing an incentive to return each week to best your previous efforts and rise up the leaderboard. Additionally, Super Mario Bros. 35 tracks and charts many different statistics, including total wins, players knocked out, and how many of each enemy you've defeated. This data is a neat little extra that gives a bit more meaning to each round.Although I can only judge Super Mario Bros. 35 on how it plays right now, it feels like it has a strong, scalable base, much like how Tetris 99 felt at launch. Super Mario Bros. 35's availability will supposedly be limited, however--at the time of writing the game will only be available until March 31, 2021. The reasons why are a bit of a mystery, but as things stand it seems like there's plenty of potential for the game to grow into something bigger with subsequent updates and in-game events.Delivering precisely what is advertised, Super Mario Bros. 35 delivers on familiar 2D platforming with an all-new competitive twist. Playing against 34 other Marios at once is a wonderful type of mayhem, as is facing off against hordes of enemies. However, early course repetition and late-game lulls slightly temper this Mushroom Kingdom celebration of Mario's 35 years."
1603,Sym,4.0,0," Boiling down what Sym is about is simple: You play as a person trying to escape the prying eyes of other people by escaping into a world where they can't follow you, one where you can be alone. This is reflected in your experiences by your ability to sink into the floor and emerge upside-down on the other side. Suddenly, what were once solid platforms become empty space to move through, and vice-versa. Occasionally, you run into switches that cause blocks to appear and disappear in patterns marked with arrows, and, of course, you have to avoid enemies and hazards. However, most of the game's identity lies in its dual nature, forcing you to think about how far you need to progress before you have to switch orientation. Mapping out the correct path to the end is the most engrossing part of the game.   Sym's mechanics falter when they're put to the test, however. The floaty jumping mechanics don't match up well with the frequent pinpoint platforming you're required to do. It's pretty difficult to land on a patch of safe ground only as wide as you are with the amount of control the jump physics allow, and not in a good way. Compounding matters is your character's hitbox, which extends past your actual body ever so slightly. You'll die by drawing too near a saw blade without ever actually touching it. And then there are narrow shafts you have to fall into at just the right angle or else get stuck awkwardly along the edge. The levels themselves are interesting thanks to good use of the orientation switching mechanic, but that's the only bit that works as advertised. These issues are small, but they add up, sucking away the promising potential Sym initially displays. But its biggest failing is in how it fails to convey anything meaningful about its inspiration from social anxiety. You can see the obvious starting point for the extended metaphor in the central mechanic. Sinking into the floor is synonymous with hiding from the world's prying eyes as they try to drag you out into the light and consume you. What developer Atrax Games is going for here is pretty clear because of the game's very literal interpretation of these platitudes. The first set of levels features giant eyeballs that stare at you without trying to hurt you. In these levels, only environmental hazards, like sawblades and pitfalls, can harm you. Later stages have actual enemies that will kill you, like carnivorous plants that spontaneously grow out of seeds you see on the ground or hungry beasts that pace back and forth looking for a meal. Even the people you meet later on prove to be foes, pulling you out of your hiding place in the ground as you dissolve in a fit of social paralysis. It's all very on-the-nose, but you can see a vague character progression as fears intensify and you careen towards either finding friends amidst your anxiety or hiding away forever.   Though the game practically screams its inspiration at you, it has nothing coherent to say about social anxiety. The levels feature the aforementioned allusions to a hazardous world you must hide from, but everything else is muddled. The levels themselves rarely tell any sort of story on their own. Instead, anguished phrases are used to fill in the gaps where the game's thematic design drops the ball. But these also confuse any thematic ties the game manages to establish by reading like a moody high school student's musings scrawled in the margins of a notebook. That in itself is a cool idea, and it goes with the pencil-inspired graphics. But they don't reveal anything or lead the themes anywhere except to depict anguish for anguish's sake. Until the game splits off briefly into two different sets of final levels, the messages convey the same depth of pain and panic throughout. In fact, they sometimes border on incoherent ramblings not dissimilar to the stereotypically exaggerated dialogue you'd hear from a schizophrenic person on an episode of Law and Order, which matches poorly with the meager thematic progression the levels suggest. It's confusing, distracting, and occasionally insulting to those who suffer from social anxiety. The few themes that do come through loud and clear--hiding from social situations, the fear and consequences of being caught in one, and the eventual message that finding and sharing the connections and burdens between people is the beginning of the answer--all would make a fine foundation for a game like Sym if they were handled with more subtlety. Likewise, the erratic writing plastered everywhere contributes very little, actively obscuring any sense of progression the themes try to develop. Even when divorced from its themes, Sym manages to be mildly entertaining but just shy of a competent game thanks to the many small yet significant design flaws you have to work through. Most disappointing, though, is that Sym manages to successfully convey nothing enlightening, moving, informative, or even coherent about social anxiety. Hiding may be a central mechanic in Sym, but obscuring your meaning to this baffling degree is never the answer."
4302,Cops 2170: The Power of Law,4.0,0,"  You know a game has some problems when it doesn't even seem to get its name right. After all, Cops 2170: The Power of Law sounds like it's missing a word or two. The Power of Law? Is that like Huey Lewis' ""The Power of Love""? Unfortunately, the title is the least of this Russian-designed game's problems, as it is all downhill from there. Cops 2170 is a game that's obviously inspired by X-Com and other classic turn-based tactical games. However, it falls far short of the bar set by X-Com. This is one of the worst turn-based tactical games in quite a while, thanks to bad gameplay, horrendous storytelling, lackluster graphics, and more.        Cops 2170 is the story of Katy, a young police academy graduate out to tackle a corrupt and dangerous world. You control Katy, as well as the members of the squad she recruits, as they battle crime in both the upper and lower parts of the futuristic city that they protect. One of the few interesting features in the game is the branching storyline, which lets you decide which factions you want Katy to assist. Do you assist the corrupt cops? Then again, are they really corrupt? Katy's naïve outlook on the world opens up some interesting questions as to who you can really trust. However, this glimmer of interesting potential is wasted, as it doesn't take long after the first mission for the plot to collapse in a convoluted mess involving mutants, evil corporations, corrupt cops, bloodthirsty robots, evil clowns, gun-toting giant rats, and more.     And no, we're not making any of that up. Part of the story's problem is that it relies on so many tired clichés...but a bigger issue is that the game is poorly written, poorly translated from Russian, or, most likely, both. The dialogue is awkward and clumsy, and the delivery by the voice actors is almost painfully bad at times. Aside from all the tedious exposition between missions, which is needed to try to explain the plot, the in-combat dialogue includes gems such as, ""I am fragile and vulnerable, so be tactful or I'll break your hands."" Be prepared to hear that, and other such lines, over and over again.     At the heart of any turn-based tactical game is the combat, and this is also an area where Cops 2170 is sorely lacking. It's just simply bad, especially compared to other recent turn-based tactical games. It's as if the underlying game mechanics go against convention and common sense. For example, the fog of war limits what you can see to what your characters can see, which is standard for this genre. However, the execution of fog of war will frustrate and confuse you. Each of your characters has an extremely narrow cone of vision, so enemies and objects keep popping in and out of sight, almost haphazardly. The fog of war is also inconsistent in that you can always see some objects (such as ""parked"" vehicles) while similar objects (such as vehicles that you can control) disappear if you turn your back on them. There are also artificial limitations in the fog of war, most notably of which is your character's vision. Each character has various attributes, such as strength, agility, and vision, all of which can be upgraded over time. Vision is important because it determines how far your character can see. However, even on a perfectly flat battlefield where you should be able to see to the horizon, your vision is still limited and you won't be able to see your enemies until they come into your vision range. It's a contrived limitation that is a particular issue at the beginning of the game when you have low-level characters with short vision ranges. By the time you detect the enemies, they're going to be all over you.     The combat itself is frustrating, and there's no way to fix it because there are no difficulty settings to choose from when you start a game. Weapons are hideously overpowered, which means that a single shot can kill a character. As a result, you'll have to resort to a tedious save-and-reload strategy, saving the game whenever you make any progress and reloading whenever your luck runs out, which will be often. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence is practically brain-dead, as it has no concept of tactics or even self-preservation. Both good guys and bad guys will randomly walk around, even during a gun battle. Or, they'll charge directly at a gun and they'll be promptly killed. Or, they'll stand around and do nothing, even as they're surrounded and being shot at. There is no sign of any kind of intelligent behavior at all. Meanwhile, the levels themselves are big, probably too big for this game. In some cases, the levels are so large that by the time you can get your characters to the battle, friendly AI forces will have already finished off most of the enemies. But wait, it gets worse. Once combat begins, the game remains in turn-based mode until the last enemy is hunted down. This often leads to tedious hunts, as you have to walk around the level in turn-based mode until he's located.     Your characters have access to a wide variety of armor, weapons, grenades, and ammunition, as well as cybernetic implants that can boost your aim, health, and more. However, the inventory system is clumsy at best. The system is based on each object taking a certain amount of space in your backpack. Yet there's no autosort functionality that optimizes the available space in your pack, so you'll have to constantly juggle items around to make room for a new weapon or a piece of equipment.        Cops 2170 has a very eccentric design that combines Blade Runner with cyberpunk, but the visual look of the game has bigger issues than simply style. The graphics engine looks ancient by modern standards. The levels are fairly bland, as there's just not a lot of detail packed into them. This is somewhat of an issue with a turn-based tactical game, because that means a lot of open spaces without a lot of cover. The character models are relatively primitive, and the textures in the game are bland and lackluster. In other words, Cops 2170 looks very much like a game from five years ago. The sound effects and music in the game are also poor. Aside from the aforementioned bad voice acting, the weapon and sound effects are very basic, and the music sounds like your generic European techno. There is no multiplayer component, and since there is only the default difficulty level, there's not much replay value, either. The game is also a bit unstable, as it will crash back to the desktop on occasion. In summary, Cops 2170 may be a game with a few interesting ideas, but they're completely overwhelmed by mediocrity and poor execution.   "
4673,Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,3.0,0," The original Backyard Wrestling game was released last year, and despite the fact that it was an all-around poor effort, it still showed the slightest glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe the franchise could eventually become the entertaining, hardcore alternative to standard wrestling games that it aspired to be. With Backyard Wrestling 2, it's now apparent that those hopes and dreams have been almost completely dashed. The sequel suffers from basically being the exact same game that came out last year...but with a couple of half-baked gameplay changes thrown in that just make the game even easier than it was before. Furthermore, there's an arduously long and dull career mode that could only be less entertaining if it were capable of giving you a painful rash of some sort. This game is just flat-out bad in most every way you can think of, and for a franchise with such promise and potential, that's a truly disheartening thing.      Let's start with what actually has been improved in this year's game, since there's not very much of it. The game's roster of wrestlers features more than 20 combatants, including several notable hardcore grapplers, like Mad Man Pondo, Vic Grimes, Vampiro, New Jack, Sick Nick Mondo, Ruckus, Sandman, and, of course, the Backyard Wrestling cover boys Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J, the Insane Clown Posse. But, of course, this wouldn't be Backyard Wrestling without a couple of other random celebrity personalities thrown in for good measure, and in There Goes the Neighborhood, these personalities come in the forms of adult film actresses Tera Patrick and Sunrise Adams and the always mind-blowing metal head Andrew W.K. The overall lineup is much more recognizable than the one found in last year's game, but it's still mostly geared toward those who actually follow and understand underground wrestling.   The gameplay engine features a couple of added mechanics, though they don't end up making a lot of difference in the game. The basic additions to the highly rudimentary wrestling engine include submission holds and a block button, both of which were absent before. There's also a new type of environmental attack, appropriately titled an ""enviro-mental"" attack. These contextual attacks occur during grapples, when you're positioned in just the right area. With the simple press of a button, you'll be whisked into a cutscene that will have your wrestler doing something crazy, like powerbombing your opponent through a picnic table or repeatedly slamming his or her head into the trunk of a car. While no one will argue that these aren't laudable bonuses to the gameplay, the simple, glaring fact remains that the wrestling engine is still terribly underdeveloped.   Everything about the wrestling in Backyard Wrestling 2 just feels incredibly sloppy. The striking mechanics and the grapples... Both are so basic and repetitive that after about two matches, you'll have mastered the entire game. Then again, the whole point of Backyard Wrestling is that the wrestling is almost totally secondary to hitting your opponent with whatever trash is littered throughout the environment. Chain saws, weed whackers, bricks, and pieces of broken tables... These are just some of the things you can use to beat your opponent senseless and bloody. But, just like last year's game, these weapons simply can't salvage the gameplay. All the weapon hits just seem so halfhearted and underwhelming. You rarely ever get that sensation that just makes you want to cringe in pain, because none of the weapon hits are cringe-worthy. They are just too quick, and the sounds of blows or cuts barely register. A mere chair shot in a typical WWE game, or even a simple body slam in Def Jam: Fight for NY, sounds about a hundred times more brutal than a fluorescent light tube crashing over someone's skull or a brick thrown across a fight zone and into someone's face in Backyard Wrestling 2. Considering that this game is supposed to be all about total brutality, this comes across as pretty pathetic.   There are also a lot of glitchy, generally dumb things that hinder the gameplay even further. For starters, the hit detection is just awful. Weapon tosses that miss a wrestler, seemingly by several feet, will still register hits. Characters will sometimes just somehow magically fall out of grapple positions and transport themselves back to standing positions elsewhere. Anytime you're in a multileveled environment (like in the game's swimming pool area, for instance), and you're standing on the upper level--while your opponent is on the lower level--you can just stand while facing your opponent with a weapon in your hand. Then you can swing the weapon. The strike will inflict damage on him or her, even though you're several feet above your opponent. The enemy artificial intelligence is also quite bad. Enemies will just run around a level, periodically swinging at you or trying to grapple you. But thanks to the game's incredibly easy countering system, you can almost always get out of a grapple. And even if you have trouble countering, it doesn't matter, because all you have to do is either take advantage of any of the game's collision exploits or just keep punching and grappling over and over again to never lose a match. The AI just can't keep up with an aggressive pace, so it's just entirely too easy to roll over it constantly. As a result, no match should ever take you more than a couple of minutes, tops. You can also play two-player matches. However, even without the lame AI in the mix, the game still isn't any fun.      Another big problem with Backyard Wrestling 2 is that the whole thing just gets extremely old, extremely quickly. This is mostly because there's hardly a thing to do in the game, thanks to its paltry selection of play modes. Apart from the obligatory exhibition match, the only other mode in the game is the career mode, which is an effective replacement for the terribly lousy talk show mode in last year's game. The career mode features a simple premise. Backyard Wrestling has come to your town to offer up a $1 million prize to any backyard grappler who can plow his way through the competition and win all the regional championships in your previously peaceful burg. Sounds like a neat enough idea, but that's ultimately about all it amounts to.   First, you begin by creating a new wrestler via the game's limited create-a-wrestler mode. Granted, there's far more to customize here than there was in last year's incredibly sparse create-a-wrestler mode, but all the different costume customizations you can make are just patently ridiculous. Ever wanted to make a spiky-haired, morbidly obese wrestler with a tutu, night-vision goggles, and a pair of flippers? Then you're in luck, friend! Otherwise, though, there aren't too many options that come outside of the goofy side of things. So if you just want to make a tough-guy wrestler, your options are limited.   Once that's out of the way, you'll find yourself with three areas on a map of the town unlocked. In each of these three battle areas, you'll find yourself presented with a number of missions that you'll have to complete to unlock that region's title tournament. These objectives run the gamut from performing a specific number of counters in a match to performing a specific number of special moves. That's it. You don't even have to go on to win the match. Once you perform the objective required, you can just quit the match and go on to the next objective. Eventually, the game does run out of ways to make you perform specific numbers of moves specific numbers of times, so then it starts throwing some curveballs. Even then, it's still mostly very simple and boring stuff. Basically, you'll have to keep doing this stuff over and over again in each area to keep unlocking title tournaments to participate in so you can win belts and so on.   What this all boils down to is the plain and simple fact that the career mode just has little to no entertainment value whatsoever. The missions are all terribly lame, and apart from some side matches you can take on to earn extra cash for the game's shop area--where you can unlock additional silly outfits for your created wrestlers, as well as some crazy real-life wrestling footage--there's just nothing else to it. Computer-generated cutscenes periodically rear their ugly heads between regions and totally fall flat. Whether it's the Insane Clown Posse jawing at you because...well, just because...or whether it's New Jack taking a second to stab a reporter in the face with a fork for no particular reason, there's just no coherency to any of these sequences. So they're completely skip-worthy every single time. Actually, skip-worthy pretty much sums up the whole game.   Graphically, Backyard Wrestling 2 represents a marginal graphical improvement over its predecessor. The models are a little less blocky-looking, but considering how ugly the models looked in the last game, these models are a pretty weak step up. The animation is just as bad, if not worse, here than it was in the previous entry in the series. Nasty environmental clipping, glitchy moves, and otherwise unpleasant-looking problems plague each and every match. The wrestling environments are probably the best aspect of the game, visually, but that doesn't mean they're all that good. Just like in the last game, they're all thematically designed after one trashy location or another, ranging from a simple backyard, to a trailer park, to a brewery. Each has interactive elements, as well as plenty of weaponry scattered about, and aesthetically, each looks as well as it should, though there's nothing markedly impressive about any one of them, either. Neither the Xbox nor the PlayStation 2 version has a leg up on the other, and the game looks roughly the same on both platforms. So, basically, neither looks good.      The audio is another big point of contention in the game. Though, once again, Eidos has gone out and licensed a collection of name bands for the soundtrack, including Andrew W.K., Kool Keith, the ICP, Bad Brains, Body Count, and Hoobastank, this offering's soundtrack isn't as consistent as the last one. It lacks the decisive theme that the last game's soundtrack had, and some of the music actually feels a little out of place. Of course, a slightly out-of-place soundtrack is like pure gold compared to the game's consistently terrible sound effects. Even when they work properly, the effects here are so underproduced and cheap-sounding that they completely wreck any impact they should have on the overall action. But then again, that's only when they actually work. There are plenty of sound effects that actually seem to be completely missing altogether, which leads to big dead spots where some sort of punch or slam sound should be heard. There's also some exceptionally bad voice acting from the wrestlers and celebs, but, unfortunately, it actually works...unlike the sound effects.   In short, you don't want to play Backyard Wrestling 2. This game is everything you hated about the last one, but it's been spray painted over with a few cheap gimmicks to try to gussy up what ultimately amounts to a pretty pitiful package. If you like hardcore wrestling, go buy some videos or DVDs, because most all the brief snippets of video found in this game can be found just about anywhere else in extended form...and in better-quality format. And when you factor in that these snippets of video are about a billion times more entertaining than this game, you're really left with no reason at all to entertain the notion of picking up Backyard Wrestling 2.   "
1112,The Town of Light,4.0,0,"Based on real accounts from the 1930s and '40s, The Town of Light focuses on Renee, a young woman who's suffered from severe mental illness for the majority of her life. Her struggle began with sporadic blackouts as a child and eventually developed into bouts of anxiety and the sounds of strange voices in her head. Pushed over the edge by the horrors of a sexual assault, Renee is callously committed to the real-world Ospedale Psichiatrico di Volterra, an understaffed, overcrowded asylum in the Tuscan town of Volterra, Italy.You assume control of Renee after the fact; at a time when the asylum has long been abandoned. She's a somewhat unreliable narrator, failing to recall exactly what occurred during her tenure at the asylum. The vast majority of your time is spent wandering the halls and grounds of the large hospital, piecing together what happened to Renee during her stint. You revisit sites of traumatic events, discover and study pages from her journal, and page through medical records, which offer eye-opening insight into the horrifying, violent ways mentally ill patients were treated nearly a century ago.While The Town of Light struggles with portraying the ways in which people cope with mental health issues, it at least makes piecing Renee's story together an interesting process. The twists and turns therein are paced well enough that you'll remain engaged throughout. Some exposition may be drip-fed to players through found documents and the like, while big story beats are presented as hand-drawn cutscenes. Each method is linked to a different part of Renee's story, whether it’s recalling the doctors who abused her, the fellow female patient who helped her explore her own sexuality, or the circumstances that led to her hospitalization in the first place.These moments are carried by solid art direction; letters are detailed and appear to be written by hand. Flipping through Renee's journal reveals a number of dark and thought-provoking drawings that supplement the anecdote she's sharing. Despite the generally static presentation, the game's hand-drawn cutscenes utilize a unique crosshatched, watercolor style. When it comes to the The Town of Light's tiny details, there's plenty to admire despite the heavy context that surrounds it.While the hospital is large, with tons of rooms to explore to find the aforementioned narrative tidbits, the drab and ugly environments do take their toll, and not in a way that reinforces Renee's tragic story. For the majority of the game, you'll walk through the same hallways filled with similar-looking rooms looking for scraps of evidence, guided only by vague objectives. This persists until the last third of the game, when you step outside the asylum's walls--a turn that isn't as uplifting as it sounds.At first you're sent to the asylum's outer grounds to examine headstones in a graveyard, but you're then transported into a cognitive labyrinth in Renee's mind. You'll walk endlessly, trying in vain to figure out where to go and what to do next. Suddenly and for no explicable reason, you're sent back into the asylum. Both of these sections are confusingly designed, stretching on far longer than feels necessary. It's at this stage that The Town of Light stops being an interesting examination of a troubled mind, and becomes a frustrating game that may not be worth completing after all.At least on Xbox One, all of this is made worse by poor technical performance. There are consistent frame rate issues when you're exploring outside the asylum, where turning in any direction also results in noticeable screen tearing. Load times are equally off-putting, stretching on for upwards of a minute at a time. This is also the case within menus, where opening up the collectibles screen comes at the cost of about a 30-second wait.It's disappointing to see The Town of Light struggle so often, because the story it presents is both harrowing and captivating at times. While there's an interesting narrative to be found in its world, the moment-to-moment gameplay and repetitive environments impose an unavoidable malaise. Given the fact that the game is based on actual accounts of psychiatric treatment in the early 1900s, you might be better off looking up the real stories that inspired The Town of Light rather than forcing your way through a version of them here."
1270,Forza Horizon 3,9.0,2,"Developer Playground Games expands upon the previous game's regional hubs--glorified garages and showrooms to buy new cars--and turns them into their own festivals. Imagine a multi-stage music gathering like Coachella or Glastonbury, except you have to drive five miles to get to the closest tent. Sure, it’s unrealistic, but so is this series’ conceptual marriage of music and cars.To fit new fans, your handler, Keira, advises you to expand your festivals from time to time. Doing so unlocks more driving events in a festival’s respective region. Whereas the last Forza Horizon’s main campaign path was the completion of tournaments (and is still a substantial mode this time around), there’s a new emphasis on gaining followers in order to open up more events. A single region can offer at least 50 activities by the time you’ve maxed out its potential. Combine all four regions, and you have a campaign that rivals Burnout Paradise's generous to-do list.Many racing games in the last decade have cleverly crafted single-player narratives around building the player’s reputation. This has been used to attract fictional rivals and grow an imaginary fan base, the latter being the crux of Forza Horizon 3's main path. It takes the reputation game to its next evolutionary step with a lesson in Branding 101. Without blatantly using the term “influencer,” some of the most effective fan-growing events are themed on positive public relations. No joke--these sections are actually called “PR Stunts.” Once you finish rolling your eyes and accept that it’s a sign of the times, you can look beyond the propagandist window dressing and simply focus on the objectives, such as stringing together stunts or executing a single vehicular feat.Like Forza Motorsport, Forza Horizon 3’s point-to-point or circuit competitions are never bereft of split-second moments of gratification, whether it’s shaving off a tenth of a second through drafting or executing a sublime drift. Placing first is, of course, the traditional goal, but you can’t underestimate the thrill of making a clean pass against a competitor, even if it’s to avoid placing last.Forza Horizon 3 transcends the genre’s classic reward designs by pummelling you with dopamine hits well beyond the 12-car races. It’s not unheard of to gain a level, unlock a perk, expand a festival, and obtain a new car in the span of seconds. This can occur at any time, whether you’ve just completed a championship or simply avoided traffic while jetting down the highway. This is what happens when you add a fame-based component to an already robust reward system that includes the previous games’ level progression and skill trees that recognize risky behavior.It’s especially compelling if you can get a well-rounded car into a vineyard and spend the next 30 minutes laying waste to grape plantations with e-brake drifts to earn skill points. The skill tree has tripled in size for this Australian excursion. Along with the perks that enhance the ability to get more perks (e.g., improved skill point multipliers, longer skill point chains), you can purchase XP and earn bonuses that ultimately lead to new cars.Forza Horizon is known for taking sensible liberties in its real-world locations. In Forza Horizon 3’s case, that means being able to drive from Surfers Paradise to Byron Bay in 90 seconds, normally a little over a one-hour drive. Real-world locales like the Kiewa Valley and the Twelve Apostles also litter this eastern region of Oz. It’s a pleasingly subdued version of Australia rather than a caricature of it. There’s no risk of hitting kangaroos, and the local hosts don’t spout slang in every line of dialogue. There’s a generous helping of lush forests and open fields set to the often-gorgeous backdrops of weather and day/night cycles. Those who miss the Out Run-inspired coasts of Italy and the French Riviera of Forza Horizon 2 also get an adequate stretch of shoreline. In short, you won’t ever run out of photo opportunities.After Colorado and Mediterranean Europe in the first and second games respectively, the shift to Australia is fitting for a driving series that has now made room for more off-road competitions. You have to think 50 yards ahead when planning a dirt jump in a Hummer-like Lamborghini LM002. Your landing, however bumpy or misplaced, can mean the difference between maintaining the lead or fighting to escape last place. The natural unpredictability of off-road driving is a stimulating accompaniment to the more structured asphalt races.Forza’s three-year-old Drivatar system has proven itself as a viable alternative to traditional catch-up or rubber-band AI. Supplanting generic names with those of your friends and their driving behaviors puts a spin on asynchronous multiplayer. What’s surprising about Forza Horizon 3 is the wealth of social options without your friends’ real-time presence. Familiar features like leaderboards and clubs are now joined with modes that let you curate your own shareable championships and special events using templates.These forms of asynchronicity are so persistent--including the option to race a friend’s Drivatar during freeroam--that it’s sometimes easy to ignore Forza Horizon’s 3’s online component, despite the return of King and Infected modes, as well as a capture-the-flag-style mode called Flag Rush. For the most part, they’re worth trying out, if only to help friends (and yourself) knock off campaign objectives. The trade-off? Races and adversarial modes can feel like a hassle at the first sign of rubber-banding or lag, which was evident during a number of pre-release online sessions.For a game series that associates itself with ever-popular music festivals, it would be an embarrassment if there wasn't a kickass music playlist, and Forza Horizon 3 doesn’t disappoint. The return of Chvrches’, a band that stood out in Forza Horizon 2, accentuates the near-utopic vibe of this spin-off series. Some events have their own pre-chosen song to fit a given moment. It’s hard to beat listening to Richard Wagner while making an epic 500 foot leap into a gorge or hearing Night on Bald Mountain when racing to a haunted house. And thanks to Crazy Taxi, listening to the Offspring during a timed driving contest makes for a sweet trip down memory lane.With Forza Horizon 3, Turn 10 and Playground Games affirm the series’ status as the driving game for everyone. The new emphasis on off-road options isn’t at the expense of traditional races, thanks to the sheer volume of activities. All the while, Playground Games’ calculated kitchen-sink design philosophy and rich reward system persistently tempt you to explore beyond your comfort zone, whether it’s gifting your first Ariel Nomad buggy or reminding you that stunt races can impress thousands of fans. Enhancing your own brand might feel like a strange motivation to hit the road, but pulling off sick e-drifts on a mile-long series of curves makes the PR work worthwhile."
3458,Hydro Thunder Hurricane,8.0,2,"  Do you remember playing Hydro Thunder on the PlayStation, the Dreamcast, the Nintendo 64 or in arcades? It doesn't matter. All you need to know going into Hydro Thunder Hurricane--other than which buttons do what--is that there's a good chance you're going to lose hours of your life trying to leapfrog friends on its leaderboards. Enjoyable multiplayer options support up to four players locally and up to eight online, but this fast-paced boat racer really shines in its single-player events where you're regularly made aware of how your performance compares to that of your closest friend or rival. On brilliantly designed courses littered with ingenious shortcuts, figuring out how to shave seconds off your best times while navigating occasionally troublesome waves is a lot of fun. The water isn't always believable, but it serves its purpose, and given that course hazards include dinosaurs, UFOs, and even a Norse god, realism isn't something you're likely to be too concerned with while playing.           Other single-player modes on offer in Hydro Thunder Hurricane include Gauntlet and Championship. Gauntlet events are time trials made more challenging by exploding barrels that are floating in the water all over each course, while Championships are between two and eight events long and incorporate all of the previously mentioned event types. Sadly, there's no multiplayer support for Gauntlet mode or an option to race against the ghosts of other players in any mode--which would've been an especially welcome option in Ring Master. Those of you who prefer real-time competition to leaderboards are well catered to, though, with split-screen races for up to four players who compete against four AI racers, online races for up to eight players (who might be playing on as few as two consoles using split-screen), and a cat-and-mouse-like Rubber Ducky mode. In the latter, players divide into two teams, and one player from each team takes the controls of a huge rubber duck. The winning team gets its duck across the finish line first, using any means necessary.        "
3612,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Covert Ops Essentials,5.0,1,"As soon as Red Storm announced that it was working on a new entry in its Rainbow Six series, the Internet was abuzz with speculation. Could the game's title possibly be longer than the one used for Red Storm's last product, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations? Sadly, the answer is no. Compared to that game, Red Storm's newest product, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Covert Ops Essentials, is downright tongue-tied. Unfortunately, it has more serious problems than its title. Essentials is a stand-alone Rainbow Six product that's half Rogue Spear mission pack and half civil service test simulator.   In case you think you misread the last part of that last sentence, here it is again: one half of Essentials is a simulation of taking a civil service test. If you're the type of person who wants his Rainbow Six performance tests to take the form of shooting Tangos and not actually, say, taking a test, feel free to skip down a few paragraphs. For all the rest, it seems like kind of a waste to review this part of the game. If you're aching for the heartbreak and triumph of participating in a civil service exam but lack the courage to actually take one, you don't have a whole lot of other choices. In fact, you don't have any other choices. You should run - in a snake pattern - to your local software store and buy Covert Ops Essentials.    But read this first. Essentials includes a CD full of information about the history of counterterrorist agencies, operations, and equipment. After studying it all, you can play the role of any of the Rainbow Six agents and take a series of fictional multiple-choice Rainbow Six entry exams. In some sense, it's not a horrible idea. There's a lot of information included, and most of it is well written. The problem is that Red Storm decided to create its own interface for the project. What it came up with looks like a ""futuristic"" interface as envisioned by a Hollywood special effects person in 1980. It includes plenty of arcane, unlabeled icons, menus shaped like rotating spheres, and lots and lots of scrolling green text on a black background - just the way people who have never actually used a computer often imagine computer interfaces will someday look like. It's neither attractive nor functional.   Interface enhancements that exist in the real world are simply ignored in the informational segment of Covert Ops Essentials. For instance, even though there's a huge amount of information to wade through, the developers neglected to include any kind of hyperlink feature. If you see a topic that you'd like to read more about, or if you remember seeing something you want to get back to, you'll have tough luck finding it. While there is a search feature, it's useless to the point of being absurd. Every article appears to have only a handful of keywords associated with it, and the multimedia clips don't have any. For example, the disc includes footage of a 1970 airline hijacking in Amman, Jordan, but neither ""Amman"" nor ""Jordan"" will jog the program's memory enough to make it cough up a link to the clip. It should also be mentioned that the escape key, kind of the cornerstone of modern interface design, does absolutely nothing in Essentials. Add in some periodic crashes, and you end up with some potentially interesting information organized and presented so poorly that it's rendered useless.   That leaves the second disc, which, according to the box, includes nine new missions. This is only technically true. What's actually included are three new single-player missions and six very small training missions. The three single-player missions are all of high quality. The first one takes place in a jungle. It is the hardest of the three and is made harder by the fact that camouflage hides the terrorists but grants you no reciprocal benefit - they can pick you off as if you're wearing neon-orange hunting gear. The next two missions take place in an Arctic research station and a missile silo in North Dakota. Both are also well done, though much easier than the jungle level.   No new weapons are included, the enemy artificial intelligence has not been improved, and the Rogue Spear graphics engine has not been enhanced. The only feature carried over from the Urban Operations mission pack is the excellent defend mode, but it's available on only three of the nine maps.   Red Storm announced recently that it would finally release the Rogue Spear map-making tools this November. This means that in the coming months, the active Rogue Spear mod community will start distributing custom maps free of charge, thereby significantly lessening the value of new, officially released Rogue Spear levels. Red Storm's newest Rainbow Six game is a full-priced product, but it contains little more than three decent maps and a mess of unusable information. Therefore, Essentials is anything but."
1017,Steven Universe: Save the Light,6.0,1,"For most of the game, it's just Steven and up to three of his besties getting into some relatively standard RPG shenanigans. You explore the environment, pick up loot where you find it, run into wandering enemies, and take them on in active-time turn-based combat. Like its predecessor, Save the Light is an RPG from the Paper Mario school of game design. Combat emphasizes contextual button presses, where hitting your mark does extra damage, defends against attacks, or adds effects. This comes with the minor-but-nifty twist that characters don't necessarily have to act when their turn comes around, but can instead bank Star Points for more expensive abilities in future turns. Strategy comes down to determining how best to dismantle an enemy, not necessarily whose turn it is.The vibrant cardboard cutout art style manages to admirably convey the spirit of the show without being an exact copy. One area, the Strawberry Battlefield, is particularly stunning, with warm green natural beauty and plump fruit engulfing the still-discernible remains of deadly weaponry and wartime detritus. The game’s fixed camera angles give you a good look at the expansive environments; however, the camera often has trouble adjusting as your party moves around the map, and sometimes the camera doesn't follow you at all.The character animations are also a source of joy, with every little action conveying a ton of personality. Peridot doing a fiddly Super Mario Bros. 2-esque Luigi jump is one of those little treats that constantly makes you smile. The music follows suit: While the number of tracks is limited, the tunes themselves are pretty well in line with the show's 8-bit sounds, with gentle synth pop. Even here, the glitches rear their ugly head, with music from the overworld frequently continuing to play when you open the menu screen, leading to a dissonant overlap between tracks.Traversing the environment presents the most debilitating problem of the game, which lies with the AI. All four of your party members are onscreen at once, and it's all too easy for characters to get stuck behind objects, seemingly forgetting that they have the ability to jump and could use it to regain freedom. To make the situation worse, the game doesn't auto-teleport lost characters to your location when a battle starts, so getting into an encounter with a glitched-out party means that the battle starts with only one character, or sometimes not at all (which can only be fixed by quitting and restarting the area). Latter portions of the game are extremely puzzle- and platforming-heavy, which exacerbates the problem.Still, the game almost makes up for it by staying staunchly true to its source material, as far as the fine details go. Fry bits and donuts restore health; Together Breakfasts heal the entire party; you can use Bismuth's forge to upgrade weapons; Onion sells goods in hidden areas of every stage, like the shady little criminal that he is.But where the show's personality really shines through is in the character progression: While leveling up gives characters a number of upgrade points to pour into different stats, the most powerful attacks and abilities are predicated off of the characters looking out for each other. A few of the basic attacks utilize that philosophy by themselves; Steven can play his ukulele for his allies to boost their attacks, and Greg can do the same and heal them (it's worth noting that these instruments add guitar/ukulele tracks to the background soundtrack). When the relationship meter between two characters is full, they can either perform a team-up attack... or if it's two Gems, they can perform a special dance that allows them to meld together and become a Fusion (an ultimate version of each Gem from the show that can deal out major damage).After a particularly tough battle, Steven will often stop the journey in its tracks to tell one of his traveling companions how great they are, which not only increases their relationship, but grants additional XP. Yes, every character can just hammer away at enemies and still do well--but true success in Save the Light is nothing without a little help from your friends. Save the Light plays like your typical RPG, but the notion that you're off on an adventure with your best friends is tied to the game’s systems in an extraordinary way. If this was all Save the Light was, we'd be talking about a simple-but-enjoyable RPG, and a pitch-perfect way to hang around in Steven's universe between seasons of the show. Unfortunately, it’s still brought down by the fact the game being broken in some major ways."
1242,Dark Souls III,7.0,2,"Like the frosted regions of Dark Souls II’s Crown of the Ivory King DLC, the Painted World of Ariandel is a wintry landscape that sometimes obscures its dangers behind fog and falling snow. Other areas provide typical Dark Souls vistas: The dramatic reveal of a grand chapel in the distance is enhanced by the foreground view of a long, fragile rope bridge. Like a similar overpass in the main game, this rickety span offers an access point to a new area, provided you have the imagination to find another purpose for the ropes.The Painted World of Ariandel is a little bit larger than any individual DLC episode from Dark Souls II, though the generous scattering of bonfires--the series' safe havens--shortens an otherwise long journey. Many areas are as vast as they are tall. The trudge up a steep hill is a fruitful exercise in amassing a large kill count as you also manage your health-replenishing Estus Flasks. The undead soldiers who populate this hill are no zombies--they move with purpose once they see you and tactfully strike as well as any imposing Dark Souls foe.There aren't just secrets in Ashes of Ariandel but also rewards for thorough exploration. One such prize is a switch that grants you access to the main boss, and the challenge comes from enduring the vile surroundings where the switch is found: a dark, dank room filled with giant flies that aim to kill you with bleed attacks.Dark Souls III: Ashes of Ariandel accentuates the value of the journey over the destination.Another reason to search every corner? To find the ticket to gain access to the PVP arena. While this online battleground is limited to one area designed especially for PVP, its replay value is reinforced by myriad match customization features, such as setting team sizes and access to consumables. While it's not engrossing enough to serve as the DLC's main draw, the ability to play beyond one-on-one battles is a welcome twist to a fan-favorite feature.Like many Dark Souls environments before it, Ashes of Ariandel accentuates the value of the journey over the destination. It's about collecting new sets of gear and vanquishing the armed, aggressive hostiles who linger around the goodies. Typical of many Dark Souls areas, some items aren't directly accessible upon first sight. Studying the lay of the land in order to reach those items is its own gratifying brain teaser. And in classic Dark Souls fashion, a shortcut is the reward for surviving an excursion to the unlockable side of an otherwise locked gate.Ashes of Ariandel's showcase battle is against Sister Friede, whose persona as a scythe-wielding nun--a holy death dealer, if you will--is an amusingly ham-fisted image. It’s a duel that becomes all the more memorable if it evolves into a battle of attrition, although expert players can avoid such a grind. Her magic-enhanced moveset doesn't include any surprises, though her speed and expansive repertoire make her a formidable opponent for those with average skills. Success against her requires defense and patience above all else, so players who lean on the aggressive side are doubly tested. She's also a superb reminder that this series still has the ability to teach veteran players new tactics--even those who already have dozens of boss kills under their belts.The rewards for defeating Friede--a pair of frost-enhanced scythes and a curious bouquet of roses designed for flagellation--are appropriately representative of the DLC’s other unique gear. The Millwood armor set is one of the few ensembles in this DLC that makes you look like Viking, while the Valorheart grants the user a new way to shield bash. A melee weapon like the Crow Talons doesn't have much value as a main weapon over the long haul but there is gratification to having this loot as trophies for triumphing over tougher foes.What Ashes of Ariandel lacks in originality, it makes up for in cohesion with the full version of Dark Souls III. The duel against Sister Friede, the DLC's highpoint, is the type of Dark Souls boss fight that makes an indelible impression--she’s on the same level as the Abyss Watchers or Dancer of the Boreal Valley. While Ashes of Ariandel is ultimately a safe addition to Dark Souls III, it's convincingly satisfying; the risk of death at any moment is as likely as finding a new piece of practical gear or the discovery of an unexplored path. Just don't expect any areas as memorable as those in the main game or revelatory moments that substantially expands the lore."
1672,Dreamfall Chapters,7.0,2,"Coming off the heels of a rather sedentary first installment, Dreamfall Chapters Book Two: Rebels changes pace and propels the story into action. The first episode focused on finding your bearings and plotting your path; The second is all about setting that journey into motion. Book One did an admirable job of reacquainting its audience with the Dreamfall universe while providing a solid framework to build on in the chapters to follow. However, honing in that closely on the setup provided little room for follow through, and the lack of forward momentum left me less than satiated. Fortunately, the fruits of these labors are more than apparent in Book Two, which plucks off just enough to ramp up the action while leaving plenty to ripen on the vine in anticipation of what's to come. Dreamfall is and has always been a story about duality--the yin &amp; yang of Stark and Arcadia, magic and science, occupation and rebellion. These themes run deep in Book Two and offer a strong lens through which to view the bond between the journeys of two disparate leads: Zoe Castillo and Kian Alvane. Where Book One told a tale of parallel jailbreaks with Kian's escape from Azadi prison and Zoe's liberation from a Dreamtime-induced coma, Book Two continues this trend with a tale of two spies and a pair of fact-finding missions. With Kian embroiled in the Azadi conflict in Marcuria and Zoe finding herself at odds with the ever-increasing presence of EYE forces in Propast, the heroes launch headfirst into breaking down the mysteries and conspiracies within. And boy, do they have their work cut out for them.   For starters, Book Two is massive and takes over twice as long to complete as Book One. This is due both in part to the ample story progression and the introduction of a whole new, if familiar, environment in which to explore. While bigger isn't always better (and this is certainly true in some respects here), there is something satisfying about how the episode digs in, offering plenty of time to get lost in the world. There's a lot of meat on those bones, and this is excellent news for those of us who spent their time with the first book waiting for the story to go full-on Longest Journey. Book Two finally hits that stride and wastes no time getting there. Book Two opens with Kian convalescing at Resistance headquarters, the underground ring of Arcadian rebels formerly led by the Captain to combat the growing Azadi threat. It is as if Robin Hood is being introduced to the band of Merry Magicals: Kian is ordered to prove his loyalty to the cause, and before long, finds himself roaming the streets of Marcuria. While wandering through the city in the game's third-person perspective, it was difficult not to get excited to be back on these old stomping grounds, and I had forgotten just how great a contrast the fantasy vibe of Marcuria provides when juxtaposed against the futuristic, Blade Runner-meets-Beyond Good &amp; Evil aesthetic of Stark. Like revisiting the house you grew up in many years later, Marcuria is simultaneously familiar and strange. The landmarks are still here (The Magic Market! The Journeyman Inn! The Rooster and Kitty!... wait, didn't that tavern go by a different name before?), but many areas are tweaked, askew, or entirely new. While several popular haunts have been abandoned since the occupation, there are plenty of new nooks and crannies to explore, leaving Marcuria feeling cautiously lively, like a party in a prison cell. Where Book One told a tale of parallel jailbreaks with Kian's escape from Azadi prison and Zoe's liberation from a Dreamtime-induced coma, Book Two continues this trend with a tale of two spies and a pair of fact-finding missions. This is not necessarily all for the best, however. As Kian ticks his way down the Resistance's to-do list, he must do so donning an Irhadian Veil so as not to be recognized by his fellow Azadi patrolling the streets. Narratively, this makes perfect sense. Since Kian was initially imprisoned for treason, anonymity should be a high priority. In practice, however, Kian's pace slows to a crawl anytime he passes a guarded gate or entryway, which yields a lot of tedious slow-walking as he makes the transition. As it is, navigating the town is sludgy enough, and you will find yourself holding down the run button constantly just to feel like you’re moving at a reasonable pace. These belligerently slow zones, while not terribly prevalent, are enough to frustrate when moving between areas. Unfortunately, the same goes for Zoe's trek through Propast as well. While Kian works to dig up dirt on the Azadi in Marcuria, Zoe investigates a possible source of corruption within the political campaign she works for and what, if any, connection there is to the EYE and WATICorp. As Zoe gets closer to the answer, Propast's faux-pen world layout becomes less accessible to her. Roadblocks are increased, security is beefed up, and carving a path through the city becomes a puzzle all on its own. It's an effective way of communicating the EYE's growing threat through environmental storytelling, but as someone who often found himself disoriented on the streets of Propast, I did not appreciate the constant detouring required of Zoe in order to reach many of her destinations. Perhaps the most baffling detour of Book Two occurs back in Arcadia when Kian is tasked with sneaking into Marcuria Harbor to sabotage a weapons shipment. Apparently, his magical veil loses some of its mojo in this area as the guards here are able to detect Kian's presence if he gets too close, initiating a fail-state. Not only is it an incredibly awkward slog to complete, but my attempts were riddled with bugs, robbing me of success the first couple times I managed to satisfy all passing requirements. It's aggravating and flies in the face of the more cerebral types of quests presented in the series so far. To add insult to burglary, when I finally managed to reach the cut-scene, I was awarded with the Steam achievement, ""I Thought There Wouldn't Be Stealth!"" Its description reads, ""So you thought there wouldn't be stealth and also you suck at it,"" as if the lack of a proper toolset to engage in stealth--such as sneaking, or crouching, or any sort of visual feedback--had anything to do with the player's input. No, Dreamfall Chapters, it is you who sucks at it.   Mechanical flaws aside, Dreamfall Chapters soars when its quests provide the connective tissue between narrative mystery, tension, and resolution, and Book Two offers some excellent entries in this department. On their own, most missions offer little more than the deduction-based adventure-game fare familiar to Dreamfall vets. But string them together and a bigger picture comes into focus--one that leverages incremental progress with gratifying bursts of dramatic revelation. Without giving too much away, Dreamfall Chapters understands that what makes solving a key puzzle interesting isn't the act of opening the door, but discovering who's behind it and the intense conversations that arise as a result. On this note, including dialogue choices is a natural progression for the series. As we have been told, Zoe's destination is predetermined, but her path along the way is not. This jives with the way the game's Bioware-style branching conversations work. The details change, but the big finish usually remains consistent. So while there may be less expectation for player choices to have a drastic impact on the final outcome of the plot, they do have a measurable impact on the smaller, more idiosyncratic moments (Reza's lunch will have repercussions!), and I found myself enjoying the smattering of incremental payoffs rather than anticipating a much larger one that may or may not come later. Again, it has a layered effect that, when added up, amount to an effective and intricate feat of storytelling. It all comes back to the trilogy's bread &amp; butter--its cast of characters. Book Two enjoys more colorful dialogue from the likes of Mira, the abusively foul-mouthed cybernetic chop-shopper; Baruti, the Botswanian campaign manager; and the nefarious Commander Vamon leading the Azadi occupation. If Kian is the Robin Hood of the story, Vamon is undoubtedly the Sheriff of Nottingham. Dreamfall Chapters soars when its quests provide the connective tissue between narrative mystery, tension, and resolution. To keep things fresh, there is also an influx of new and notable characters gracing the second act. For instance, in Arcadia there is Lihko, a wounded Dolmari warrior outspoken against Kian's presence who begrudges him for his Azadi heritage and the sacrifice made by the Resistance to save him. He's a complex and conflicted character whose intimidating presence is amplified by his booming voice. At his side, there is Enu, a sassy feline Zhid with a curious mind and zero filter. In contrast to Lihko, her flirty frankness and positive attitude help to make Kian feel as welcome as possible given the circumstance. Without a doubt she is one of the more interesting and entertaining characters to be introduced so far. Her snarky dialogue and too-much-information attitude, especially regarding sex, inject much-needed comic relief within a group that is otherwise all business. In addition, there's the mysterious Anna, a cunning rogue who appears to have a history with Kian despite his lapse in memory of any such relationship. Also crawling out of the woodwork is The Mole, Bip the thief, Hanna the punk rock runaway, and even a familiar face or two from Zoe's past. Other than an underwhelming showing by Reza, who's the most consistently mediocre brat of the pack, this episode walks the Dreamfall walk with plenty of meaningful roles to fulfill and subvert the archetypes within. With unique and diverse characters such as these, the series continues its tradition of utilizing a fantastic ensemble cast--an aspect that cannot be understated but was lacking by the end of Book One.   The Longest Journey series is a collection of inhabitable moments and by the end of this act, I appreciated what each moment had amounted to. This is emphasized by the radically tense cliffhanger the episode goes out on, which had me questioning every step that led up to it. As these pivotal moments pass, they offer new opportunities to reflect on the events that have come before them. They have a cumulative effect that changes the way in which you see the big picture. What happens in Stark can inform your understanding of what is happening in Arcadia and vice-versa, for their fates are interconnected. And as Kian and Zoe's worlds parallel each other, Dreamfall's world parallels our own, offering social and political commentary via the themes of its stories and the lives of its inhabitants. Book Two succeeds in reminding us that our destination may be predetermined, but our path is not. It's how we choose to travel, and who we keep by our side, that makes the journey worthwhile."
3752,Dreamkiller,5.0,1,"  Psychologist Alice Drake has a special talent: She can enter the dreams of her patients and cure them of phobias by shooting the meanies that infest their brains. But Alice also possesses another amazing talent. While holding a minigun, she can contort her left arm into the most uncomfortable position without ever suffering from shoulder cramps. You'll get past the visual oddity of Alice's freaky arm in time, but Dreamkiller's other problems are less easily forgotten. This run-and-gun first-person shooter grows tiresome quickly and fails to make good use of the intriguing premise, which is a shame considering its virtually limitless potential. Some of the enemy and level designs display plenty of life and creativity and hint at the great shooter Dreamkiller might have been. Unfortunately, wonky game mechanics make this throwback twitch shooter more of an ancient relic than a welcome blast from the past.         What a great idea: As Alice, you jump into your patients' dreams and blast manifestations of their phobias. Is the patient arachnophobic? You take on hordes of spiders with your flame-spewing fingers and a helpful minigun. Does the subject have issues with machines? You clear his head of mechanical monstrosities by shutting the robotic infiltrators down for good. You may even learn about phobias you didn't know existed. Did you know that ponophobia is the fear of working too hard? Or that maniaphobes are afraid of going mad? Sadly, the potential for a cheesy-awesome story goes untapped. Levels are preceded by scantly written case descriptions, and while the still-image story scenes are beautifully drawn, they don't tell a tale worth hearing. The setup is simply an excuse to let you unload lead into crowds of weird demonic enemies a la Painkiller or Serious Sam.      The early levels are disappointing and conventional, featuring ho-hum level design, predictable enemy behavior, and all-too-familiar hyperactive shooting. And in many cases, the levels fail to capitalize on the phobia that inspired them. It makes sense that you would be shooting creepy-crawlies in an arachnophobe's nightmares, but why are there spiders in the dreams of the guy afraid of making decisions? Too many levels feature the same old corridors and arenas you've experienced countless times before, filled with enemies that are easily outwitted as long as you stay on the move. You clear the area, a door opens, and you move through it to the next area, where a bunch more meanies await. Thus, the more typical levels get tedious quickly and don't offer much in the way of challenge, so blandness sets in long before you've moved to the next nightmare.         The later levels still suffer from monotony, but they also display a lot more creativity. Some of the enemies and environments are wonderfully absurd. In the dreams of a teacher afraid of going insane, you take on masked freaks clad in straitjackets that spawn from rickety asylum cots. Another patient is frightened of children and toys. In that dreamworld, you take aim at giant tin soldiers, malformed toddlers, and giant bird figurines in a surreal playroom. Storm creatures soaring through the air, giant flaming trees, and obese medics are among the more inventive foes you face. But even when they look awesome, these monstrosities don't display any smarts, so any sense of challenge comes from sheer numbers and resilient bosses. Some of the boss characters--a hooded demon, a giant robot--are fun to take on. Others--a giant fire demon, a bee-spewing tree--are either overly frustrating or much too easy.      But whether you're fighting bland robots or mammoth medics, certain game mechanics just don't work all that well. The mouselook is super twitchy, so you'll probably want to adjust the sensitivity within the game menus. More problematic is the way weapon spawn nodes are handled. Like in many other fast-paced first-person shooters, you can pick up a weapon at a specified point--but here you can hold only one firearm at a time. (You can also shoot fire and webbing from your fingers.) But weapon pickup points are also weapon drop-off points. If you walk over an empty one, you will drop your gun and be left only with your all-but-useless fire spray. It's easy to do this accidentally in the middle of a firefight; you'll be strafing about quickly while firing at some enemy or another, only to inadvertently drop your weapon while being mobbed by demons because you passed over one of these nodes. It's a bad mechanic that has no place in a fast-paced shooter.         Dreamkiller makes a few attempts to be original, but they don't energize the action much. You can teleport forward, but plain-old shooting is effective enough that you rarely need to. There are also certain enemies that must be defeated by entering a portal that represents the patient's subconscious. This feature makes certain sequences a bit more challenging, but it adds little to the experience; in many cases, you can just move back and forth between portals shooting the vulnerable enemies on the way. If you become really desperate for a change of pace, you could check out the game's multiplayer options, but you'll probably never find anyone to play with. Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Conquest modes are available on multiple maps, but if the game's all-but-empty leaderboards are any indication, Dreamkiller's online play is--and will likely remain--dead.      Dreamkiller is, through and through, a budget game. The visuals are colorful but look decidedly old, the action is as shallow as it gets in a modern shooter, and the sound effects lack oomph. The premise is neat, and some of the enemy designs are legitimately awesome. But if you've been dreaming of some old-fashioned twitch shooting, you should return to the old standbys and let this sleeping dog lie.     "
3121,Yar's Revenge,5.0,1,"Yars' Revenge, an esoteric and experimental game that was one of the Atari 2600's original hits. As unusual as the original game was, this brand-new reboot of Yars' Revenge is perhaps even stranger. Rather than being a 2D shooter that features an insectoid hero, this reimagining transforms the titular Yar into a young four-armed female warrior wearing wasp-inspired body armor in a game heavily inspired by on-rails shooters like Panzer Dragoon, Star Fox, and Sin and Punishment. It's an interesting idea that, sadly, falters in several ways.     Yar's Revenge's art design will strike you right from the get-go, and it is hands down the best element of the game. The anime-inspired reimagining of Yar and the locales she battles in are exceptionally well done, with slick-looking environments, machinery, and monsters throughout. There are some low-resolution textures here and there, and the nondescript soundtrack isn't much of an accompaniment. But the sheer imagination and effort that has gone into the world design makes it immediately engaging and worthy of commendation.     If everything else about Yar's Revenge was as strong as the art design, it would be great. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay tries to mimic the genre's best without really understanding what makes those games good. The first layer of irritation comes from the game's control scheme, which, while similar to that in Sin and Punishment, doesn't work nearly as well. In most games of this type, your aiming reticle and the motion of your character are tied together. In Yar's Revenge, the two are separated and mapped to separate analog sticks, with functions like different shot types, homing missiles, and dodging mapped to the left and right triggers and buttons. The face buttons are used for activating collected power-ups. The aiming system can be adjusted, but it never feels completely natural; it's almost as if it were intended for a motion-control scheme that doesn't exist.        The control issues compound core problems in the game design itself. Enemies are seemingly scattered throughout levels without any regard for how their positioning impacts the flow of the action. It also doesn't help that your primary weapons tend to be on the weak side--using the default railgun to kill anything besides cannon-fodder foes is difficult, and your more powerful shots either have limited ammunition or charge times. As a result, you wind up not being able to take down most of the stuff in the level. That doesn't matter much unless you're chasing high scores though, because you almost don't have to kill anything in a level if you don't feel like it; you can just focus on dodging the haphazard shots that enemies love to blast at you. If you try to kill things and dodge at the same time, you'll likely find it an exercise in futility because it's incredibly hard to focus on aiming and precise character movement with all the stuff that's going on around you.     But Yar's most egregious issue is that it's just boring. Rail shooters are usually designed to be exhilarating and thrilling, with carefully structured and placed obstacles or challenges that make the stages interesting even if you've already gone through them before. In contrast, it's dull to fly through the gorgeous environments of Yar's Revenge. Things rarely change in the environments, there are no memorable set pieces to keep things exciting, and the bosses barely react to your constant blast bombardment beyond changing up their attacks.        Yar's Revenge is a prime example of squandered potential: a game with a good concept and strong visual design, but an execution that consistently misses the mark. Clearly a lot of effort went into creating the game's world and environments, but Yar's Revenge is devoid of the tight, structured gameplay design that makes some of its peers timeless classics. What you wind up with is a game that's nice to admire but not terribly satisfying to play.   "
1125,Birthdays the Beginning,5.0,1,"The game begins with a (rather unnecessary) framing story where you stumble into a cave one day to discover a strange cube and a voice asking you to help create and build life on its surface. The game then proceeds to guide you, via a series of overly wordy tutorials that are somehow simultaneously too long and short on information, into jump-starting the process of birthing life and the cycle of evolution and extinction that comes to define the game.Interaction with the world is done primarily through flying around a time-frozen grid, raising and lowering blocks of land to form valleys, mountains, and oceans. These simple acts have a tremendous effect: lowering land below sea level creates oceans and heats up the entire cube, while creating peaks and mountains makes the world an overall colder place. Limited-use items allow you to create freshwater rivers, bringing essential moisture to areas that would otherwise be parched.These various factors--elevation, temperature, moisture, and water type--determine what sort of life will come into existence and flourish. Once you're done shaping the land, you can step away and set time in motion, watching as the world moves on and waiting to see how your guiding hand affected the life on your cube. Some species will thrive, some will die out--and sometimes, if things are just right, you'll witness the evolution of something that sets an entirely new epoch in motion for your little world. When a new species comes into being, you can go down to the planet again, seek it out, and ""capture"" it, preserving its detailed information in your in-game library.The process of birth and death is interesting to watch, and seeing how creatures interact with each other in a complex web is an engaging process...for a while, anyway. Unfortunately, things start to go sour quickly after you get going. Since free play isn't available until you've completed story mode, you're stuck in a long campaign where the game forces you to evolve life on your little planet in very specific ways. This generally means bringing species into being, which then serve as a touchstone for other species down the line.Except sometimes, that doesn't really matter, such as when the game asks for a species that feeds on a creature that went extinct hours ago--meaning you now must spend far too much time figuring out how to bring them back into existence. At other times, it looks like you have every condition you need to cultivate a species that's required to progress, but despite fast-forwarding millions of years, they never begin to propagate in the cube due to some unknown factor the game fails to make clear.The lack of information is perhaps the biggest frustration you'll encounter throughout the game. You're constantly left guessing as to why certain factors just aren't playing out the way you expect them to. For example, when you sit back and watch time pass and the lifeforms of your planet either propagate or die out, you can't get specific details as to why they're thriving or dying. This is particularly irritating when you need certain species' numbers at a particular level--are these creatures not reproducing or advancing because it's too hot? Too cold? Do they lack water? Food? Is there not enough habitat? All you can do is look at the library info, harbor a guess, mess around with some elevation, and cross your fingers for the next time you start the clock, because all the in-game help button does is parrot the objective of your next progress goal back to you.It feels like there's a fantastic game somewhere in the heart of Birthdays the Beginning, ready to claw its way out of the primordial ooze of ideas to evolve into a wonderful god-game experience.Interface issues compound the game's structural problems. Sometimes you'll decide to make drastic changes to your cube, such as flattening out mountain ranges or raising the sea, in order to hasten to birth of certain forms of life. You'll find yourself flying around an ever-expanding cube, raising and lowering the blocks you're hovering over with R1 and R2. While you can select multiple blocks to raise/lower at once with the D-pad, finicky analog controls can make selecting specific land areas feel imprecise.Options that would help streamline drastic revamps, such as ""make everything in this selected area the same height"" and ""start a river from here,"" are only available as limited-use items. The lack of an easy undo option means that it's shockingly easy to make mistakes, such as accidentally killing off that river source you just used. Topping it all off is an arbitrary HP system that determines how much land-shaping you can do in a particular period. Given the easy recovery of HP via recovery items and resting, its entire inclusion is an unnecessary annoyance.It's a shame that the story mode is mandatory, because the game really starts to improve once you've unlocked free play mode. You're free to mess around with your cube however you want, observing with no pressure as life transforms, evolves, and mutates in response to the world you craft. This allows you to watch all of the game's cute visuals spring to life as new beings come into existence. The finer nuances of the game really come out when you don't have anything telling you how your world needs to work, and though a lot of the same frustrations with interface and lack of information remain, they're considerably less pronounced. A challenge mode is also available: Here the game gives you pre-made cubes and asks you to do things like evolve a certain species within a set time period. These challenges wind up being considerably more fulfilling and interesting than the main campaign.It feels like there's a fantastic game somewhere in the heart of Birthdays the Beginning, ready to claw its way out of the primordial ooze of ideas to evolve into a wonderful god-game experience. But the conditions for it to thrive just aren't right: The interface is ill-conceived and cumbersome, the campaign's frustrations bring progress to screeching halts, and the frequent lack of information turns what should be a fun micromanagement experience into an exhausting guessing game."
2881,Kirby's Return to Dream Land,8.0,2,"         Kirby's Epic Yarn or Kirby Mass Attack. It makes up for this with tight gameplay that is as absorbing as it is adorable. The addition of seamless multiplayer does bring something fresh to the table, and Kirby's handful of new abilities add an extra touch of comedy and silliness to the mix. You won't find much trailblazing action here, and the challenge is a light one for most of the way until you unlock the tougher game mode by completing the story. Still, there's enough charm on tap to satisfy diehard Kirby fans and younger players.  "
3250,Plants vs. Zombies,8.0,2,"  You're trapped inside the house; brain-craving zombies are closing in from all sides; and there are no firearms or weaponized power tools in sight. What do you do? In Plants vs. Zombies, now available for the Nintendo DS well over a year after it debuted on the PC, you have only one option: to strategically surround your home with a selection of combat-ready plants. Both the plants at your disposal and the zombies you're disposing of in this tower defense game come in a wonderful variety of shapes and sizes, and are introduced gradually as you play through the occasionally challenging campaign. The DS version of Plants vs. Zombies boasts the same campaign, minigames, and bonus features found in last year's Xbox Live Arcade version, and while it lacks that game's cooperative play, it does include the excellent competitive mode.       Most of your time in Plants vs. Zombies is spent either on your front lawn or out back, where there's a slightly larger garden with a pond running down the middle of it. Both are divided into grids, and each square can accommodate any one plant of your choosing. Zombies shamble, sprint, and swim from right to left toward your house, while you establish defenses that can include any of almost 50 different plants (though no more than 10 different species in any one level). Sunflowers are used to collect the sun that serves as currency, wall-nuts obstruct zombies for as long as it takes for them to be chewed through, potato mines explode when zombies step on them, peashooters do exactly what you think they do, and so on. As your arsenal increases in size, you have to choose which types of plants you're going to take into each level. You'll inevitably have favorites, but these decisions are also based on a sneak peek that you get of the zombies that are going to attack. If you see that some of the zombies are going to be attacking by floating over your garden suspended from balloons, for example, you need to make sure that you have a plant that can either puncture or blow away those balloons. Though most levels have you doing much the same thing, the ever-changing zombie horde and the different plants that you use to combat them--as well as levels set at night and in fog--prevent the action from getting repetitive.     Also keeping the action fresh are levels that take the form of different minigames. For example, there are levels in which you use wall-nuts as bowling balls, and other levels in which the plants in your arsenal are dealt to you randomly like playing cards. All of the minigames that pop up during the campaign can also be played outside of it, via a menu that lists more than 20 different minigame types. You can do battle against invisible zombies, you can play a Bejeweled variant with the plants in your garden as zombies attack, and you can even raise your own undead in a zombiquarium. Unique to the DS version are four new minigames, including one in which you have to shout (or at least speak quite loudly) into the handheld's microphone to keep your plants awake; a gameplay mechanic that thankfully only shows up once in the entire campaign. That misstep aside, Plants vs. Zombies is a game that just keeps on giving you more fun things to do long after you've beaten the campaign. Invite a second player and, regardless of whether or not they have their own copy, this great game gets even better.     It's unfortunate that Plants vs. Zombies' competitive multiplayer isn't playable online, but it's a lot of fun to check out with a friend. If you're playing as the plants, the only real difference between competitive and solo play is that you have to concern yourself with attacking stationary zombies on the far right of the screen while defending the house. If you're the zombie player, you have to defend those stationary zombies while deciding which of your undead minions to send on the offensive. You use tombstones in place of sunflowers, your resource is brains rather than sun, you have only three columns of the garden to play with, and your minions are mobile rather than rooted, but these obvious differences aside, playing as the zombies isn't wholly unlike playing as the plants. There are 18 different zombie types to choose from, though you go into each match with an arsenal of only five. If you choose the quick-play versus option, both players have access to only basic minion types, but if you randomize the loadouts (not recommended, since this can result in overly one-sided matchups and even games in which it's impossible for the plants to win) or opt for a custom game that lets you pick which types you want, you have the option to include some really formidable frontal-lobe munchers. Digger zombies mine their way under the garden and then attack plants from the rear, catapult zombies drive vehicles equipped with long-range weaponry, and trash-can zombies are slow moving but heavily armored, to name but a few.        Despite its overly busy visuals, the DS version of Plants vs. Zombies is still easy to recommend because it boasts the same ingenious game design, uncomplicated controls, upbeat audio, decent difficulty curve, and frequent player rewards. Both the PC and Xbox 360 games (not to mention those on the iPhone and iPad) are cheaper to buy than this $20 DS version, but if you've never played Plants vs. Zombies before, this is still a great way to find out what you've been missing out on.  "
1708,Q*bert: Rebooted,3.0,0,"Poor Q*bert deserves a return to glory. One of the first gaming icons born of the 1980s arcade boom, the sprightly (if somewhat profane) orange orb with legs and a comically large nose has spent many years out of the spotlight. Unfortunately, Q*bert: Rebooted will not swing him back toward acclaim. The game would have been merely a shallow, imperfect straight-from-mobile port, but the lousy controls, inconsistent graphics and animation, and exhausting tedium do more to damage Q*bert's reputation than anything the march of time could have possibly achieved. Swapping cubes for hexagonal shapes, Q*bert: Rebooted allows for some variety of movement, made painful thanks to horrid controls. With the hexagons, Q*bert allows you to traverse beyond the classic diagonal steps for both horizontal and vertical progression across a 3D board. But the controls are incredibly slippery, which makes it difficult to judge if holding right on the analogue stick will move you right or right-up or even right-down.  That is, if you're able to move in the attempted direction at all. In far too many cases, the game moved in the complete opposite direction to which I held the analogue stick. This issue, combined with the already squirrely controls, resulted in many needless deaths as Q*bert leapt onto nearby enemies or off into the surrounding abyss. The controls also make it impossible to move using the DualShock's directional pad, as you must press the required directional buttons at exactly the same time or the game will only read the first input. It is feasible to get somewhat used to moving with the analogue stick over time. But even after hours of play, I still found myself accidently sending old Q*bert off into the void, eating lives, and causing me to shout far more colorful things than ""@!#?@!"" Q*bert: Rebooted still follows the classic formula with some changes, though the design shows its age, even more so now that it is blended with tired mobile-game trappings. Completing levels is just the same as ever. As Q*bert, you start from the top of a small handful of boards ranging from a large pyramid to a rectangle. Hopping on the hexagons changes their color, and completion comes once every platform's color has been altered. Levels are broken up into three stages (which changes up enemy placement) and capped off by a bonus round where you collect gems. The premise, however, while nostalgic, hasn't matured all too well. It's fairly straightforward, and after spending several hours hopping around the same stages and dodging the same enemies, things begin to taper off into boredom. It also doesn't help that the game requires you to complete objectives and earn stars in order to unlock a gate barring off the next group of levels, not unlike in mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga. Completing a level awards you with one star, but to earn two of the available three you must also finish a time trial and play it once more to collect a fixed amount of points. There are only five stage designs dispersed among 40 levels. And to complete the game, you will need to replay the same stages dozens of times to unlock more levels that also look the same. There is no attempt at variety; it just gets so tiring. Lousy controls, inconsistent graphics and animation, and exhausting tedium do more to damage Q*bert's reputation than anything the march of time could have possibly achieved. Q*bert: Rebooted comes with some extra content, but not a whole lot. The game includes Q*bert classic, if you're pining for a trip down memory lane, or if you're curious to gaze upon the 30-plus-year-old relic. But again, those controls, those awful controls, swiftly prevent you from enjoying the game for long. It's especially bad since Q*bert classic only allows for diagonal controls, and it's usually up in the air whether or not the game will read the correct inputs--in fact, it's even worse in some ways. Gems collected in the Rebooted portion of the game can be exchanged for skins. These are strictly aesthetic changes, so don't expect the Q*zard skin to bring any needed magic to the fold. You can also unlock Q*nicorn, who leaves a trailing rainbow in his wake, or the < Terminator-inspired Q*1000. Just note that some of the skins come with their own special audio, so you may want to choose your skin with care. The Q*1000, for example, sounds like slapping pieces of metal at every hop, while Q*knight is more akin to the sound of someone kicking a metal trashcan down a long flight of tall stairs. Not surprisingly, the game has other issues. Most levels are not all that challenging to complete, yet there is the occasional difficulty spike that pops up from nowhere just to make sure you're still paying attention. Some graphics, such as words, are heavily pixelated, and there is one starry background that doesn't quite stretch all the way across a wide screen. All of the above stand as constant reminders to Rebooted's origin as a mobile game. The animation for Q*bert is surprisingly smooth, however, but that degree of care isn't shared among his enemies. Coily the snake is easily the worst, as his barely passable animation makes it hard to tell if he's getting ready to jump or just wiggle a bit. Levels near the end of the game also get incredibly difficult, especially thanks to one new enemy, Uppercut, a giant boxing glove that bops you away if you get too close. The problem was that I could never figure out what direction it would send me, though most of the time it just knocked me out of the level. One such level finally took too much, and after nearly 20 attempts, I gave up. I was done. Oh, have I mentioned the music? It's bad. And it loops. I ended up muting the game after a few hours. Not every great video game icon should get a reboot, but I feel that Q*bert is one of few who has earned a second chance. So a game like Q*bert: Rebooted, which takes a tepid approach to the need to take risks in order to refresh a classic formula, saddens me. Even if the game featured stable controls, the overall package is still mediocre at best. But with the bad controls, compounded by lackadaisical graphics and boring gameplay, Q*bert: Rebooted never had the potential to shine anyway. Q*bert, old friend, you deserve better. "
2562,Madden NFL 13,6.0,1,"Madden NFL 12, the lone NFL game for Sony's powerful portable features almost none of the tweaks that have been implemented in this year's console releases. Because the core mechanics are solid, it's still a decent way to simulate a real NFL season while on the go, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that you've played this exact game before. And when you factor in plentiful performance issues, Madden NFL 13 for the Vita can't even live up to the standard set by the year-old game it's trying to emulate.        First, the good news: while this game cribs from 2012's console game, that game's lame commentary from Cris Collinsworth and Gus Johnson has been replaced. Jim Nantz and Phil Simms of CBS take over the play-calling duties. They have a tendency to repeat favorite phrases and clam up for interminably long stretches, but they are much better than the team that made you reach for the mute button last year. Hearing Nantz open each game with his welcoming ""Hello, friends"" line makes it feel like it's Sunday afternoon, and there's nice back-and-forth discussion at times. Commentating still has a long way to go to replicate the real sport, especially when it comes to how instant replays are handled, but this is a step in the right direction.     Sadly, just about every other aspect of Madden NFL 13 is a direct copy of Madden 12. In some ways, this is a good thing. The core mechanics make for an enjoyable game of football, and that holds true on the Vita. Beating the left tackle to sack the quarterback on a key third down is incredibly rewarding, as is fooling the defense with a well-executed draw when they're expecting a pass. With dozens of plays to choose from, competitive contests become intricate chess matches where outsmarting your opponents is just as important as outplaying them. If you know your friend loves to roll right on long passes, a cornerback blitz can shake things up; just cross your fingers that he didn't guess your move.     As much fun as it can be to pull off a last-second victory, the Vita version is plagued with serious performance issues. The game jerks when moving from replays back to live action, and that disruption happens with such frequency that it can be nauseating. This choppiness isn't limited to noninteractive moments, either. The action may freeze for a split second right when you're looking to unload the ball or deliver a crushing hit, and that hiccup could be the difference between a huge gain and a crushing turnover. Menus also suffer from lag. Just navigating to different modes or trying to substitute players mid-game wears your patience thin because there's a brief delay between your press and the game's response.        If you can deal with stuttering performance, the touch-screen controls do add a dose of novelty to an otherwise lackadaisical outing. Tapping a defensive player automatically gives you control of him. This may sound like a small feature, but it's quite handy if you control different defensive players on every down. Receiver routes can also be drawn before you snap the ball. Smart tweaks like these don't have a huge impact on the action, but they do make it easier to pull off the specific play you have in mind. The other notable Vita-exclusive control tweak comes in how kicks are aimed. By tilting the system, you can kick the ball to various parts of the field. This is logical in theory, but in practice, it makes kicking harder than it should be. Because the Vita is a portable system and can be jostled easily, you may find yourself aiming way off the mark at the last second.     For the most part, the Vita controls feel natural, but it's clear that other areas weren't given the same attention. One element you always expect sports games to update from one year to the next is the statistics, but Madden NFL 13 fails in that regard. Teams sport their records from the 2010 season. For instance, the 49ers were an impressive 13-3 last season, and that's what should be reflected in the game, but when you scroll through the teams, you see a dismal 6-10 mark. Thankfully, the attributes of the players line up with reality, but that doesn't excuse such obvious problems making it to the final product.     This inattention to detail is emblematic of the Madden NFL 13 experience. Aside from new commentary and a few Vita-specific controls, this is the same basic game that Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners played last year, only with a choppy frame rate dragging the core action down. In the console version of Madden 13, Connected Careers combined Franchise and Superstar modes into one cohesive package, but on the Vita, the new mode is nowhere to be found. Madden NFL 13 is certainly a disappointment, but Vita fans looking for a portable football game can still find enjoyment here.  "
4047,WarJetz,5.0,1,"As the follow-up to World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks, 3DO's WarJetz brings mayhem to the skies in a no-holds-barred dog-fighting competition. As the member of a cutthroat gang, you'll blast rival pilots and collect major ""bux"" en route to your own personal shot at the WDL championship. In addition to the wacky premise, five two-player modes, eight aircraft, 28 different arenas, and a lengthy single-player campaign, the game offers nearly unlimited hours of enjoyment--if only the game itself were as good as its options. First and foremost, the flight system in this version of WarJetz is far more complicated than it needs to be, which is remarkable considering that it has even fewer flight controls than the PS2 port. The D-pad adjusts bank and pitch, while the L2 and R2 buttons adjust throttle speed. The X and circle buttons fire your aircraft's primary and secondary weapons, while the square and triangle buttons cycle through the available weapons list. For some reason, the strafing/bombing toggle and ECM countermeasures are bound to the L1 and R2 buttons, which makes it quite easy to confuse them with the throttle controls or just forget them altogether. Either possibility is equally common, especially since steering response is so oversensitive that you'll usually be too busy veering away from walls to ever swap targeting styles or fire ECMs. If you can acclimate to the Quasimodo-style controls, WarJetz's underlying gameplay is mostly pleasurable. Each aircraft offers two methods of targeting--strafing and bombing--as well as a variety of basic and advanced weapon types, such as machine guns, lasers, missiles, and cluster bombs. Power-ups, such as shields, health, afterburners, nukes, and weapon upgrades, also litter the landscape for your benefit. Since it costs money to replace an aircraft that's been shot down, keeping a watchful eye on your armor meter and snagging those health upgrades is a wise strategy. Oddly enough, there are no options for barrel rolls, 180-degree turns, or loops--three features that exemplified the PlayStation 2 release and are often common in the majority of 3D combat shooters. Control issues and gameplay omissions aside, WarJetz's worst feature is its visuals. Although arenas are located in snowy, dilapidated, or dangerous postapocalyptic locations, they aren't very large or well populated, which greatly limits the amount of excitement you'll glean from property damage. On top of that, the fog and draw-in line are so close that you never really get a chance to enjoy the scenery, especially since hills, buildings, and enemy aircraft pop in as if magically summoned from the land of make-believe. The game's lone bright spot is the aircraft models, which are large, highly detailed contraptions with all sorts of nifty smoke trails, light sources, and explosion effects. All in all, the majority of solo pilot wannabes will want to avoid WarJetz. Those looking for a fun, albeit somewhat flawed, two-player dog-fighting game may sing a different tune, however, as the game's forgiving physics and plentiful mode choices make it a good choice for casual weekend competition."
3038,Ultra Street Fighter IV,8.0,2,"Street Fighter IV, one of the best fighting games to be released this side of the 21st century. Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition--which comes as either a standalone package or as a downloadable update to existing versions of Super Street Fighter IV--is the latest iteration of the game, adding four new characters, tweaking the online experience, and introducing a raft of character balance changes. For Street Fighter IV fanatics and competitive online players, Arcade Edition is essential, because its additions make it the most complete and well-rounded version of what was already an excellent brawler. For everyone else, Arcade Edition's core-focused changes won't add too much to the experience you're already having with last year's Super Street Fighter IV, so it's a version you can safely skip with the knowledge that you're not missing out on too much.        With Super Street Fighter IV, Capcom made some significant changes to the original, adding in 10 new characters and selectable ultras, as well as overhauling the game's online features. Arcade Edition isn't as ambitious in scope, so the game feels and plays much like its predecessor. (Check out our full review of Super Street Fighter IV). The most apparent additions are the four new characters Arcade Edition brings, bringing the game's total roster up to 39 fighters. Street Fighter III veterans Yun and Yang skateboard and rollerblade their way back in (respectively), while Ryu gets a villainous makeover as Evil Ryu. The last new character slot is filled by Oni, an even nastier version of Akuma.     While Yun and Yang might superficially look and play similarly, the only thing they truly share is their similar rushdown style of offence. Both characters are effective for getting into an opponent's face and pressuring with fast strikes. For players not used to Yun and Yang's aggression, they can be tricky to fight against (particularly online, where the twins have become favorites). Evil Ryu plays like a mix of Ryu and Akuma, with additional moves like an Akuma-like teleport and a wicked axe-kick. Oni, on the other hand, is a mixture of Akuma and Gouken, sporting a ridiculous number of projectile attacks and easy combo potential. Both of the dark hado characters also pack a mean punch, dishing out high damage and making them dangerous characters in expert hands. The trade-off, however, is low health. In fact, all four of the new character's offensive strengths are balanced out by relatively less staying power, particularly Evil Ryu and Oni.      Because Evil Ryu and Oni are essentially souped-up versions of characters like Ken, Ryu, Sagat, and others, Yun and Yang are the most interesting additions to the roster. Those wanting to brush up their skills on the newcomers, however, might find the early going tough because none of the new characters have been incorporated into the game's Challenge mode. Challenge mode--a series of trials set for each character that effectively taught players different combos--was the best way to get to grips with an unfamiliar fighter in the previous incarnations of Street Fighter IV, given the paucity of other training options within the game. Without challenges for the four additions, you'll have to look elsewhere for advanced tips on how to improve your game.         As for the other 35 fighters on the roster, they've all experienced some changes as part of an overall tweaking of the game's balance. Some of the changes are quite noticeable (Akuma and Ryu's air hurricane kick, for example, has had its jump arc modified to make it tougher to run away with, while Guile's flash kick damage has been nerfed), while most have had subtler tweaks made to attack damage, recovery, hit boxes, or frame counts. The majority of these changes only really affect high-level play, and for casual or moderate players, their favorite characters will still handle much as they have previously, and the overall gameplay experience will feel very similar to Super Street Fighter IV.      Unlike vanilla Street Fighter IV and its Super incarnation, online play between Super Street Fighter IV and Arcade Edition is not mutually exclusive. In Arcade Edition, you can choose to either play other Arcade or Super players online, with the game letting you choose which version to look for (Super owners, however, won't be able to play you online if you're set to Arcade Edition). ""Downgrading"" to Super will also turn off the balancing that Arcade Edition introduces, which could be a handy fallback if you're not happy with how your favorite character has been changed. Online play is seamless, with only matches with players from the other side of the world experiencing any sort of lag.     Arcade Edition comes in two flavors--either as a download via the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live to upgrade an existing Super Street Fighter IV copy or as a budget-priced retail box that includes the entire game. For Super owners, Arcade Edition isn't a dramatic overhaul of the game, and its worth really depends on how competitive you want to stay when playing online. But for those who haven't picked up Street Fighter IV, the low price point of the boxed version of Arcade Edition makes it a great entry point into this outstanding fighting game. Street Fighter IV is a tight, fun, and competitive brawler with a healthy online community, and Arcade Edition is the most complete and comprehensive version of it yet.  "
2051,TxK,8.0,2,"  If you've somehow avoided Tempest over the last few decades, its basics are simple: Your ship sits at the top of a plane (traditionally cone-like, though TxK also features flattened, curved, and jagged shapes), with enemies coming up to get you from below. You want to destroy them before they reach you, because they attempt to grab you and pull you down into the abyss from whence they came--unless they simply blow you up first. At the start of every short level, you are limited to basic movement (left and right along the plane) and shooting, as well as a single smart bomb, dubbed the supertapper (like Tempest's superzapper), which blows up all enemies onscreen. Holding the L button locks you in place and allows you to ""lean"" into the lane to your right or left, which can be useful for destroying enemies while simultaneously dodging projectiles. By collecting power-ups that come toward you along with the enemies, you can upgrade your weapon speed, earn an AI drone to fight alongside you, and, perhaps most importantly, gain the ability to jump, allowing you to dodge many would-be fatal enemy encounters. But when the level ends, all those upgrades are gone, and you start from scratch again, with a single smart bomb and little else. When the action ramps up, all of this can become hard to follow. The visuals are beautiful, but busy, mimicking the simple vector graphics of the original Tempest while throwing a lot more psychedelic effects, colors, and general noise onto the screen at once. This includes seemingly unrelated bits of text on occasion, so using a smart bomb might mean the phrase ""Eat your vegetables"" is thrown in your face for a split second. Why? Who knows. While the quirkiness has some charm, it can be one of TxK's faults. In later levels especially, there is so much happening at once that the visuals are overwhelming to the point of being disorienting, and it can be frustrating when the screen is so cluttered that you fail to see what kills you when you lose a life. In an effort to ramp up the difficulty, some levels not only twist and fold into each other, but also start twisting and turning as you're trying to play. With so much happening onscreen, it becomes very easy to lose track of where you are and what direction you're moving in. That said, TxK's difficulty curve is sufficiently gradual, allowing you to improve your skills without even realizing it. You forget just how much easier the first 10 levels are compared to the final 10 until you go back and play them. And you will want to go back sometimes. Unless you're playing either Pure mode (seeing how far you can get starting at level one) or Survival mode (also starting at level one, but with extra lives and bonus levels disabled), you can freely select any level you've unlocked. But TxK takes replaying older levels one clever step further than most arcade games. You don't save your progress, nor do you simply have the option of starting a new game from the highest level you've reached. Instead, anytime you select a level above level one, you begin with the highest score and highest number of lives that you've ever had upon reaching that level previously.   The sound is as amazing a mix of old and new as the visuals and design. Catchy techno beats underscore different groups of levels with intriguing vocal sound samples sprinkled throughout, one of which sounds as if it were taken from a news story about old game consoles. Meanwhile, many of the effects you hear as you play sound like they were ripped straight out of other arcade and Atari classics (the jump sound, for instance, might be straight out of Pitfall). "
1864,Minimum,6.0,1,"As the shooter genre aged, it began to reach toward other genres for inspiration. Bending shooting with the statistics and upgrades of a role playing game became a popular option, but what would happen if a third-person shooter was merged with a multiplayer online battle arena, or MOBA, spiced up with a dash of striking minimalistic graphics? The result would be Minimum, a multiplayer shooter that takes cues from the MOBA playbook without copying the design outright. Minimum features impressive maps, charming and clean aesthetics, and superb, high-octane gameplay that manages to keep your pulse pounding after many hours. However, a host of glitches constantly pester, threatening to replace any moment of joy with sheer frustration.           Minimum is still far from finished, and it shows. Menu screens flicker, and occasionally you load into a match frozen for several seconds as environmental objects pop into view. Horde mode's follow cam is nauseating, as it smacks into objects surrounding the player in focus. Worst of all, however, are the shockingly frequent game crashes. During my first four hours into the game, Minimum crashed once per hour, forcing me to restart my computer. Oddly, the crashes only seemed to occur while I was either trying to quit the game or navigate the menu; the problem never cropped up while I was in a game. Minimum is due to receive updates in the forms of new weapons, armor pieces, and maps, but given its current state, I'd rather see the glitches and game-ending bugs ironed out before getting a new toy or two. Minimum is a game of incredible moments. Watching an enormous titan, its form taking after a sumo wrestler, lifting another titan, designed after a samurai, straight into the night sky and tossing it into a cliff is awe-inspiring. More than a dozen hours in and my heart still flutters at the sight enemy titan marching along to a slow, thumping soundtrack. Titan mode manages to be both recognizable and fresh, while featuring some incredible maps in which to blow your opponents away. Minimum can be something special, but the unfortunate distractions, such as watching your computer boot up for the umpteenth time thanks to another crash, keep it from reaching its goals. With a few tweaks and perhaps some extra building blocks, Minimum can, like the imposing titans that call it home, stand tall among its peers."
661,Night Call,8.0,2,"You play as Houssine, an Algerian immigrant living in Paris. Much of his background is elided, or only revealed in suggestion over the course of the game, but he is Muslim, sports a thick, dark beard, and works as a cab driver on the night shift. Houssine is recently back behind the wheel after an assault that saw him hospitalized and, because of who he is, a suspect in the very crime of which he was a victim.Houssine understands what it means to feel like an outsider. There's been a terrorist attack recently, the details of which remain unspecified, but Arab men like Houssine are singled out for suspicion, their mere presence a cause for concern. His assault also resulted in the death of another person, the latest in a series of deaths that the police are keen to pin on him. One detective, however, disagrees and offers Houssine a deal: Help her investigation into the murders and he'll walk free.It feels right that Houssine would be of interest to the police given the political climate (both current and echoed in-game) and the hints at his troubled past. And it feels authentic that someone would pressure him to essentially become an informant, the kind of blackmail that insinuates that inside the moral grey area of society lies a corrupt, black core. These themes--of feeling like you don’t belong, of a rotten system operating to exclude all but the privileged few--infuse not just Houssine’s personal experience but of many of the people he encounters, and work well in linking together an otherwise disparate collection of stories. At one point a young black man from Chicago (he’s in Paris studying to become a mime, hilariously) gets into Houssine’s cab after a humiliating run-in with the police, and they bond over their shared experiences. “I’d say the police have a problem with black people,” Houssine says, then grins, “... and Arabs.”Each night, Houssine hits the streets to track down clues and follow up leads, all while performing his regular job. From a map of the city, you select a fare to take and watch a yellow arrow navigate to its destination, the scene then overlaying an interior shot of the cab with Houssine front right and his passenger(s) in the back seat behind.At this point, the only thing to do is talk. Conversations are entirely text-based, with you selecting dialogue options on Houssine's behalf interspersed with his internal observations. Despite being minimally animated, with a handful of poses and expressions each, each character conveys a remarkable range of emotion and succeeds in bringing to vivid life each new person you encounter.It's a wonderfully diverse cast of characters, too. In total there are 75 passengers to meet over the course of the game, drawn from a broad range of ages, social classes, ethnicities, sexualities and, in one or possibly two cases, dimensions. They each have their own stories to tell, and Houssine seems to be the man chosen to hear them all.That's because while he's an outsider, as a cab driver, Houssine's difference is camouflaged. Many of the people he picks up are oblivious to him, at least at first. Couples discuss private matters as if he is not there. Lone passengers mutter to themselves, seemingly unaware of the possibility there's a real human being sharing the vehicle with them. When they do notice him, one passenger scoffs at the idea that a lowly cab driver could have any useful advice. Another passenger assumes Houssine has certain political sympathies because he's a brown, working-class man. ""According to the people of this country, you don't count,"" one character tells him, with weary resignation. Houssine is both othered and unseen, tagged as different and yet simultaneously erased.However, some passengers are immediately warm towards Houssine, while others, if distant or cautious to begin with, soon find themselves disarmed. Regardless of their disposition, however, they're all willing to reveal the most intimate details of their inner lives with often only the slightest bit of delicate prodding. There's the politician who is at the end of his tether over endemic corruption and pleads with Houssine to help him leak confidential documents. There's the lesbian couple who are loudly debating the merits of the prospective sperm donor with whom they have just concluded a ""date."" There's the former porn actress who is eager to talk all about her new pro-union production company making gender-positive porn movies. These tales are often funny, moving, and sweet--but moreover, they're always fascinating and exceptionally well-written.In between these fares, Houssine can visit various locations to further his investigation. He knows someone who works somewhere who might have some information, that sort of thing. But these scenes don't feel as fleshed out as the cab ride conversations. It's not made clear how Houssine knows to go to these places or why many of these contacts are able to help him. Indeed, much of the casework he's pursuing is obscured, as if key details have been intentionally, frustratingly, left out of reach. When Houssine returns to his apartment each morning and assesses the clues he’s uncovered--presented as hand-written notes pinned to a board--I found it difficult to interpret what much of it meant. By the time Houssine was called upon to accuse a suspect, I made an unconvincing guess that just happened to be correct.The structure of this series of murder mysteries is strange. There are three cases to choose from when you begin a new game, and each is framed the same way: Houssine finds himself the inadvertent victim of a serial killer and strong-armed by a detective to assist the investigation. Recurring characters populate each case, though if you meet someone in one case, that relationship won't carry over into the next one. It was very odd to give a ride in the second case to the very same person I'd revealed as the killer in the first. I did learn some more things about him that complicated my feelings about how the first case was resolved, but I couldn’t help but wish I’d encountered this conversation while pursuing that first case.Houssine can't just focus on his detective work. He needs to earn a living, too. Fuel for your cab, daily car maintenance, and repayments on your cab license are all a drain on your bank account that can only be plugged by picking up new fares. Your boss says you're like a son to him, but if you don't make enough money from your shift and can't afford to pay his cut, the car maintenance, and the license fee, he fires you on the spot and it's game over.I like the theory behind this slight economic sim layer. It's there to ensure you feel the precariousness of Houssine's existence while also nudging you towards interacting with all the characters who don't really have anything to do with the core mystery. But my experience of the normal difficulty setting was that it felt too punitive. On my first case, I entered an all-too-real downward spiral where I simply couldn't pull Houssine out of the red and had to abandon the game. On the easy difficulty, Houssine still loses money each night, but he starts with a buffer sufficient to see the story through.If you're going to play Night Call, then play it on the ""Story"" setting. The normal difficulty claims it is ""the way Night Call is meant to be played."" I disagree. Night Call is at its best when you're behind the wheel, gliding through the rain-kissed boulevards, lost in conversation with whichever lost soul just happened to appear in the back seat of your cab. It presents itself as a noir mystery, but the murders you’re investigating are the least interesting narrative element. Night Call’s real strength is in the stories it tells about Paris, about the people who live there and the meaningful connections you can have with them no matter how brief or unexpected. It's these people you'll remember once you've solved each case, not the fares you charged them."
2408,Strike Suit Infinity,8.0,2,"Strike Suit Zero, the space-mech combat game that was released back in January. Its fast-paced battles were beautifully rendered, and a bit unbalanced at times, but Zero offered just the right mix of arcade-inspired action and intergalactic vistas to keep things interesting through to the end. Sadly, for a $20 game, there simply wasn’t enough variety in the action or mission structure. For Infinity, developer Born Ready Games stripped the Strike Suit experience down to its core mechanics, offering a stand-alone horde mode for $7. It’s a smart move; the most redeeming quality of Zero was its gameplay, after all. While it’s good to see a game embrace its strengths so wholeheartedly, there are a myriad of smaller issues that hold Infinity back from greatness, despite its improved value.       Your task couldn’t be more straightforward: survive and defeat waves of enemy combatants. In your transforming jet mech strike suit, you fly through outer space, whittling away at opposing spacecraft with energy cannons, lock-on missiles, and thousands of rounds of smaller munitions. Collect enough flux by defeating enemies, and you can transform into the strike suit’s bipedal form, which brings increased firepower and defense. Each round is a heady mix of speed, explosions, and tense face-offs, the culmination of which makes Strike Suit Infinity a captivating and challenging experience.       Survival is often difficult, since each round of waves pummels you with denser enemy formations and increasingly more powerful ships, but chasing the top of the online leaderboards is the ultimate challenge in Infinity. Even though it may seem impossible to leave your mark on the overall leaderboard, you can also compete for the per-round leaderboards, challenging previously defeated rounds a la carte.     Before the start of a round, you’re given hints about the types of enemies you’ll face in the waves to come, and what weapons might be most effective, but it takes more than a little advanced knowledge to come out on top. Strike Suit Infinity rewards fast reflexes and experience, and the room for skill development is impressive, with the top ranked players hitting scores 100 times larger than your own in some cases. Reaching that same high level of play seems insurmountable, but every defeat leads to new lessons and a better understanding of what you must do to prevail.        Of course, you must first overcome the strike suit’s complex capabilities. To be able to accelerate, brake, maneuver, transform, fire weapons, avoid enemy fire, and deploy a missile-scrambling EMP burst in a matter of a couple of seconds requires some serious coordination. Thankfully, the controls are comprehensive and responsive, leaving little to be desired in the way of mech management once they sink in. When dialed in during the heat of battle, good players will be able to handle most things thrown their way. The difference between a good and a great player, however, is the ability to earn score multipliers, effectively manage resources, and locate the fleeting and hard-to-locate upgrades, hidden in relatively far off transports and freighters.     Aiding you on your mission are ally squads, purchased with credits earned during the previous rounds. While not so important at the start, it’s critical that you manage your fleet, and thus your pool of credits, during later rounds against frigates, mine layers, and the infamous Black Fleet. Squads are defined by their class, which range from nimble Interceptors to Heavy Fighters and Bombers. Instead of picking up new recruits, you may choose to spend credits to level up your entire team, but it’s entirely unclear what aspects get upgraded in the process. Do your ships gain speed? Does their AI improve? You don’t know, because the game doesn’t tell you. The same goes for the upgrades that you earn for your strike suits; +2 to armor sounds good on paper, but it’s impossible to quantify what that actually means.     Apart from introducing the simple joys of arcade-like skill progression, Strike Suit Infinity also features the Marauder and Raptor strike suits, the latest DLC add-ons for Strike Suit Zero. Their qualities vary in the typical way: the Marauder has increased firepower and shield ratings at the cost of speed, while the opposite is true for the Raptor. They’re interesting diversions that prove to be distinct in practice, providing a simple means of mixing up the dynamics of conflict. What would cost $2.99 to add into Strike Suit Zero is available in Infinity from the start, a fact that may mean little to newcomers, but might prove enticing to existing owners of Zero who have yet to purchase the DLC. The differences between the three strike suits may not be tailored for use during specific rounds, but when roadblocked by a difficult round, switching suits is a fast and dirty way of alternating your approach.       There are nagging imperfections in the game’s upgrade system that can be demotivating when budgeting credits, but the omission of specific numbers doesn’t tarnish the joys of combat. Strike Suit Zero cost a comparatively hefty sum for its somewhat brief campaign, but Infinity could take months to master, at a fraction of the cost. It’s unfortunate for strike suit veterans that Infinity isn’t available as an add-on to Zero, but as a stand-alone game, it’s an excellent slice of mech combat presented under the guise of an old-school arcade game; bonus rounds and all.  "
4030,Dino Stalker,5.0,1,"While it has garnered little love from critics and gamers, Capcom's Gun Survivor light-gun series has soldiered on and is now on its third installment. Dino Stalker, known as Gun Survivor 3: Dino Crisis in Japan, strays from the usual light-gun formula in an attempt to offer a unique light-gun shooting experience. But it falls markedly short, and the end result is a frustrating mess of a game.   The premise behind Dino Stalker is bizarre and convoluted, involving time-traveling dinosaurs, a World War II fighter pilot, and not a lot of coherence. The good news is that the story is there just to move you from location to location, so you can get down to the business of shooting lots and lots of dinosaurs. Dino Stalker, for the most part, plays like any other post-Time Crisis light-gun game: You'll move from one end of a level to the other, wasting enemies and picking up the occasional health pack or weapon upgrade. The key difference here is that the camera movement isn't on rails, so you are charged with both moving around the levels as well as taking out dinosaurs.   The game offers several different ways to go about your dinosaur stalking. You can play with the GunCon 2 light gun, using the D-pad on the back of the gun to move around, but using a single hand to move and shoot is difficult and will wear out your arm more quickly than your average light-gun game. Alternately, you can play with the standard Dual Shock 2 controller, but the targeting reticle is far too sensitive, and you'll often find yourself dealing with bouts of overcorrection while trying to draw a bead on a dino. The third and best option utilizes the Dual Shock 2 and the GunCon 2 in tandem, mapping movement controls to the D-pad on the Dual Shock 2 and leaving the GunCon 2 strictly for shooting. But even this configuration does not compensate completely for the game's inherently slow movement or the inability to look up or down, and you'll spend an equal amount of time fighting the controls as you will fighting dinosaurs.   Dino Stalker isn't exactly one of the best-looking PlayStation 2 games available; in fact, the game doesn't even stand up to most of the games in the PlayStation 2 light-gun game subcategory. The textures are very hit-and-miss, usually erring toward the blurry side. The world geometry is fairly simple, but even though it's not pushing that many polygons, the game still has a very noticeable draw distance and some occasional slowdown. The dinosaurs themselves are the most refined aspect of the game's presentation, with good modeling and decent animations, but they, along with the rest of the game, suffer from some pretty serious aliasing. You'll be treated to prerendered cutscenes in between levels, but these usually look like they could've been rendered by the PlayStation 2 on its own. The sound design in Dino Stalker is equally unimpressive, consisting of decent gunfire sounds, a small handful of dinosaur shrieks, and an anonymous and altogether forgettable adventure soundtrack. Really, the only sound that sticks out in Dino Stalker is the ""reload"" command you'll hear whenever you're out of bullets, and this is only because the computer voice noticeably mispronounces it.   Though the game doesn't really excel in any one facet of its design, Dino Stalker would have been infinitely more playable had Capcom discarded the Gun Survivor control scheme and just left the movement control on rails, like all other light-gun games. But with its needlessly frustrating control scheme intact, Dino Stalker's appeal is incredibly limited. Though the game is loosely affiliated with the Dino Crisis games, there's not a lot here to draw fans of that series, and with several superior light-gun games available on the PlayStation 2, there's little reason for anyone without a masochistic streak to play this game.

1999,Arma 3,7.0,2," But what's to be said for the wisdom of appending a campaign mode to a game that has traditionally been appreciated as a multiplayer creative suite? There's a blunder for the modern era. The Arma series is known foremost as a platform: a malleable assembly of characters and military objects, and rules to govern their behavior. Modding enthusiasts leverage in-game editors and a relatively ungated code structure to produce their own playable content in lieu of formal designs, and to great effect. It was odd, then, to see some lamenting the relegation of Arma III's campaign to three downloadable post-release entries. There's a stubborn canard that asserts a video game's single-player campaign, if offered, must be its nominal flagship, even when in practice it's a secondary (or tertiary) concern for player and developer alike. But a campaign was promised, and so a campaign must be delivered. NATO forces are in the midst of a drawdown on the island of Stratis, when the once-friendly local forces lash out in a surprise attack. A multistage affair ensues, playing out in a dull triptych: Survive. Adapt. Win. The grunt tasked with doing that surviving, adapting, and winning is one Corporal Kerry, who reacts to every order he's given with a beleaguered protest (""You want me to do what??""), which is a curious trait for a soldier with a non-zero amount of experience. You, as Kerry, take on an escalating part in an escalating war, eventually graduating from a follower role on Stratis' meager 20 square kilometers to commanding a squad on Altis and its staggering 270 square kilometers. There are a few vague allusions to an overarching plot involving a British black-ops group and some suspicious earthquakes, but neither plot point stakes much of a claim on the proceedings. The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty. This is the sort of conflict where acronyms (NATO, FIA) fight acronyms (CSAT, AAF) over acronyms (LZs, OPs). But it's also the sort where trite wartime quotes fill the interstitial screens, and where the only attempt to characterize the enemy force is an epithet--""greenback""--that's occasionally spat. Arma III is content to let you idle while an ally goes through a lengthy, inaudible, and ultimately inconsequential discussion with a checkpoint guard, or direct you to report in to characters whose only purpose is to refer you over to talk to your commanding officer a few yards away. It restricts your character's movement speed to a controlled jog--elbows in, gun stock squarely nestled on the shoulder--and sends you humping across the hills and valleys of Altis for miles without encountering anything worth loosing a round at. Then an electric guitar wails, a bomber starts strafing your position, and you're forced to bug out at the same ponderous pace that you entered with seconds ago.  Dark Souls, and that game's motto is ""Prepare to Die."" I'd hop off five-foot-tall ledges and crumple into a bloody heap. I'd get gunned down while looking at the full screen map, after being prompted to look at the map. I'd open up the help menu for instructions on some trial-by-fire task, and get killed while reading them. I'd succumb to razor-accurate shots fired by enemies in distant hills, enemies who never seemed to have a scope on their guns when I eventually overcame them. Some of these instances were learning experiences, and not soon repeated. Others felt like side effects of the campaign's delay and piecemeal release schedule--what Arma veteran would have welcomed a long-awaited mode that leads with a thorough introduction to controls he or she is already familiar with? The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty. Arma III uses the full keyboard for its array of possible actions, split between personal affairs like toggling flashlights and binoculars, and issuing orders to your squad. Much of the heavy lifting is foisted on the mousewheel, of all things, which scrolls through contextual actions for almost anything that's to be done in the game. The controls alternate between instrumental and overly finicky, but they never cease to be an aspect of Arma III that requires constant attention. The unwieldiness does lend combat a certain gravitas, however. Most modern shooters grant an athletic flourish to the act of killing; here, the satisfaction of downing an enemy comes from the knowledge that he won't be shooting at you anymore, not in how adroitly you head-shotted him. There isn't such a positive spin to be put on Arma III's artificial intelligence, however. It's particularly damning, because the strategic underpinnings require a close coordination with squadmates that the game's engine isn't prepared to give. Teammates follow commands at their leisure, if they follow them at all. During one marathon trek across the island, I reached my destination with only two of my eight-man squad in tow. Looking back from the top of our hilltop destination, I could chart the lost squad members like dropped breadcrumbs--one trapped on a rock, four frozen solid in the middle of a field, and the last determined never to leave the two-story building he'd wandered into of his own volition. All attempts to order a regroup returned a chorus of firm but vexing ""Negative."" So much for ""no man gets left behind,"" then. Though Arma III's campaign may be a bit of a dud, the rest of the game remains more than capable of carrying a payload. There are the packaged showcases, which are one-off missions that introduce the game's more varied weapons, vehicles, and techniques in isolation. There's a firing range that offers a bit of shooting gallery-style diversion. What's of more significance is the multiplayer, which bolsters the mission-running experience by supplanting the artificial intelligence with human allies that need less babysitting. They aren't always any more helpful than the AI (and they're a tad more likely to frag you), but they're better company, and one good session is worth trawling the server browser for a little while. A capable human team can achieve the closest thing to agility that Arma III's punctilious controls allow, leapfrogging between bits of cover and sweeping buildings with a collective conscience. Better still is the library of mods, packed with thousands of player-created variants that run the gamut from atomic tests and rally races to fully-scripted missions and dynamic war simulations. You can take on a gauntlet of snipers, playing off the variable lines of sight that Altis' hills and valleys proffer. You can attempt a recreation of the real-life Neptune Spear mission that takes some curious artistic liberties. Chief among the offerings is Wasteland, a survivalist affair that highlights Arma III's talent for brooding, deliberate engagements, where discretion begins to really feel like the better part of valor. Or you could simply wander the islands, grabbing a few pictures to put alongside the towns, salt flats, and castles that litter the map's expansive topography. In any direction you go, there's loosely structured fun to be had. It's there where the islands Bohemia Interactive have created are put through their paces, stretched and warped by the collective whim of the internet, unconstrained by the expectations that burden the words ""modern warfare."""
2863,Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact,6.0,1,"   Ultimate Ninja Impact adapts the storyline of the most current Naruto anime series, Naruto Shippuden. In the Ultimate Road campaign, Naruto has returned to Hidden Leaf Village after three years of intense training to be reunited with many of his friends and comrades. However, his dear companion Sasuke, who has defected to serve the insidious Orochimaru, is not among them. Naruto learns of some pressing events happening in the village and elsewhere, and he immediately sets off with his teammates to try to set things right, only to get tied up in a much bigger plot that involves several different factions. The way the game adapts the story is admirable, though if you're already familiar with the way events play out (having read the comic or watched the show), there isn't much in the way of surprises.       The main game is divided into several chapters, each of which contains a map screen that allows Naruto and company to advance to various events and stages. By completing certain stages or objectives (some mandatory, some optional), new playable characters, missions, and special ability cards can be unlocked. Successfully completing levels and performing skillfully in battle also earns you ninja points, which allows you to purchase character-enhancing card pieces and upgrades, along with extras like music or wallpaper. Each chapter has a separate completion gauge that lets you know how much further you have to go before you've found and collected everything available. There's a lot of emphasis on collecting bonus goodies in Ultimate Ninja Impact, and this element of the game is well executed. Visuals and sound are also quite nice: The character models are faithful to the original designs and are surprisingly detailed. A heavy amount of voice-over also accompanies the story in both English and Japanese audio tracks.         The game features a few additional modes as well. Tag Battle lets you team up with either a computer-controlled companion or a friend (with his or her own PSP and copy of the game) to take on specially scripted missions for NP rewards, while Extra Missions offers more challenging single-player objectives to try to complete for additional rewards. (Given the game's typically lax difficulty, these missions are only slightly more taxing than your standard story fights.) You can use your full army of unlocked characters in these fights, which makes them the main place to play and level up favorite cast members that don't get much attention in the central plot.    "
3760,NBA 09 The Inside,5.0,1,"  NBA gaming enthusiasts are fortunate to have three simulation titles to choose from every year. The least prominent of the three basketball simulations on the market, Sony's NBA 09: The Inside is a progressive step from past installments in the series, though only slightly. The inclusion of The Life story mode and improved player models and presentation are welcome additions, but they're overshadowed by recurring clipping issues, a bare-bones franchise experience, and a lack of effective defensive controls.        While this game is classified as a simulation, the term only loosely applies to NBA 09 in comparison to competing NBA games. Too often the game will trap your player in an animation, removing him from your control. While this can be frustrating on offense, the defense has it far worse, because dribble moves and perimeter shooting are far too effective. Any player (we used Vladimir Radmanovic) can weave his way underneath the rim by using crossovers continuously, and players' field-goal percentages are excessively high. If that weren't enough, inaccurate physics continue to plague Sony's franchise. For instance, players seem to glide across the court, and ball magnetization is a common occurrence.     While some of the gameplay flaws can be attributed to bad physics, NBA 09's controls are to blame as well. The lack of a defensive lock-down mechanic makes staying in front of the ball handler an impossible task. This, coupled with the ineffectiveness of help defense, makes defense almost nonexistent. The result is that the game tempo is abnormally fast; even on the hardest difficulty passing is entirely optional, and it's commonplace to see dunks on nearly every possession. Although you'll never need to use it, play calling is severely limited, with only four options from which to choose, none of which are remarkably effective. For all the gameplay flaws, there are a few redeeming factors. The rebounding aid works very well in offsetting depth miscalculations resulting from the broadcast angle, and the skill-based shooting mechanic prevents you from feeling cheated on a missed shot.     The Life, the series' signature first-person storyline feature, makes its debut on the PlayStation 3. Now, in the fourth year since conception, The Life offers three separate storylines based on the position you choose to play (PG, SG/SF, and PF/C). Each story narrates your created player's progression from an NBA D-League unknown to a Finals MVP. Depicting experiences both on and off the court, the story's cutscenes feature voice-overs that capture the emotion of your character's ascension into the NBA, and the individual chapters serve as a teaching tool for how the position is played.      While the stories in The Life are compelling, the mode has major flaws that prevent it from reaching its potential. First, they are simply too short (each can be completed in just over an hour). Our career as a power forward included only nine chapters involving user interaction (the rest were cutscenes) and involved playing in only two basketball games: the D-league championship, where you play only the last 13 seconds, and Game 7 of the NBA Finals, where you play the last three minutes. The rest of your time is spent playing minigames. Overly rigid chapter objectives remove any element of spontaneity and essentially reward you for letting your opponent score so you can get the ball back faster. The lack of a player-lock feature (something that would fit well with a first-person storyline) is puzzling and leaves you feeling disconnected from your character. Improving attributes will help your created character in franchise mode, but it doesn't take long to max out many of the critical attributes, essentially making you a premier talent on your team at a bargain-basement price. It's possible to complete the power-forward storyline of The Life without improving a single attribute or buying any gear.        Franchise mode in NBA 09 is bare-bones by today's standards and lacks the basic presentation elements needed to make the mode viable. Trades can involve a maximum of two teams with up to four players and/or picks each. Although the trades are accurately governed by each franchise's current cap figure, these values are not displayed anywhere on the trade screen. Player evaluation during trades is equally cryptic since the game shows only the current season's stats and not the player's attributes. The game also doesn't include a trading block to field meaningful offers from the AI, and there isn't any way to monitor player moves made by other teams. Free-agent signing is skewed to your favor, because you will have first rights to sign any available player before the CPU-controlled teams. The list goes on and on. Suffice it to say that franchise enthusiasts would be better served by either of the competing NBA games.     In addition to Quick Play, The Life, and Franchise modes, NBA 09 includes a variety of minigames, ranging from NBA All-Star break skills and three-point competitions to more creative variations such as Blacktop Golf. Unfortunately, none of the minigames are particularly entertaining, and you probably won't play them more than once or twice. NBA Replay also returns this year, providing weekly challenges based on real games. Like in The Life, however, the objectives are too rigid and remove the spontaneity of the sport. NBA 09 also supports online play, but there are so few people playing that it's difficult to find a game.     The visuals in NBA 09 are superior to those in past games in the franchise, but they still fall short of the competition. The crowd is well lit, it dynamically reacts to on-court play, and it isn't just one model copied hundreds of times. Although player models (especially hair) seem more accurate than in last year's game, they are still not on par with those in either EA's or 2K's game. This is mostly due to the rubberlike skin textures, poor shadowing effects, and the occasional cross-eye. In addition to the models, the visual presentation is slightly improved this year. NBA 09 has switched to a sideline broadcast camera, and while it doesn't make playing defense any easier, it does make the game easier to follow, especially after turnovers. Player introductions at the start of the game somewhat resemble the real thing, though the lack of highlights is disappointing.        Ian Eagle does a reasonable job covering the game's play-by-play, but the color commentary from Kenny Smith is far too infrequent. As a result, the audio quickly begins to feel stale and almost unnecessary considering the frenzied pace at which the game is played.     NBA 09: The Inside is a small step in the right direction for a franchise that has typically lagged behind its NBA simulation counterparts. While implementation of a default broadcast camera angle and improved player models more closely mimic standards in the competition, glaring gameplay flaws and the overall lack of depth continue to hinder this series.

1437,Bombshell (2016),2.0,0,"The “broken” moniker is a tricky one in modern game publishing, of course. The bugs I encountered may be fixed by the time you read this review, but I can only review a game as provided, though I will give some benefit of the doubt to developer Interceptor Entertainment, which provided a list of bugs I am promised will be fixed by full release. The bugs that didn’t appear on that list are numerous, though, and as of this review’s publication, include a game-ending crash that still hinders me from reaching the finale. It’s possible you may not make it that far, however: the first main boss broke repeatedly when I played, finally working properly on the 6th attempt, and leaving me with no clue as to why it broke to begin with.Presuming that this boss bug is corrected by the time you play, you must still contend with the scene’s vast design flaws, the most pressing of which is that the battle is utterly lacking in challenge or excitement. You can beat the first two of the boss’s three forms with only minimal movement, due to the boss’s very limited, and very predictable, attacks; the third form you can beat when barely moving at all, as there are several safe zones the fiend’s poison attack cannot reach. It may seem odd to analyze a single boss fight before getting to the gameplay at large, but this boss stands as a fine testament to Bombshell’s badness; all of the issues that diminish this boss curse the game in its entirety.“Boring” is the most obvious of these issues, and one that pervades every aspect of Bombshell. Enemy behavior and level design are the biggest offenders in this regard. You navigate numerous stages on several cliched alien worlds (fire-themed, ice-themed, etc.), gunning down any enemy that comes between you and the generic mission objective at hand. That the levels take a good while to clear isn’t the biggest drawback, though it is a contributing factor to the tedium. Instead, it’s the sheer lack of variety in enemies and scenery that proves the game’s biggest downfall. You take aim at the same few alien types over and over again, and most of them run or amble towards you senselessly, sometimes falling from ledges or getting stuck behind obstacles--and occasionally just standing in place, raising their blades up and down but otherwise doing nothing. (You might get a good laugh out of leaving the area, and then returning to find the same alien perpetually slicing the air, at least.) There is no cleverness to the level layouts, enemy placement, or enemy mix, and there are few activities outside of combat to alleviate the monotony. The simplistic puzzles you encounter are hardly interesting or worthy of mention.So you shoot some aliens in unexciting, unchallenging encounters, then walk a little while through an ice level that looks just like the last ice level you played, which looked just like the level before that. Occasionally, you might think Bombshell is about to heat up, only for the game to douse the fun. For instance, execution prompts appear over enemies’ heads from time to time, though all too often, a prompt appears but doesn’t work, leading to a few sad seconds of impotent button-hammering. Successful executions are equally sad, however, focusing on the titular heroine’s lifeless animations as she rips off an alien’s head with the enthusiasm of a long yawn. Yet I must give credit where credit’s due: the weapons are fun to handle, and the flamethrower deserves a shout-out for being one of Bombshell’s few, explosive bright spots, along with the bowling mines that seek enemies to destroy, and roll back to you if they can’t find a mark.Elsewhere, successful artistry is uncommon, most notably in Bombshell’s excruciatingly awful writing.Environments reveal some artistic savvy, using an array of runes, crystals, and statues to show off how the Unreal 3-powered lighting beautifully glistens and refracts. Elsewhere, successful artistry is uncommon, most notably in Bombshell’s excruciatingly awful writing. It’s tempting to celebrate the arrival of any female game protagonist when they’re in such short supply, but please: hold your applause. Shelly, as she’s usually called, speaks only in the hoariest cliches and dumbest of jokes. “How many aliens does it take to change a light bulb? None. They’re all dead,” she says, all too often, until that alien horse is dead, beaten, buried, unburied, beaten, and buried again. “And they said that aliens would never land on the White House lawn.” Who said that, Shelly, and when?Perhaps this is Bombshell making a self-aware joke, poking fun at its participation in an old science-fiction cliche; Bombshell makes a number of references to its own failings along the way. Hanging a lampshade on dull fetch quests doesn’t make things better, however, and it sends a disrespectful message: Bombshell’s repetitiveness was a choice.I don’t like being disrespected--and I doubt you do, either. And yet it’s reasonable to feel that way when playing a buggy, bland game with some of the worst writing you’re likely to hear in some time. It doesn’t make a bad first impression, but that’s how it fools you: it shows you the Bombshell that could have been, only to disappoint you by becoming the bomb it soon becomes."
784,Underworld Ascendant,2.0,0,"Crowdfunded via Kickstarter and then signed by publisher 505 Games, Underworld Ascendant was first pitched as a spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld developed by a veteran team featuring several people who worked on the original, most notably its lead designer Paul Neurath.Unfortunately, far from a tribute to an influential classic, the result is both a crushing disappointment for Underworld fans and a genuinely bad game in its own right. Ascendant is riven with technical glitches. Every player-empowering feature is undone by a series of bafflingly ill-conceived design choices. And wherever you go your progress is constantly chafed by an all-pervading lack of refinement.The story, for what it's worth, tells an oblique tale of warring gods and carries only tenuous links to the original Underworld games. You play as a familiar chosen one burdened with the sole responsibility of saving the world from imminent catastrophe. The game's primary antagonist bellows his ghostly threats at the beginning of each new area as another hour ticks by on the doomsday clock, but it's all bluster. Nothing about the world feels imperiled until the game over screen descends and you're left feeling bemused rather than defeated.One of Ultima Underworld's great strengths was its sense of place. The Stygian Abyss of its subtitle was a multi-level, interconnected dungeon populated by diverse, warring tribes who observed what felt like distinct cultural practices. Ascendant's version of this is composed of seven discrete levels whose haphazard design (here's a swamp, inside a fort, inside a volcano) obliterates any suggestion of internal consistency and a huge but empty hub area that is so tiresome to traverse it becomes genuinely frustrating to return to between missions.Again unlike the original game, which let you wander freely throughout the dungeon and pick up quests from its inhabitants, Ascendant takes a more modern and compartmentalized approach. There's a job board in the hub from which you select one of four missions before you step through a portal to the relevant location. Critical path missions require you to find the abyssal key lost in each of the seven worlds, but other missions--each set by one of three factions with whom you can gain favor--may have you kill a particular enemy or collect a number of a specific item. You can only accept one mission at a time, however, so there's a lot of trekking back and forth between hub and dungeon level. And, oddly, any mission that asks you to collect items will ignore any of said items already in your possession and force you to collect fresh ones instead.None of the missions are complex and all ultimately boil down to entering the dungeon, fighting or sneaking your way to a certain spot, picking up or killing what you need, and legging it back to the nearest portal to warp to the hub. There are no NPCs to talk to, no conversations to have, no story choices to make, nothing but a bunch of what feel like procedurally-generated fetch quests delivered over and over again. If you recall the random quests given to you by the various Jarls throughout Skyrim, that's pretty much the entire game here--except repeated over seven static dungeon levels instead of spread across a whole seamless continent.The closest Ascendant comes to honoring Underworld's legacy is in how it affords players the ability to customize their playing style. During character creation, there is no choice of class as such, but once you begin earning ""memora"" you can purchase skills on a tree with three clusters of branches representing the typical Fighter, Mage, and Thief archetypes. Of course, you're free to mix and match these skills to tailor your character's strengths. Maybe you're an axe-wielding fighter who has also mastered healing magic? Or perhaps you'd rather dash from shadow to shadow and avoid enemies altogether?In a nice touch, spells aren't simply a replacement for weapons, but are better suited to the more cerebral player who wants to use the environment to their advantage. One spell lets you create a ball of fire, for example, but it's not a typical fireball that you hurl at an enemy; it's instead used to set other things on fire to, say, collapse the walkway that enemy was standing on, or more mundanely, burn down a fence that was blocking your way. The skill tree is flexible and allows you to craft a character that reflects the way you want to play, and leaves plenty of room to experiment with alternative play styles should you ever want to roll a new character.The chances of doing that are slim, sadly. Underworld Ascendant isn't just a bare-bones action-RPG, it's also full of bugs and glitches and carries a really weird save system. I've encountered glitches that I'd classify as trivial: frequent gaping, untextured holes in the world geometry; lines of dialogue repeating on loop until you leave the area; getting stuck momentarily on a staircase; struggling to get out of a knee-deep pool of water because the current is absurdly strong; standing too close to a chest when opening it and having the physics fling you across the room. These issues, and many more, I can cope with. They're irritating, sure, but they're not game-breaking.But the bugs become game-breaking when, for example, your character gets trapped between two bits of geometry and the only way out is to reload. Or when you can no longer use your bow even though you still have loads of arrows equipped. Or when you can actually use your bow and see the arrow shoot across the world but it seemingly passes right through the enemy without doing any damage. Or when an enemy spots you and simply runs into a corner and keeps trying to run through a wall while you attack it from behind until it dies. Or when you pull a lever and a rolling spike trap vanishes from the world but is still actually there and kills you. Or when an enemy gets caught in a cycle of jumping in the air and throwing a smoke bomb at its feet. These issues, and many more, are ones I can't cope with.But perhaps most crucially of all, I can't cope with the save system. To begin with, you cannot save wherever you like. You can save whenever you like, but loading this save will see you restart from the beginning of the level with your inventory intact but any changes to the level reset. You can, however, plant a tree sapling at certain points throughout a level to act as a respawn point if you die, similar to the Vita-Chambers in Bioshock. This would be okay if Underworld Ascendant was a run-based game where you're primarily interested in how far you can get and what loot drops. But it's not. It's a mission-based game where you're exploring a level for upwards of an hour each time, trying to complete a specific objective. You're already revisiting the same level over and over again by virtue of having to return to the hub to cash in a mission and pick up the next. Having to restart a level from the beginning each time you load a save is just adding insult to injury.For many players, especially the time-poor, the save system alone will be enough to render Underworld Ascendant unplayable. But even if it were addressed, and a more conventional system patched in, it would be impossible to recommend this game to anyone. Framed as a spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld, Underworld Ascendant misses the mark with almost every shot, much like my aforementioned hapless archer. At the same time, even freed from the expectations its historical baggage brings, it is a clear failure. The spirit of Ultima Underworld lives on elsewhere."
2716,Wargame: European Escalation,8.0,2,"Supreme Commander or Sins of a Solar Empire. Eugen Systems has managed to craft both a great wargame and an entertaining RTS in one exhilarating package.        Wargame: European Escalation is well named because it feels more like a Panzer General-style ""beer and pretzels"" wargame than a real-time strategy game. There is no base building or unit micromanagement, but you have more traditional wargame concerns to focus on instead. For example, units have a finite amount of ammunition and fuel and must be resupplied in the field. Supply trucks can repair, rearm, and refuel units, but they also have a finite number of supplies. To keep an offense rolling, your best bet is to use the FOBs to restock the supply trucks and send them scurrying back to the front. Another example of Wargame's rich heritage is the role that terrain plays in the game. For instance, most units have trouble seeing over the next hill or spotting threats hidden in a nearby dense forest.      Therefore, sensible use of reconnaissance units is important. Furthermore, vehicles can get temporarily bogged down in harsh terrain like swamps. Roads are important because they allow for quicker movement and better fuel efficiency, but they can be death traps for your armored column if they run past dense woods packed with enemy antitank infantry. Blitzing through open countryside may seem like a convenient way to avoid certain obstacles, but helicopters more than 2,000 meters away may see your forces and open up on them with rocket pods and antitank guided missiles.        The wargame heritage doesn't stop there. Each of the game's hundreds of units has unique stats. For example, the AMX-30B2 tank has three types of weapon systems, each of which has different stats like caliber, range, ammo, rate of fire, accuracy, and armor-piercing-versus-high-explosive attack values. Besides the weapons, units have stats like speed, fuel capacity, optics, and armor (and front, side, rear, and top armor have separate values). Furthermore, units have morale, and if their morale drops too low, they become too panicked to respond to your orders. Retreating units need precious minutes to regain their composure, which can be disastrous for the unit in question, as well as your plans.     By contrast, the RTS side of Wargame's heritage is fairly minimal. There are no bases to build, no special powers or superweapons to use, and resourcing is limited to securing zones on the map with a command vehicle. New units may be requisitioned with the points that trickle in from the zones you occupy, provided that you control a deployment zone (the areas on the edges of the map marked with large white arrows).     Also, there is very little in the way of unit micromanagement. Your control options are as follows: you can toggle certain weapon systems on or off, regroup four straggling tanks into a platoon, order units to fire at an area they cannot see (particularly useful for having artillery demoralize anyone in the general vicinity of where their ordinance hits), command units to use roads whenever possible, tell helicopters to change their altitudes, or move infantry units into and out of transport vehicles.        At first glance, Wargame is a daunting prospect. There are a lot of variables to consider, and it does play out in real time, after all. However, a smart interface makes it very approachable. First off, Wargame allows you a better view of the battlefield than most RTS games, which tend to prevent you from zooming too far above your units.      In Wargame, you can zoom out to a bird's-eye view reminiscent of Supreme Commander, at which point all the units turn into their respective standard NATO military symbols. Icons appear over units when they are running low on fuel or ammo or when they are in danger of being routed. If you pull the camera in closer, red text above the unit informs you of various problems and how long these effects will persist. For example, a shot-up helicopter may have the message ""fuel leak 20 seconds"" above it, or a tank may be cursed by ""damaged tracks 5 seconds.""       It's a useful way to tell why your units are not behaving as you want them to and how long you need to wait before everything is back in proper order. Selecting a unit quickly tells you its current morale, ammo, fuel, and damage. Little circles above the units slowly form, detailing when a unit will finish reloading its main gun and be able to fire it again. Furthermore, you can toggle an in-game information panel that lets you see a specific unit type's stats. The interface makes Wargame more approachable for everyone while giving those interested easy access to more detailed statistics.        Wargame contains four separate single-player campaigns. Each campaign, except for the fourth one, is self-contained and based on a historical event that could have spiraled out of control. The first campaign begins when East German soldier Werner Weinhold kills two of his comrades while escaping to West Germany. The second starts when General Jaruzelski takes control of the Polish Communist Party and declares martial law (in part to forestall Warsaw Pact military intervention in Poland). The third centers on NATO's Able Archer military exercise.      However, in each of these scenarios, history takes a violent turn: the East Germans invade West Germany after it refuses to extradite Weinhold, the bulk of the Polish military refuses to stand behind Jaruzelski and spearheads a national uprising against Communist rule, and the Warsaw Pact mistakes Able Archer as a prelude to a NATO attack and launches a preemptive offensive against Western Europe. The campaigns are all set during a specific time frame, limiting your unit selection to vehicles that were available during that period (including the West German-US jointly designed MBT-70 tank, which for budgetary reasons never got past the prototype stage).     The campaigns sport 22 missions in total and could easily take 20 to 30 hours to complete, especially if you replay missions to achieve secondary objectives. Accomplishing mission objectives gives you command stars that you can use to purchase new units for both single- and multiplayer games. Often you face a tough choice between purchasing a new unit that is usable in your current campaign and saving those points to purchase units for the later campaigns or multiplayer. Whichever route you go, you want to keep the units you do have alive, because they gain experience over the course of a campaign. Generally speaking, it's much better to have a handful of veteran T-80s than a couple dozen green T-62s.        The missions are fairly varied with only a few ""wipe out every enemy unit"" or ""hold point X for a certain amount of time"" missions (though to be fair, some of those are quite good). For example, in one Soviet mission you have to break through Polish lines to save encircled Polish forces still loyal to the Warsaw Pact. In another Soviet mission, you have to hold off NATO troops while evacuating as many units as you can to escape an attempt to encircle your army. One of the most memorable missions is an American one that starts you behind enemy lines, low on fuel and ammo. You must capture enemy supply trucks and FOBs while trying to escape the combat zone (and, if you are lucky, meet up with other NATO units left behind and destroy pesky Soviet artillery during your jaunt home for some extra command stars).     One minor problem with all of the campaigns is that while most of them open with video footage of the events that started the campaign, none of them have an ending video. Of course it would be hard to find footage of events that never happened, but surely it would be easy to find footage of Soviet and American leaders meeting to represent a peace treaty being negotiated, or footage of a parade in Red Square to showcase a celebration of a Warsaw Pact victory. Still, this is a minor quibble, and the absence of ending cutscenes doesn't detract from the quality of the campaigns.       After you've played the first single-player campaign, which doubles as Wargame's tutorial, there are multiplayer and skirmish options available. In these modes you can field decks of unit cards earned with command stars gained through the single- and multiplayer modes. Each deck is limited to 25 units, but when adding a unit to a deck you also receive all of its variants that you've unlocked. So while a Leopard 1A1 would take up only one spot in your deck, the 1A2, 1A3, 1A4, and 1A5 would also be available. You are limited to five units per category (logistic, reconnaissance, tank, infantry, support, vehicle, and helicopter), so you have to pick wisely.        Multiplayer and skirmish modes are essentially identical, with the main difference being whether or not a computer player is involved. In both modes there are 11 maps, three team options (NATO vs. Warsaw Pact or intra-alliance conflicts), two victory conditions (time limit or destruction), and a choice of how many points' worth of units each player may start with. The skirmish AI is fairly crafty, much like the AI in Eugen's earlier Act of War series. Even the easy AI makes a valiant effort to find and destroy your precious command vehicles.     It's really a shame there are no options for a multiplayer ""comp stomp"" at this time. One difference between multiplayer and skirmish games is that multiplayer games, whether ranked or unranked, net you experience points. Once you get enough experience, you level up and gain extra command stars to spend on your decks.     The 11 maps suffer from a lack of diversity. There are no maps with large urban areas, for example. Instead, most maps are large rural areas with some hills, forests, and flatlands to traverse. The best of these is Hell's Highway, which includes a major highway running through the center of the map. Generally, the maps with rivers are more interesting because they break up the monotony somewhat. One example is the Three Mile Island map that is split by a gigantic river and includes three islands as well as a large center area to fight over. One of the islands even has a lovely nuclear plant on it, at least until you make it explode.        The best way to win in multiplayer or skirmish is to take out the enemy's command vehicles, since these are essential for locking down sectors and gaining resources. If you deny the enemy access to deployment zones, then they won't be getting any reinforcements, and if you destroy all of an enemy's command vehicles, it's an automatic victory. So be certain to keep yours hidden and well guarded. Even the easy AI loves to send helicopters out to hunt for your precious command vehicles.      Wargame’s visual and audio design is exceptional. When you are zoomed in, the vehicle models look very detailed. The only details missing are minor things like fields rustling beneath a hovering helicopter. Overall, the vehicles look accurate and blow up nicely. Unfortunately, you are probably going to be playing from a zoomed-out perspective and will miss out on much of the detail. The sound effects are great, but the music is entirely forgettable. The unit chatter is somewhat disappointing despite being in the national language of the selected force.    Ride of the Valkyries as they blow up a ton of units.        The other issues with the sound are minor: occasionally the voice-overs detailing mission objectives are slightly different from the onscreen text (though the gist of what they are saying is always the same), and the voice acting of the main character in the fourth campaign is laughably emotionless given that campaign's plot.     Wargame: European Escalation, despite its few flaws, is something special. It's an accessible wargame/RTS hybrid with the capability to engross both fans of the good old-fashioned tank rush and hardcore grognards (who have been debating which side would win in a non-nuclear Third World War for decades). The genres merge well, the graphics and interface are great, and the single-player campaigns alone offer an immense value. Most importantly, it answers some of life's most important questions, like how many T-34/85s a platoon of Challenger 1s can take down before they are finally overwhelmed.    "
1197,Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue,7.0,2,"If it's original content you seek, then you're in luck--it's the best part of the package. Birth by Sleep: A Fragmentary Passage picks up where the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II: Birth by Sleep left off; Aqua and her Keyblade facing Cinderella's castle in a realm of darkness where the shadows are preying on the lore's more brightly colored locales like Aladdin's Agrabah.Newcomers should beware, though. Aside from a text-based recap, it does little to prepare you for talk of characters like Ventus and Terra who haven't been in any of the recent games. It also takes a mere three hours to finish. Length aside, it's a rich and beautiful experience filled with effects that show off Unreal Engine 4's ability to render realistic details on surfaces like water and cobblestones without sacrificing the overall cartoony aesthetic. It's the best Kingdom Hearts has ever looked, frankly, and that's a good thing, since the engine (and the final cutscene) suggests A Fragmentary Passage could be considered a visual demo of sorts for the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III.Even if it feels a little like playing the Kingdom Hearts games of a decade ago without all the additions in between, it's fun to play and often feels more fluid and focused. Light puzzles dot Aqua's journey, including some that have her chasing down gears to repair a bridge or using mirrors to tinker with gravity. The smooth combat sees her whacking aside fiends with her keyblade while double-jumping, building chained attacks, and casting spells. There's little in the way of true character progression, although various challenges allow you to earn cosmetic items like dress patterns and Minnie Mouse ears.If you’re put off by A Fragmentary Passage's three hour running time, you'll be happy to know you'll get a couple dozen hours out of the HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance. Considering that it's a straight remaster from the 3DS with nothing in the way of new elements, it doesn't look half bad. However, it's too bad nothing was done to populate Dream Drop Distance's overly roomy, empty worlds, a flaw that seems all the more obvious on a bigger screen. The upgraded graphics don't come anywhere near the detail in A Fragmentary Passage, but they are a big improvement over the source material. The Flowmotion combat system that sends you zooming past enemies, bouncing off walls, and swinging from light fixtures translates well, as does handling the Pokemon-like Dream Eaters that are now accessible with a quick flick of the analog stick. In almost every instance, the transition from handheld to gamepad has been smartly handled.If you’re put off by A Fragmentary Passage's three hour running time, you'll be happy to know you'll get a couple dozen hours out of the HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance.Unfortunately the same can't be said of the Drop system. Two characters, Sora and Riku, have independent tales that take place concurrently, but a constantly depleting stamina bar dictates how long you can play as a particular character. Once it drains completely, the game switches to the other character regardless of what you're doing. It worked well enough on the 3DS since its mobile nature meant gameplay sessions would likely be comparatively short, but it's just tiresome when you're playing for long periods on the PS4.And that leaves us with Kingdom Hearts x Back Cover, the weakest link in Final Chapter Prologue. It's not actually a game; instead, it's better described as a roughly 80-minute cutscene that dramatizes events from the mobile and browser game Kingdom Hearts X, apparently so players don't have to bother playing through the actual game. As with A Fragmentary Passage, it looks fantastic, as it's all rendered with Unreal Engine 4.However, it lacks some of Kingdom Hearts' charmingly goofy conceits, since it focuses on series-specific characters and omits cameos from the likes of Mickey Mouse or Jack Sparrow. The stars here are five animal-masked ""Foretellers"" whose heyday was ages before the Keyblade War and the events of Birth by Sleep. This might have been interesting had the runtime been extended to further examine the connection between the Foretellers. As it is, however, Back Cover amounts to little more than characters yammering about dull politics and fails to provide meaningful context for the lore. And worst of all, it ends on a cliffhanger that does little to justify the wait it took to reach it. It's largely forgettable."
523,Minecraft Dungeons,7.0,2,"Minecraft represented a massive paradigm shift in games, having served as a popular proto-example of both early access releases and unstructured, creation-based gameplay. More than a decade later, Minecraft Dungeons doesn't strive toward revolutionary, but it may just use the now-familiar trappings of its namesake to introduce a new generation of players to old-school tropes. The dungeon-crawler is a light, breezy introduction to the genre for newcomers and a friendly, low-impact callback for veterans.Those experienced with games like Diablo or Torchlight already know the basic gist. You venture from a hub area into various environments, battle enemy hordes, occasionally fell some larger-than-life boss monster, and then spend time laying out and sorting through your new loot like a kid who just opened a pack of baseball cards. Rinse, repeat.Within that framework there is some simplification in Minecraft Dungeons, which helps to make it more inviting. You only have six gear slots--melee, bow, armor, and three artifact-based abilities. You won't find specialized classes or complex skill trees here. Everything is tied to your gear, and the level-ups mostly matter in that they determine the quality of your loot drops.That loot rains down constantly, sometimes a sprinkle but more often a monsoon, which means you'll be constantly swapping your weapons and armor sets. Minecraft Dungeons is far from precious with its gear, so it's not uncommon to find yourself switching three or four times in a single stage. At first, these upgrades appear pretty linear--replacing a sword with a new, stronger sword. But before long, the Enchantment system comes into play, which provides Dungeons with its strategic depth.Enchantments are specialized upgrades to each of your primary pieces of gear. Each level up gives you an enchantment point to select one from a handful of passive buffs, but you earn back your spent points whenever you salvage a piece of equipment that's already been enchanted. In the early game when a weapon might only have one enchantment slot and fairly vanilla buffs, these are nice bonuses but don't significantly impact how you approach the game. As you progress, these become instrumental in adding depth and a difficulty ramp. Finding more complex enchantment combinations can make the difference between a brittle build or a powerhouse. That also makes the search for new loot both thrilling and progressively more thoughtful. Since you earn your enchantment points back for salvaging, swapping out a new piece of gear means you can enchant it with several upgrades from the start. The late-game is a series of constant trade-offs, finding your rhythm with a new set of abilities and buffs before exchanging them for something completely different.At one point I had one enchantment that would pull enemies toward me on a regular pulse, and another that did fire damage to all enemies within my immediate vicinity. That led me to approach combat much more aggressively than I had before, often throwing myself into the middle of a pack of enemies. But once I swapped that gear for a stronger one that lacked those abilities, I went back to a more conservative strategy of picking off enemies with arrows before approaching.While enchantments make the combat strategically complex, the moment-to-moment gameplay is relatively simple. Most melee attacks don't stagger opponents, so there's no weight or impact to hits. You'll often just hit enemies as they hit you, planted to the floor like a couple of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, until one of you falls down. The melee weapons are well-differentiated by their attack speed and range, but that's basically all there is to it. Melee battles can also feel a little unfair when you're surrounded by mobs and unable to move, especially if you find yourself dropped there by surprise from a jump pad.Sometimes the simplicity of the combat can get in its own way. You can pick up TNT boxes as random drops and carry them around with you for when you need a quick area-of-effect attack, but the throw command is set to the same button as the ranged attack. That makes it impossible to fire an arrow without getting rid of the TNT boxes you may have been saving, and the two don't really serve the same function. This just means you have to sacrifice your AOE availability anytime you need the precision of an arrow--or any time you forget in the heat of the moment, which happened to me more times than I can count.Minecraft Dungeons is a short game on its Default difficulty setting, but it's clear from the start that it's not meant to be the entire experience. Completing on Default opens up Adventure Mode, with higher-level enemies and better loot, and completing Adventure opens Apocalypse. The game is built around relatively short, self-contained, repeatable stages, each with difficulty sliders. Adventure Mode starts to roll out gear with more powerful abilities--denoted by a small icon that simply says ""Powerful."" That both provides more incentive to keep hunting better loot on the higher difficulty, and gives you something to do with the excess enchantment points since Powerful abilities are slightly more expensive.This emphasis on finding loot comes at the expense of the in-game economy, though, because despite finding gems frequently throughout dungeons, there just isn't much use for them. You can spend them to roll a random piece of gear at your camp, but it hardly ever stacks up to the gear you've already found, and turning unwanted gear into salvage only gets you a fraction of the full value. As a result, it's not really worth it, and there's nothing else to spend your hard-earned gems on.Like the characters, the stages themselves are Minecraft-accurate, carrying over an aesthetic made of parts that are clearly recognizable to anyone who has spent time in the block-building game. In fact, the look is carried so faithfully that a dedicated builder could probably recreate Dungeons environments in Minecraft proper. Those environments are procedurally generated and themed after various Minecraft biomes like swamps or underground caverns. Repeating a stage often enough will expose some common elements and pieces that consistently appear in every run, but usually the pieces blend seamlessly together and look as if they could have been constructed whole-cloth.The Minecraft spirit is also carried through the mobs themselves. Classic enemies like Creepers or Skeletons are among the first you'll see, and sometimes the stage will darken for a randomized visit from the Enderman as a miniboss encounter. Dungeons also finds ways to create its own bits of Minecraft identity, like with the addition of the ""Key Golem""--an adorable living key that obviously does not want to be put in a door and will run away from you at the first opportunity it gets.While enchantments make the combat strategically complex, the moment-to-moment gameplay is relatively simple.The co-op works without a hitch, offering an easy way to join up with friends or guide less experienced players through tough challenges. Gear can be concentrated in different directions, with emphasis on elements like healing or damage mitigation, which could theoretically allow a very well-coordinated team replicate the standard tank-healer-DPS model. Realistically, though, a team will consist of several single-player builds, and having partners simply works to help mitigate some of the crowd control issues that exist when going solo. A few smart inclusions, like color-coded loot and a quick teleport tool, make it easy to stay together and let everyone enjoy their winnings. Unfortunately, offline games operate as if you're playing online, including the inability to pause.Minecraft Dungeons is missing conspicuous parts of what gave the namesake its identity--most noticeably, breaking through walls to explore underground caverns and using the found materials to craft. But because it's such a successful departure from its predecessor, Dungeons shows how flexible the franchise has become. Rather than shift our expectations of what games can be, it's banking on its own popularity to introduce younger players to a classic genre and serves as a short-but-sweet treat for looter vets. It scratches the dungeon-crawler itch with a sense of goofy charm and expands what Minecraft can be. Minecreaft Dungeons is featured on our list of the Best Xbox Games for Kids.  "
1725,Ultra Street Fighter IV,8.0,2,"In his review, former GameSpot editor Dan Chiappini described Street Fighter IV as ""undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the fighting genre in this generation."" It's a worthy accolade, and one that still holds true today. Ultra Street Fighter IV brings with it a whole host of changes and additions to the game's previous releases: Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition and its 2012 update. Six new stages, five new characters, and three new game mechanics are successfully integrated into an already feature-rich game and introduce new strategies that help keep this seasoned fighter feeling fresh. Street Fighter X Tekken. However, these characters aren't just cut-and-paste copies from SFXT; instead, they have been reworked to fit naturally within SFIV's play style. Newcomer Decapre rounds out the roster. While she bears a striking resemblance to another world warrior, Decapre has her own distinct fighting style, which deftly mixes charge-based attacks with rushdown tactics, two fighting styles that traditionally do not mix. Outside of the five new challengers, Ultra Street Fighter IV brings with it a myriad of tweaks and changes for the existing cast. None of the existing 39 characters have gone untouched in this expansion; however, the bulk of those changes will likely go unnoticed to the untrained eye. Increasing the damage of Rose's crouching light punch by 10 or reducing the startup of Dudley's medium kick by one frame may not sound like much on paper, but taken as a whole, these changes and dozens more combine to create a more equally balanced roster. While the character-specific tweaks are not as apparent, ultra combo double, red focus attacks, and delayed wake-up are much more disruptive additions to the core mechanics of Street Fighter IV. The ultra combo double is a third ultra combo option that lets you go into battle armed with both of your character's ultra combos, but at reduced damage for both. This gives you more options in the fight, and is an especially effective addition for characters such as Zangief who have both antiair and close-range ultras. A red focus attack functions in much the same way as the standard focus attack, except that it can absorb multiple hits at the cost of one energy block. This makes it a great tool for absorbing multi-hit attacks--looking at you, E. Honda--or for punishing a random ultra combo. Rounding out the trio is the delayed wake-up. Being able to delay when your character rises is a much more subtle addition, but an important one nonetheless. The delay does not last long, but it is enough to throw off the timing of a practiced opponent's next attack. Together, these three changes have a tremendous impact on the higher-level strategies of Street Fighter IV and offer new strategies for series veterans. Ultra Street Fighter IV's updates don't stop at its characters. Online, you can compete in the new Elimination mode or work alongside distant friends in the Online Training mode. Elimination is a competitive mode where two teams of three duke it out to see which team is the best. When a player is defeated, the next one on his or her team swaps in until one side has no combatants left. To help prevent one player from steamrolling an entire team, Elimination mode does not restore health between rounds (naturally) or matches, similar in structure to the King of Fighters series. A couple of new options for the truly dedicated round out Training mode. Save states let you take a snapshot of the current battle and return to it at any time with the push of a button. This is a handy addition for those who want to practice location-specific attacks or combos rapid-fire without having to reset the character blocking over and over again. Network simulation is the other upgrade, but it's really more of a novelty. This option lets you simulate increasingly severe levels of input lag to make you feel as if you're playing against someone with a poor Internet connection. While so much of Street Fighter IV has been touched up in this new expansion, Trials mode continues to receive the cold shoulder. This mode is now horribly out of date and still uses character data from Super Street Fighter IV. It lacks trials for all five of Ultra's newcomers, as well as the previous batch of newcomers: Evil Ryu, Oni, Yun, and Yang. Since this mode is a good way to get acquainted with new characters, it's disappointing to see that developer Capcom has not yet updated it. Capcom has said it plans to release some sort of update later on down the line, but the absence of a fully realized Trials mode is certainly felt. Trials aside, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a great expansion that smartly builds upon the core game. With all of its tweaks, new mechanics, and extra game modes, Ultra will definitely appeal to the diehard Street Fighter IV fans who still remember the tyranny of vanilla Sagat. Nearly every aspect of the game has received some sort of enhancement or upgrade, and the result is an expansion that makes a great game even better."
239,Destiny 2,9.0,2,"For as long as there have been Destiny and Destiny 2 expansions, those expansions have followed a specific formula. The add-ons have always been standalone offerings with new guns and a new playable destination, dropping players into a new story more or less independent of what came before. Each included a pile of new content and a fresh story campaign, but they were less like subsequent chapters for a living game than semi-discreet new modules bolted onto an existing, sprawling whole. The Witch Queen changes all that; rather than connecting something new and separate onto Destiny 2 with no context, it instead is an organic, evolutionary outgrowth. This is Bungie's live game molting, emerging from a cocoon as something better, smarter, and more complete than it was before.Back when it was first discussing The Witch Queen, Bungie called the expansion's new story ""the definitive Destiny campaign."" Despite being marketing speak, that statement has turned out to be true--Destiny expansions are largely built on multi-mission story offerings, but The Witch Queen's campaign stands alone among its predecessors. It is, without hyperbole, the best campaign Bungie has released for the game, eclipsing even the most-loved releases of the past, like Forsaken or The Taken King. This is what people like about Destiny, boiled down into approachable missions you can play alone or with friends.Destiny campaigns lean toward the simple end of the spectrum, giving players an on-ramp into the more complex offerings that really define the game: its six-player raids and three-player dungeons. The problem with this approach has always been that, while the early parts of any given Destiny 2 expansion feel good--the game is nothing if not extremely satisfying in terms of straightforward shooting mechanics--they aren't really indicative of what makes the game good. Destiny 2 has really been defined by its raids, which are full of brilliant mechanics that require adept teams to learn the rules, establish roles, communicate intentions, and work together like the intricate components of a clockwork device. You don't really get a sense of what's great about Destiny 2 until you play its best content, which is always the high-level stuff that can be tough to get to.The Witch Queen upends that, clearly taking cues from raids, dungeons, and other high-level content to bring those same feelings and experiences to its story. Fights aren't just big arenas with bullet-sponges that need to be chipped away at; they're fast-moving situations full of combatants that often have you working your brain to solve a puzzle or develop a strategy while you're also identifying targets and prioritizing threats. One standout moment has you fighting a boss who's immune to your attacks and chases you through a darkened maze. Your job is to find and destroy the hidden crystals powering the boss's shield, but they're nestled off in dark corners somewhere, guarded by smaller foes. It's almost impossible to see your path, but you can shoot glowing orange pustules sticking out of walls to spray their incandescent goo all over the ground, lighting your way. So you're running from a huge monster, blasting his minions, hunting the objects that can allow you to hurt him, and trying to light your way through a maze. Levels drip-feed you new mechanics and ideas all along the way so that it all comes together in the boss fight, and coupled with Destiny 2's already excellent combat foundation, it makes for an intensely fast-paced, hectic experience.The campaign is filled with these standout moments, with excellent level and arena design throughout, and each mission feeling significantly different from the others. Along with great levels, though, Bungie has also brought a slate of helpful quality-of-life improvements, like extra checkpoints and the new ""major encounters'' approach. Much like the inclusion of the brainier raid-like mechanics, this is another page borrowed from endgame content--major encounters are big fights with a clear start and endpoint, where you can refill all your ammo beforehand so you're prepped for what's coming, and where you get a big pile of equipment rewards at the end. Each of these arenas feels like a significant event, one that will challenge your abilities and give you a big feeling of accomplishment once you've bested it.That's especially true when playing the story campaign on the new Legendary difficulty, which is a phenomenal addition to the overall package. Because they're geared toward being on-ramps for new players, Destiny story campaigns tend to be easier experiences than most of the rest of the game. Bungie acknowledged, however, that veteran players have the weapons and experience for a significantly tougher fight, and the Legendary campaign obliges beautifully. It caps player Power levels beneath the recommended maximums while adding a few key modifiers and other tweaks, raising the stakes by making everything just that much more lethal. The tactical consideration of protecting yourself and taking down important targets before they can seriously threaten you--coupled with the smart mechanics and encounter design--make for an excellent challenge that is consistently, exquisitely harrowing.That high-intensity threat feeling is amplified further by the inclusion of a major new enemy in the Hive Lightbearers, mini-boss-like foes who show up at key moments and in major encounters. These new foes wield the same space magic superpowers as players, invoking a sort of middle ground between playing against computer-controlled enemies and playing against other humans in the competitive portion of Destiny 2. What's more is the Lightbearers are legitimately deadly; whenever they show up, they completely rewrite the situation of which they're a part. They demand you assess the new threat and alter your strategy accordingly, lest you be annihilated by a burst of lightning or cut in half by a flying Captain America-like energy shield. The Lightbearers add an extra dimension to The Witch Queen's story encounters that further shifts the usual Destiny 2 paradigm, forcing you to use what you know of your own capabilities to counter those of your enemies.The story, too, is among the better ones Destiny 2 has told, largely because it's not a standalone addition to the game that came out of nowhere, but the culmination of years of storytelling, and particularly the last four seasonal stories that appeared in the game in 2021. Since before the release of the Beyond Light expansion, the trajectory of the Destiny 2 world has been altered by the gravity of Savathun--an eons-old godlike alien whose modus operandi is manipulation through lies and deceit. After literal years of Destiny 2 players seeing Savathun's machinations play out in small-scale altercations, The Witch Queen brings her plans to fruition.It's a pretty good story, all things considered--one that is conscious of players investing in the game, not just for the last year, but at least since the release of Destiny 2 in 2017. It makes use of key elements of Destiny 2's deep lore, bringing some of the strangest and most interesting aspects of the universe to the forefront, and recontextualizing things we thought were settled about the story. After more than a year of build-up to this exact moment, The Witch Queen is both a satisfying unification of the threads Destiny 2 has been weaving for a long time, and great at dropping intriguing clues that keep you invested. Like Beyond Light, though, it excels most when it's focused on its characters and the conflicts between their ideologies and the threats they're facing.The Witch Queen upends what we have long accepted about key elements of the game, in particular our relationship with the immortality-granting ""good"" force known as the Light. When the Hive, an alien death cult known only for conquest and genocide and arguably humanity's greatest enemy, also claim the power of the Light, it shakes everyone to their core (although the player character, who at least has a few lines this time out, remains unfortunately stoic most of the time). The best moments of the campaign are when the player's Ghost, their stalwart companion and the character manifestation of their connection with the Light, explodes with rage at seeing that power in the hands of the Hive. Watching other characters who've treated the Light with religious reverence questioning those beliefs and choices helps make the stakes feel more important than just shooting another big alien before it can do some kind of magic ritual to ruin everyone's lives. The Witch Queen feels like it matters beyond what you're shooting; it's affecting the people who make up the foundation of the game.The struggle of Destiny 2's story and its expansions is that so much of the required context to make sense of it exists in lore passages dropped as flavor text on the weapons you find or in special lore books you unlock--it has long been a problem with the game that its best stories tend not to happen in the game you're actually playing. Bungie has gotten a lot better about this in the last few years, and The Witch Queen is probably the best job it's ever done of mixing its great lore ideas with the actual player experience. But it still struggles with the fact that it's trying to convey complex in-universe concepts to all players--from those who've read all the lore to the brand-new folks just jumping into the game for the first time.Although it certainly tries, The Witch Queen can't quite thread that needle; it compromises the complex stuff in an attempt to make things clearer for players who haven't been in the game long enough to establish context, and in so doing, it undercuts the impact of some elements for those who've been around the whole time. What's more, even the simplified story isn't simple enough to carry new players through--so the compromises end up weakening the story for both audiences. While this chapter makes clearer sense than some past ones have, it's still best enjoyed by people who have a firm grasp of Destiny's long-term story and lore, and even then, it has its confusing spots.Still, there's a lot of great story being told here. Following the campaign, there's a whole host of things to do in the new destination the game adds, Savathun's throne world, which is full of secrets to uncover, additional missions to play, and weapons to earn. The Witch Queen also adds a new weapon-crafting system that provides a whole new element to the usual loot chase that defines Destiny 2. The system generally feels a bit too grindy in its earliest iteration--a lot of unlocking weapons and their various upgrades still requires a huge reliance on random drops--but Bungie has already announced plans to make adjustments to alleviate that issue. Still, the system adds a lot of cool new things to chase and customize, bringing a fresh angle on the ever-present loot chase that defines the game. After a few days with it, I've developed a version of the new first-person melee weapon, the Glaive, that I love, and I have plenty of plans for new auto rifles and scout rifles. Using the grind to make exactly what you want out of your arsenal is an addition to Destiny 2's loot system that feels like it's paying off my investments and incentivizing customization, and it's a great new facet of the game's underlying formula.There are a few more changes to Destiny 2 with The Witch Queen that elevate the game, like adjustments to the Void player subclasses that offer a whole lot more freedom to make loadouts, and tweaks to the Gambit activity that make it more competitive. Those adjustments, too, feel like Destiny 2 continuing to evolve as Bungie hones it to its best possible version.Along with additional story offerings and gear, The Witch Queen adds a new raid to Destiny 2 as part of its offering, called Vow of the Disciple. Destiny raids have long been impressive affairs in game design and art direction, offering some incredible multiplayer shooter gameplay. Vow continues that tradition as another excellent offering, a fitting next-level cap to a brilliant expansion that continues to add a lot more to Destiny 2's gameworld. Its mechanics borrow a bit from past raids in ways that play into its overall themes, giving it a more familiar feel than some Bungie's other offerings in this department. Our Day One raid attempt also suffered a bit, thanks to a few bugs during boss fights that could slam a solid run to a halt. But mostly minor frustrations haven't marred another extremely fun, high-intensity multiplayer offering in Vow of the Disciple.Delving into all its new features, new missions, new locations, and new raid, The Witch Queen has been extremely impressive and a ton of fun. The centerpiece is the laudable story campaign, making a lot of the game's best design more approachable for a variety of characters, but The Witch Queen also invokes the best parts of Destiny's past, as well--like the secret-laden, dense, and fascinating locations found in The Taken King and Forsaken expansions. The Witch Queen is a massive step forward for the game, the culmination of a recent history of great refinements and additions, resulting in a Destiny 2 that's in its best form yet."
2841,The Binding of Isaac,8.0,2,"  They say that God has a plan for all of us. In Isaac's case, the plan begins and ends with the business end of a butcher's knife. To escape his grisly fate--at the hands of his own mother no less--our young hero must brave a labyrinth of unspeakable horrors while tapping into the dark arts of witchcraft and household objects. Spawned from the mind of Team Meat (Super Meat Boy) cofounder Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is a twisted tale. It masterfully brings together the randomization and difficulty of a roguelike, such as Dungeons of Dredmor, with the top-down perspective of The Legend of Zelda to create an enthralling experience that will keep you hooked. And even after you finish the game, there's plenty more content left to discover to keep you engaged long after the credits roll.        Isaac's descent begins in a basement. This floor and all subsequent floors are divided into single, connecting rooms that contain monsters or items. A boss chamber lies at the end of the maze and houses a gruesome fiend that Isaac must overcome before descending to the next floor. Isaac's initial attack is weaponized crying--meaning he can strike foes from afar by blinking out crocodile-sized tears in four directions. Keys, bombs, and other items become available as you progress, but no matter how strong you become, death remains a constant companion during this challenging journey. Bite the dust and you'll have to start the whole game over again.     The randomized structure of each floor means no two play sessions are exactly alike. Although the path may be different, there are still a few familiar stops along the way. Most common are the enemies. If you're lucky, flies and lava will be the most of your troubles, but most likely, your move-and-shoot abilities will be tested by flaming, headless torsos or blood-vomiting gluttons. As you progress these enemies will evolve and learn new tricks to maintain the challenge. If you have a few keys handy, then you can access the item shops and special item rooms located on each floor. In lieu of gaining levels, Isaac's power increases by collecting items, which can increase his stats or confer special abilities.     The dozens of objects you encounter aren't your typical ""+1 Sword of Hitting"" or ""Giant Golden Pauldrons."" Instead, most items apply supernatural properties to everyday objects. Donning your mother's underwear increases your range, while drinking chocolate milk lets you charge up your chocolate projectiles. Items also change your character's appearance, though it's usually for the worse. The growth hormones you just picked up might make Isaac stronger, but they also turn his face into a lumpy mess. Chances are that by the end of the game, you won't even recognize Isaac. Discovering new items and experimenting with different item combinations are the most appealing aspects of the game.        You have plenty of opportunities to visit and revisit the dungeons in The Binding of Isaac because the game is incredibly difficult. Your character's limited health and the scarcity of supplies lend tension to every encounter. However, the frustrations of death are lessened by the game's tight controls and smart design. Rarely do you walk into a room and immediately get ambushed. Instead, you are granted a few beats to assess the enemy makeup and plan how to approach the situation. Patience in this game, more so than any item, can be your strongest ally or toughest foe; It's easy to get frustrated and try to blitz through a complicated room. But when you get on a roll, it's thrilling to skirt past enemy projectiles as you fight to keep Isaac's precious health points intact.     Once you finish the game for the first time, there is plenty more content to unlock, including floors, characters, and items. The difficulty continues to rise as well. The new floors naturally increase the challenge by making the game longer, while the new characters generally have less health than Isaac but more interesting special abilities. The game's music is also smartly designed to compensate for its repetition. It instills a sense of foreboding with music that becomes more unsettling as you venture deeper into the madness. And since you'll be hearing the early tracks a lot, they do a good job of resting in the background without becoming tiresome.     While The Binding of Isaac has a great sense of discovery, rediscovery is an issue. The game has an item collection screen that displays which items you've encountered. However, the only thing it tells you about the item is its name. Having an item's description on this screen would be an excellent tool. Using a controller could also be a great way to play as Isaac, given the game's pseudo-twin-stick shooter design, but the game does not officially support this setup. Instead, it advertises you to download a third-party piece of software; this has uneven results, however, making you wish controller support was supported innately.        Through smart design and simple mechanics, The Binding of Isaac manages to feel approachable despite its difficulty. Superfluous elements have been stripped out, and what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions. While it does lack some of the extra bells and whistles of other modern games, The Binding of Isaac remains an enjoyable (and demented) adventure.  "
3748,Alien Syndrome (2007),5.0,1,"  On paper, Sega and Totally Games' new Alien Syndrome remake for the Wii and PSP has everything it ought to. The top-down perspective, the hordes of mutated alien abominations, and the trigger-happy gameplay all seem to honor the memory of Sega's 1987 arcade classic. What's more, some light RPG elements have been added, including distinct character classes and a fairly granular level of ability customization. Heck, there's even a crafting system for conjuring supplies and upgrades. In practice, though, it's a repetitive and boring experience that fails to evoke the spirit of the original Alien Syndrome, or the superior dungeon crawlers that it attempts to crib from.        Early on, there are some thin allusions to past conflicts and dark secrets in the main character's past that serve as a lame attempt to slap more of a narrative onto Alien Syndrome than the ""kill all the aliens"" directive that supported the original. Save for a none-too-subtle reference to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, it's all pretty bland and uninteresting, and once you've been transported onto the derelict research facility infested with the Alien Syndrome in the first level, you don't hear too much more than boilerplate mission directives. It's as if the game itself loses interest in its overarching story.     Before you start wasting wave after wave of horrible alien monsters, you'll have to choose a character class to play as, which include demolitions expert, firebug, seal, tank, and sharpshooter. This initial choice will decide your starting stats as well as the type of weapon you'll start out with, though as you earn levels, you'll get points that you can put towards the proficiencies that define the other classes. The sense of freedom in developing your character is false, though, because once you've committed to a certain weapon type, it's not really worth it to put points into building up another weapon proficiency from scratch. Why waste points on unlocking a weaker weapon when you can continue to goose the potency of the weapon you're already using? It's all kind of a moot point anyway, because regardless of which class you choose, the weapons don't feel particularly powerful or, save for the melee-based tank class, very unique.     Perhaps the biggest difference between the PSP and Wii versions of Alien Syndrome are in the controls. On the PSP, your movement and aiming are both handled with the analog stick, and when you start firing a ranged weapon, you'll lock into the direction you're facing. On the Wii, movement is handled by the analog stick on the Nunchuk, though you'll control your aiming reticle with the Wii Remote, and wherever you point is where your character will shoot. This makes it easy to shoot in one direction while moving in another. The Wii shooting controls actually feel pretty good, but the PSP control scheme wins out in melee attacks simply because it sticks with basic two-button combos. On the Wii, you're forced to use a potpourri of button presses and arcane gestures with the Wii Remote that make the melee attacks too cumbersome.      Once you get into the game, you'll quickly find that Alien Syndrome is essentially a space-age dungeon crawler, but it's not a terribly good one due to issues of both quantity and quality. Though you'll be given predictable assignments like ""get the blue keycard"" or ""rescue the colonists"" on rare occasions, more often than not, your job is to get from one end of a level to the other without falling prey to the antagonistic aliens that constantly spawn around you. The first problem lies within the aliens themselves, which tend to be sluggish beasts that, if you didn't need the experience points to toughen up for the occasional, mandatory boss fight, you could just as easily run right past. If you choose to hunker down and fight the aliens, you'll find that their biggest asset is their ability to soak up damage. It doesn't make them challenging enemies, it just means that it takes a while to wear them down, and even in larger numbers you can best most of them with some easily paced circle-strafing. On the rare chance you find yourself overwhelmed by the half-dozen or so aliens that you'll usually face, you can usually just run away, and the aliens will disappear just as easily as they first spawned.         What's most exhausting about the enemies in Alien Syndrome is the terrible lack of variety. Though there are definitely several distinct types of aliens, they all manage to look kind of blobby. The game also loves a good palette swap, and those greenish worm-things you fight at the start of the game aren't functionally different from the bluish worm-things you fight around hour seven. The environments do little to add to the excitement, though if you like pointlessly serpentine mazes of nondescript corridors, occasionally punctuated with big, empty rooms, then boy howdy are you in luck! Whether you play Alien Syndrome on the Wii or the PSP, the game has a drab, murky look, though the washed-out textures and blocky designs that are hidden by the demure size of the PSP screen can be seen in all their fuzzy, big-screen glory on the Wii. Technically and artistically, this game simply isn't pleasant to look at.     Alien Syndrome can be played with up to four people locally, and though misery loves company, additional players don't make the experience any more entertaining. The original Alien Syndrome wasn't terribly groundbreaking, but it still managed to provide some manic, challenging fun. This game is an exercise in formulaic tedium that fails to deliver on the promise of an updated Alien Syndrome, or a passable action RPG experience.    "
176,Bear and Breakfast,8.0,2,"Despite that complexity, you don't need to jump into this game with a degree in design. Bear and Breakfast eases you in, with Hank and his friends simply trying to make a quick buck by transforming a rundown shed into a vacation spot. Making a room to house a guest isn't all that hard, as even the small shed is spacious enough for both a room and your front desk. As you progress, you'll unlock additional locations--like a restaurant off the freeway and two cabins up in the mountains--which are larger and afford you even more space.With the increase in size comes an increase in considerations, though. Humans are selfish creatures, with wants and needs that you'll need to account for--failing to do so will mean negative reviews, which will tank your business. Some guests require bathrooms attached to their rooms, while others want free on-site food, a nearby campsite, a fully decked-out movie theater, or heating. These services take up additional space on your property, forcing you to put those Tetris skills to the test and find a means of getting everything to fit and still look nice.Bear and Breakfast's delightful management system is based on grids and blocks, so constructing the perfect motel is like putting together a puzzle and fitting things together, only there's no right answer. Once you've created a room, you can decorate it with anything you've got stocked up in your inventory, all of which can be rotated and fit into an empty space with a satisfying snap. Every item contributes to your bed and breakfast in some way--an increase in comfort, for example--and solving the puzzle of each open space requires you to figure out how to squeeze in everything to meet the needs of your future guests.Each type of room has a minimum size and furniture requirement, which acts as a great starting point when you're planning everything out. That won't get you far if you're looking to attract pickier and more loaded guests, however. Making rooms bigger allows you to fit larger, fancier furniture, like a queen-sized bed for the bedroom or a buffet serving station for the dining room. It's a lot of fun to stare at an empty space and try to fathom how you're going to possibly fit five bedrooms, five bathrooms, and an assortment of other services into it, and then, with a spurt of creative genius, you manage to find a way.Obviously, you could just host one guest at a time, completely remaking your properties every other day to fit the next arrival. Doing so is costly, however--money is needed to make new rooms, and so you won't make much of a profit destroying and making new rooms in order to fit the ideal of every guest that crosses your doorstep. The good money lies in making a multi-roomed bed and breakfast that can host many guests at once, and still features enough amenities to keep a variety of humans happy. And then, over time, breaking down a single room and building it back even better to attract a richer clientele and slowly doing that with every room across multiple locations.You'll earn plenty of incentives beyond simple coin when building and rebuilding properties too, especially once you have two or three up and running and can pause service at one to completely redesign it while still making money elsewhere. Each property comes with an assortment of unique challenges (tasks like, ""try to build this many rooms within the space"" or ""raise the prestige of the dining area to this specific level""), and completing them nets you some nice rewards, like larger inventory space, faster walking speed, or being able to craft items even when you're not at a crafting table.These optional challenges also help in kickstarting your creativity when you may be engaging in bad practices without even realizing it. For instance, I didn't think one of my properties could even fit more than four rooms and four bathrooms until I saw a task asking me to do it. Figuring out how to make that work benefited me in the long run, as it forced me to learn the importance of conserving space--an incredibly helpful lesson to grasp ahead of tackling the endgame and final property. Setting up that final bed and breakfast is a lot, but it felt like I had been adequately trained to overcome that gauntlet through the series of challenges I had been asked to complete up to that point.I also love that Bear and Breakfast features multiple properties, as opposed to one bed and breakfast that you're forced to focus on over the course of its runtime. The different locales are located in vastly different environments and each is differently shaped too--from a small rectangular shed in the forest to a massive two-story L-shaped cabin in the mountains--so you're not tackling the exact same problem over and over. You're always trying to make the best bed and breakfast you can, but how you go about it evolves with each new location that you unlock. You only need to worry about investing in heating in the game's two colder locations, for example, and your guests will ask for higher standards when it comes to comfort and good hygiene in the arid desert in comparison to the lush forest. Your solutions for tackling one property might not work on another, encouraging you to grow as a designer and experiment further as the game goes on and you take on a greater variety of bed and breakfasts.If you need a break from all the building and planning, spending time away from your properties is also worthwhile, as you'll find plenty to help you throughout the valley and woods that Hank calls home. While exploring, you'll find materials needed to craft furniture and ingredients that can be cooked into a wide variety of delicious dishes. Perhaps most helpful is the trash that your human guests leave behind--incentivizing you to have as many guests as possible in order to accrue a large amount of litter--as it can be spent at raccoon-owned dumpsters to buy fancy cosmetics like rugs, house plants, and bookshelves. These decorations can increase the reputation of a property, bringing in guests with deeper pockets.As you explore, you'll meet plenty of colorful critters and helpful humans, from a shy goat to a friendly park ranger. Assisting them with their tasks will oftentimes benefit you, unlocking perks like new cooking recipes or staff that can oversee certain services at your properties while you're out and about. There's not too much to these characters' stories, though I found myself helping each one all the same--the promise of new services being incentive enough to go out of my way and get my friends out of whatever pickle they'd found themselves in.It's in these interactions that you also get characterization for Hank. Frankly, there's not much to him beyond being a swell guy that likes to help people, and in his discovery that he has a knack for decorating and hosting humans, he finds his purpose. He is cute though, and I love the game's adorable translations for how his well-articulated sentences actually sound to humans. Though the animal characters all seem to be included to add some charming humor, the human characters are pretty fascinating and my favorite faces to see in the game. Barbara is especially well written, with her good-natured disposition hiding a somewhat tragic backstory that ties into the game's spookier elements.Those spookier elements are only hinted at in Bear and Breakfast. The only explicit tell that they're there are the game's opening--in which Hank dreams of a nightmarish entity hidden in the woods--and then the reveal of Barbara's past near the end of the game. The rest is scattered about in optional collectibles and hidden quests, tying Bear and Breakfast's cutesy tale to a dark past of political upheaval and a dangerous cult. These elements don't seem to lead to any sort of meaningful conclusions (at least as far as I've seen), which I found to be somewhat disappointing--those small threads are interesting and I had hoped they'd go somewhere.That's not what Bear and Breakfast is largely about, though. This is a game all about making your business pop off and maybe befriending a colorful critter or two along the way. I would have liked to discover that the spookier narrative elements amount to something more, but the enjoyable management sim that I found instead kept me pleasantly entertained for hours, offering plenty of creative challenges for me to puzzle my way through, all in the name of making the cutest set of bed and breakfasts there's ever been."
2594,The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav,8.0,2,"      Could the evil Blind Seer have returned with a mission of vengeance from beyond the grave? Let's hope so, for otherwise, this would be a dull escapade. All sorts of diverse mythology is blended into this stereotypical ""loser saves the world"" saga. Geron's best buddy and possible crush is a fairy named Nuri, for instance, and their magical powers involve such spectacular incantations as one that can break vases and the other one that can--fix vases. The fantasy themes are subdued, which suits the low-key tenor of the characterizations and the voice acting. The world needs to be saved, but sometimes it's better to do so without making much fuss about it.              Sound quality, too, is inconsistent. While the story is easy to track and the dialogue well-written and acted for the most part, there are frequent hitches that remind you that the game has been translated from another language (in this case, German). You sometimes notice odd phrasing and word choices, like calling gypsies ""carnies."" Other times, conversations are hard to follow, leading to a few ""Huh?"" moments where you need to take a few extra seconds to figure out what's going on. Few of these issues fully break the suspension of disbelief, but the translation gaffes are jarring.   "
310,Deathloop,10.0,2,"The Isle of Blackreef is a place where lawlessness and debauchery aren't just welcomed but encouraged. It's caught in a time loop, so the events of any given day have no bearing on the next. At the end of every sex, drug, and alcohol binge-fueled evening, the slate is wiped clean so it can happen all over again. Memories are lost and harm--self-inflicted or done to others--is always undone. Blackreef changed me. It made me behave in a way that's not in my nature. Whether it's Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex, Splinter Cell, or Dishonored, the role I inhabit is that of a ghost, entering a scenario to achieve an objective and leaving with clean hands and conscience. I'm the pebble thrown into water that makes no ripples.And yet, in Deathloop, I murdered hundreds of Eternalists and I felt good about doing it. I tried to be true to myself--skulking across rooftops, hiding in dark corners, and carefully moving between people, but the allure of Blackreef's daily absolution was difficult to resist. I watched the first Eternalist I killed dissolve into nothingness, and a message written into the air in some ethereal ink assured me he'd return in the next loop, completely oblivious to what happened. Killing became second nature, and with no consequence why wouldn't it?The rules of Deathloop's world created an intoxicating sense of liberation, but this leads to the game's central question of purpose: When nothing matters, how do you give your actions meaning? That is where developer Arkane Lyon's gameplay design comes into play, and killing with reckless abandon becomes killing for a reason: to break the loop. The mechanics that govern the world and facilitate your quest to upend it are constructed so masterfully that there's a tangible sense of growth both in-game and out of it. You begin your first day in Blackreef dazed, confused, and incredibly hungover, and end your final one as the unstoppable architect of its demise.But what's most impressive about Deathloop is that it's also an introspective game. It's Arkane deconstructing its own brand of open-ended action and laying bare all the pieces crucial to it. The systems are presented as digestible on an individual level, but then the game subtly pushes you to put the pieces together so you can truly appreciate how the clockwork world ticks, before bringing a swift fist crashing down on it. Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks; where throwing a grenade into a soiree for sycophants counts as the right kind of experimentation and derring-do. It delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measure.At the heart of the game is Colt Vahn, a man simultaneously adrift in time and stuck within it. He wakes up on a beach with no memory of how he got there or what's really going on. However, what distinguishes him from the other hedonistic denizens of Blackreef is that he is able to retain his memories between loops. Dying will force him into a new loop, but the knowledge he has accrued up until his death will return with him. And very soon, he discovers that a strange element called Residuum can be harnessed to give his arsenal of weaponry and supernatural abilities permanence too.Like Arkane Lyon's Dishonored games, Deathloop is a fascinating mashup of styles and vibes, both narratively and aesthetically. Underpinning the world is a kind of retro-future science that, as oxymoronic as it sounds, is incredibly effective at giving the world texture--think time travel by way of 1960s computers that fill a room and look like they have less power than an original iPhone. Complementing that is an element of the supernatural that is essentially time science harnessed by a genius mind to give a chosen few the ability to do things like teleport, link the fates of people together, become almost invisible to the naked eye, or throw objects around an environment with a wave of the hand. These abilities are bestowed to the Visionaries, an eclectic group of elites that the rank and file are sworn to protect so that their life of indulgence can remain eternal. Colt's goal is to kill these Visionaries and, in doing so, break the time loop that keeps him trapped there. The rub is that it needs to be done in one day--a single loop. Easier said than done given that the game operates on a day and night cycle where, over the course of the loop, each Visionary has their own routine and life to lead.Complicating matters further is the fact that the Visionaries know Colt is out to get them and, in fact, all of them have some sort of pre-existing relationship with him. One in particular, Julianna, takes it upon herself to be a thorn in Colt's side. She serves the role of antagonist but the situation is clearly complicated between them. Their interpersonal dynamic is placed front and center to drive much of the narrative and characterization, and both characters are realized exceptionally well.Julianna is the voice in Colt's ear and also over Blackreef's loudspeakers, and she does her damndest to get under his skin. She picks at him in a way that only someone with a deep personal connection to you can, using insight into his personality and history to constantly undermine him and poke at his neuroses. She's always one step ahead, exposing Colt's habits, analyzing his behaviors, and revealing truths about Colt that, because of his initial amnesia, he's yet to realize himself. And yet, there's also a sweetness to their interactions at times, like a couple in the heat of an argument remembering for just a moment why they care about each other. She's a confusing presence, in one breath chastising him for his actions and in another encouraging them. She guides him to objectives and then lays the guilt on thick when he achieves them.In a very real sense, she's a pure agent of chaos and her motivations remain unclear until just the right moment. The voice acting is absolutely crucial to selling this relationship and in that regard, it is achieved exceptionally well thanks to the outstanding delivery by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha as Colt and Julianna respectively. Some lines from Julianna have a mischievous tone while others are tinged with spite and growing frustration. For his part, Colt begins unsure of himself and unclear of why this woman has it in for him, but as he learns more, he becomes confident, choosing to engage in the verbal jousts and starting getting under her skin. The constant back and forths between the two is genuinely a joy to listen to and the writing is sharp to make the development of their relationship feel natural.The main focus of Colt's attention, however, is the aforementioned Visionaries who need to be offed, and this is where Deathloop's open-ended gameplay does the heavy lifting. Blackreef is split up into multiple districts, and each one is usually home to at least one of the Visionaries. Colt's objective is to enter an area and figure out how to get himself into a position where he can kill said Visionary and take their Slab, an item that gives them one of the six unique supernatural abilities. But it's not as simple as running into a building and gunning them down as each of the Visionaries is… a weirdo. Charlie, for example, has transformed a part of Updaam into a low-budget escape room made up of multiple themed floors, complete with puzzles and a whole lot of weapon-wielding Eternalists standing between the entrance and him. Harriet has taken up residence in a Karl's Bay hanger, where she's hosting a group wellness session that is as sinister as it sounds. Wenjie is a super smart scientist who is responsible for harnessing the strange energy of the time loop to create the slabs and rarely leaves her lab in The Complex, but you might find yourself facing an existential conundrum when you're face to face with her.Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks ... it delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measureDeathloop's day-and-night cycle also means that these Visionaries are only available at certain times of the day. Although you can manually progress time to your needs, there's only ever a specific window of opportunity to kill a Visionary. That means you need to play through time loops repeatedly, puzzling out a plan to execute it when the time is right. The game makes this more manageable by giving the player Visionary Leads to follow. These are quest chains that guide the player to key pieces of information necessary to pull off the assassination and will often take Colt through different environments at different times of the day. You may need the code to a door in Fristad Rock, for example, but a ledger with that information is being stored in an office elsewhere that can only be accessed when a worker leaves the door open in the afternoon.The result of this approach is that you're slowly trained to develop a meticulous understanding of each area in the game. And as your Colt grows in strength and capabilities, so too does your proficiency in navigating them. After killing a Visionary you gain a power, which can be used in the following time loops, provided you invest in it. This growth comes by way of Residuum that can be extracted from charged objects in the environment or, in more abundance, from the dead body of a Visionary. By channeling this resource into weapons and items, you're able to hold onto them between loops. Slab powers are the most essential as they give you a significant ability, and killing a Visionary repeatedly to take their slab will evolve the power. The Shift power, for example, lets you teleport much like Dishonored's Blink. But by repeatedly killing the Visionary wielding it and collecting it, you're able to upgrade the power to let you travel further or hover in the air briefly. Aether lets you turn invisible but becomes more effective if you upgrade it so its effect doesn't wear off when you attack.Along with powers, Trinkets are also littered throughout the world and come in two flavors. Weapon trinkets can be used to augment your combat abilities by improving stats like range, power, and aim-down-sights speed. Personal trinkets, meanwhile, enhance Colt's performance by improving health regeneration, decreasing the amount of noise he makes when moving, or adjusting how his power meter depletes and recovers, among other things. And these all come in multiple color-coded tiers of effectiveness. The presence of these is what makes each time loop consistently rewarding to play through, even if you fail to achieve a bigger objective. Sometimes it can be good to do a run through an area or even an entire loop to build your Residuum balance and collect some more trinkets, especially since it's also an opportunity to refine your chosen playstyle a bit more. There's nothing quite like deciding to run into an area with your guns blazing just so you can chew through Eternalists and a Visionary, knowing that you're doing it just to grab resources. Since Colt is able to come back from death twice, there is a degree of forgiveness in the game that really encourages doing wacky things when the opportunity arises. That third death will reset the loop entirely though, so some strategy is also required if you want to make the most of your time.Very quickly, you'll find yourself developing a level of mastery over the world thanks to the powers and weapons that you've accumulated. A Visionary kill that initially took 20 minutes can be reduced to just a couple as you dart around environments, stealthing through one group of enemies, while laying siege to another, and ultimately cutting through your target before they've even realized what's happening. The repetition-based design of Deathloop eases you into creating a flow state that you can enter into and exit from at will. With the character development systems, it gamifies trial and error so effectively that failures almost always still feel like small triumphs. This might sound typical, given the prominence of recent roguelite games such as Hades, but Deathloop's gameplay feels entirely of its own brand, and that is because it's built on the foundation of Arkane's domino-effect design.That is especially apparent as you uncover dead ends, of which there are many scattered around Deathloop's various environments. Documents peppered around the world will provide a small lead on something, which is then marked as a discovery, and the game does an excellent job of creating a breadcrumb trail around Blackreef for you to follow, and it always leads to something meaningful. Whether it's finding the code to open a locked door you stumbled upon hours ago or figuring out how to manipulate two Visionaries into appearing at the same place at the same time, you're never more than a run or two away from having an epiphany. And when it dawns upon you, the feeling will make you giddy. It's like using just the right wrench to loosen a nut that felt like it was impossibly tight.In many regards, Deathloop is a game about being meticulous, and Arkane has done a fantastic job in making just being in the world, looking around, and listening to it enthralling. It should come as no surprise that Blackreef is absolutely stunning to behold, given the strong sense of art direction the studio's previous games have had. Each of the four areas of the game has a distinct style, which changes depending on the time of day thanks to lighting and even weather effects. There's a wonderful retro pop-art motif that runs throughout, with eye-catching posters and signs that not only furnish each environment to be visually pleasing, but also serve as a kind of pathway for the player to explore. Architecture is constructed thoughtfully so, in any given scenario, you can see a way in and a way out. On the ground level, a neon billboard may draw your attention, revealing scaffolding that can be clambered up to give you a better vantage point. Or a spotlight on a stone wall may gesture towards an open window, offering a way into a building that otherwise seems impregnable.Of particular note are the '60s-esque interiors that are somehow both beautiful and utterly garish in the way only retro furniture can be. Wooden walls, shocking red pleather couches that look like they would make your arse numb after a minute of sitting on them, and oddly contorted lighting fixtures will stop you in your tracks so you can ogle how strange they are. But they also fit into the aesthetic so perfectly that you can't help but be impressed by the interior design chops being displayed. Needless to say, Arkane's sense of art direction remains impeccable and, for my money, unmatched.And complementing it is the raucous soundtrack that is as eclectic and as unexpected as the visual stylings. Continuing the mashup of style and themes, Deathloop transitions effortlessly between disparate styles to suit the needs of the moment from a cinematic standpoint, but also has you tapping your feet along to the chaos happening on screen. One minute you're creeping through underground tunnels, backed by the bleeps, bloops, and ambient warbles of old sci-fi movies in tense stealth sections, and the next you're engaged in an all-out gunfight with hordes of Eternalists to the sound of a big band orchestra and off-the-chain sax solos. Deathloop's gunplay is weighty and satisfying, and a great deal of the thrill that comes from trading lead is elevated by the brilliant, funky soundtrack.The final piece to Deathloop's gameplay puzzle is multiplayer, which manifests itself in two ways. The first is technically not multiplayer, as it sees Julianna invade Colt's game to try and assassinate him. This Julianna is computer-controlled but no less deadly for it. At random points, the game announces that Julianna has invaded and locked the exit points out the area. The only way to escape is to hack a specific point to unlock the exit tunnels, but to do that you have to go through her. These moments are genuinely terrifying, especially when you're on a good run. Julianna is capable of masking her appearance to look like any random Eternalist, so she could really be anywhere and anyone. And when she does have you in her crosshairs you better hope you have her in yours. She can be ruthless, but the reward for taking her out is massive. She will often drop a Slab, meaning you can acquire powers or upgrades without needing to kill the Visionary who has them. And if you're smart, you can even set up elaborate traps using turrets and grenades to get the jump on her.Of course, a human player--someone on your friends list, a random person on the internet, or even you--can choose to protect the loop by assuming the role of Julianna. As the hunter, you invade Colt's world with the goal of taking him out before he can kill you or escape. Unlike Colt, who has that ability to undo his deaths a couple of times, Julianna has just one shot at her mark, which means you need to be much more considered. However, the ability to mimic NPCs is a devious advantage that is much more effective than you might think, especially if you have a good understanding of the world and can use a player's knowledge against them.For example, you may know that there's a specific enemy that is always positioned in a specific spot and, if you're able to swap positions with them, the Colt player may just assume you're a harmless Eternalist, only for you to strike when they least suspect it. You can also use powers that are unlocked gradually as you continue to invade players. Julianna has her own progression tree that tasks her with completing feats such as successfully killing Colt in a specific way, surviving for a certain period of time, using a particular weapon, and so on. As you complete these, more Slab abilities, weapons, and trinkets become available, making you a deadlier killer. The sense of tension this introduces to gameplay is exhilarating as you never know when a Julianna could appear to turn your world upside down. It harkens back to the kind of hide-and-seek multiplayer introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the PvP of the Soulsborne games, and it works really well within Deathloop. Of course, you can opt not to allow people to invade if you'd prefer a purely single-player experience."
450,Super Mario 3D All-Stars,8.0,2,"Super Mario 3D All-Stars is now available on Nintendo Switch. The collection is a limited-time release; physical and digital editions will only be on sale until March 31, 2021, after which point it will no longer be available from retailers or the Nintendo eShop. However, those who purchase the collection digitally will still be able to redownload it after that date. Our full review of Super Mario 3D All-Stars follows.Super Mario 3D All-Stars, a Switch compilation featuring a trio of the plumber's most influential adventures: N64's Super Mario 64, GameCube's Super Mario Sunshine, and Wii's Super Mario Galaxy.But while Mario 3D All-Stars is ostensibly a celebration of Mario's history, a chance to revisit the plumber's genre-defining leap into the third dimension, it's still lacking in some regards. For one, you won't find anything in the way of supplemental material here: just Mario's first three 3D adventures, modestly touched up for high-definition displays, and their accompanying soundtracks. The presentation is minimal but handsomely designed, and the soundtracks are a nice bonus, but the package on the whole hardly feels like a celebration of the series in the way that, say, Kirby's Dream Collection or even the original Super Mario All-Stars did.Still, the games that are included here are some of Mario's most memorable, and they've all been given an HD sheen. Mario 64 runs in 720p whether you're playing on the television or in handheld mode, while Sunshine and Galaxy both run in 1080p docked and 720p in handheld. Sunshine's aspect ratio has also been increased to 16:9. Thanks to the improved resolution, the games all look more vibrant and colorful than ever, which helps mask their otherwise aging visuals; Galaxy in particular has benefited greatly from the HD touchup and is often stunning. The UI elements in each game look much crisper as well, and the in-game text has been updated to reflect the tweaked controls (and in Mario 64's case, the fuzzy font has been smoothed over, making it much easier to read).Beyond those nips and tucks, however, 3D All-Stars presents the three classics in their original, unvarnished forms. Outside of modified controls to better suit the Switch hardware, Nintendo has not altered the content of these games, so they arrive on Switch with all of their original highlights and blemishes intact. As such, the appeal of this collection hinges entirely on the strength of the games themselves, and they have all weathered the test of time with varying degrees of grace.As the oldest game in the compilation, Mario 64 has aged the most noticeably--something that is immediately apparent in the controls. While Mario himself still feels as spry and acrobatic as ever, boasting the widest repertoire of moves he's ever had, he doesn't feel quite as sharp to maneuver as he once did; his turn radius is a bit unwieldy and his walk a little too jittery, which often makes it difficult to guide him across narrow pathways or line him up to read signposts or speak to other characters.The biggest sticking point, however, is the camera system. Pioneering as it was in 1996, the camera--which is charmingly personified as a Lakitu reporter filming Mario live as he investigates Princess Peach's disappearance--is often an impediment, restrictive at the best of times and combative at the worst. You can only shift the camera angle around in increments, but even then it has a tendency to drift back behind Mario, making it difficult to frame jumps and other actions that require tightrope precision. This can get particularly frustrating in some of the game's later stages, where death-defying leaps become the norm and you'll need to rely on the camera to gauge your trajectory.Given the game's age, however, these flaws are to be expected, and they're largely overshadowed by its many enduring strengths. While the ideas here would be reinterpreted and refined by later games in the series, Mario 64's sense of adventurousness remains undiminished. Princess Peach's castle, the game's labyrinthine hub, is laden with secrets to uncover, and it remains a joy to explore, rewarding curiosity with hidden stars and secret stages. The game is particularly clever in the way it builds expectations only to later subvert them. You'll spend your first handful of hours learning that levels are accessed via paintings, only for the game to disguise the entrance to one later stage as a nondescript wall. These little moments of discovery are plentiful and always feel rewarding to stumble upon.The courses, likewise, still feel rich and varied--15 in total (not counting the handful of secret micro levels squirreled away around Peach's castle) running the gamut from grasslands and snow-covered mountains to towering fortresses and clockwork contraptions. Mario 64 pioneered the episodic structure that later 3D Mario games would follow, so you'll be revisiting stages and completing different objectives each time to collect stars; some are waiting in plain sight at the end of a treacherous obstacle course, while others are rewarded for performing specific tasks, such as reuniting a lost penguin with its mother or besting a fleet-footed Koopa in a race. The game's novelty on the whole may have been somewhat diminished by the passage of time, but it is still often able to surprise and delight.For many, Mario Sunshine is likely the most intriguing game in this collection. Part of that has to do with its rarity. Unlike the other two games here, Sunshine has never received a proper re-release; the only official way to experience it until now was to pick up the GameCube original. Part of it also has to do with its reputation; Sunshine is commonly regarded as something of an odd duck among the Mario series, a game with as many detractors as advocates, and it's much easier to see why when it's juxtaposed with two of Mario's most acclaimed outings.Much of it boils down to the clumsily named Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device, or FLUDD--a water-spewing contraption that Mario wears on his back throughout most of the adventure. While the plumber is still able to leap and slide around levels with acrobatic abandon, FLUDD is his primary means of interacting with the world around him in Sunshine; you'll use it to battle bosses, hit far-off panels, and clean up goop, while additional nozzles give FLUDD the ability to launch Mario into the air like a rocket or zip him around at high speeds.In the same way that Mario 64 showcased the N64's analog stick, FLUDD was a showpiece for the GameCube controller's analog shoulder buttons. Pressing down on the right trigger lightly would let Mario spray water while moving, while holding the trigger down fully stopped him in his tracks and allowed you to aim more precisely. Since the Switch controller lacks analog triggers, these actions have been divided up between the ZR and R buttons, respectively. This requires a bit of a mental adjustment if you've played the original game, and you'll have no choice but to adapt to the change since 3D All-Stars inexplicably doesn't support the original GameCube controls (despite the fact you can technically play it with a GC controller through its adapter), but it functions just as well as the original setup.Sunshine is commonly regarded as something of an odd duck among the Mario series, a game with as many detractors as advocates, and it's much easier to see why when it's juxtaposed with two of Mario's most acclaimed outings.The heavy reliance on FLUDD, however, places Sunshine in stark contrast to other Mario games, largely because you never feel as completely in control of the action. This is especially true in stages that task you to steer a boat or lily pad around a body of water. In these situations, you'll need to spray a stream of water from FLUDD to propel the boat forward. The problem, however, is that it's next to impossible to maneuver the vehicle with any degree of finesse this way, so you'll be clumsily ramming it into walls as you try to steer around obstacles. Another level requires you to flip panels over and form a picture using FLUDD, but this likewise turns into an exercise in frustration as the stream of water you spray isn't accurate enough to hit a single panel; there will almost always be a stray splash that hits adjacent panels, causing them to flip over as well.Situations like this are prevalent in Sunshine and illustrate how uneven it feels compared to other Mario games. It's never as inventive or adventurous as 64 or Galaxy, nor is it as meticulously crafted; its challenges are not as finely tuned, and many of the objectives it throws at you feel like busywork to extend your playtime. Even the presentation is a mess. Sunshine is famous for being the first Mario game to feature fully voiced cutscenes (if you don't count Peach's brief snippets of dialogue in Mario 64). This would be laudable were it not for the fact that the cutscenes and voice work are truly terrible, so much so that no other Mario game would use fully voiced dialogue again.That's not to say the title is completely devoid of any merit, however. Even with all these faults, there are plenty of aspects to like about Sunshine, particularly its setting, Isle Delfino--a Hawaii-by-way-of-the-Mushroom-Kingdom tropical island spanning seven levels and numerous hidden one-off challenges. In keeping with the tropical theme, all of the areas you visit are designed to resemble island locales, from an amusement park to a port harbor spiderwebbed with catwalks. These levels are all charmingly realized and feel like genuine areas rather than playpens designed around Mario's abilities. This gives Sunshine the strongest sense of place of any 3D Mario game, and it's fun to simply run about the levels and soak in the scenery.Another highlight are the ""secret"" stages--straightforward obstacle courses more akin to traditional Mario levels. Here, Mario is stripped of FLUDD and must rely on old-fashioned platforming acumen to navigate his way to the goal. These stages feel like direct precursors to the linear, planet-hopping challenges of Galaxy, and they're among the game's best ideas. Without the safety net FLUDD provides, even a single jump between moving platforms becomes a hair-raising leap of faith. Like Sunshine overall, some of these stages can frustrate, but their charms ultimately outweigh their flaws.Mario's first Wii adventure rounds out the collection, and it holds up as the best of the bunch, as fresh and exciting to play now as when it first launched back in 2007. Much of that has to do with the game's pacing; contrasted with the meandering and uneven challenges in Sunshine, Galaxy is sharply focused, paring back the sandbox-style levels of previous 3D Mario games for a more linear series of challenges. Although the stages don't offer as much room for exploration, the variety of ideas within each is delightful. Galaxy never stays in one place for very long, throwing a series of micro objectives at you en route to the Power Star waiting at the end of every stage; you'll go from carefully guiding a bubble-encased Mario through a minefield to navigating haphazard platforms that are constructed out of space debris right in front of you.The entire adventure unspools at a rapid clip as well; new galaxies open up after every few stars you collect, enticing you to keep playing. Moreover, many of the levels are one-off challenges designed around a specific gameplay idea that's usually never revisited, making them constantly surprising. Not all of the ideas the game proposes are winners; those that are designed around controller gimmicks, such as the motion-controlled manta surfing challenges, aren't as fun or inspired as the other stages, but the game never lingers on one idea for long, whisking you off to the next challenge and idea before you grow frustrated.Given that it was originally designed around motion controls, Mario Galaxy has received the most substantial control tweaks in its move to Switch. You can still play the game Wii-style with one Joy-Con in each hand, and this setup still feels like the most natural way to experience the adventure, as it most easily lets you maneuver Mario around and use the pointer functionality simultaneously. Because the Switch lacks a sensor bar, however, you'll need to manually re-center the reticle often, but this is done easily enough simply by pressing the R button, making it a nonissue.Beyond the more traditional control setup, you also have the option to play the game with a Pro Controller, and this is a fine alternative. Mario's spin attack can be executed with a press of the Y button, so you won't need to shake the controller constantly to attack enemies or activate Star Launchers the way you would with the Wii's motion controls, but you will still need to physically move it to aim the pointer around the screen and navigate the small handful of motion-controlled stages. In handheld mode, the touch screen serves as a substitute for pointer functionality. This works well enough for simple actions like using Pull Stars, but it's a less than ideal workaround, as it's much trickier to move Mario and use pointer controls simultaneously. You'll also need to physically tilt the system for any motion-controlled challenges; the aforementioned manta surfing level, for instance, requires you to tilt the Switch left and right like a steering wheel to turn the manta ray. It's a serviceable-enough solution, but it doesn't feel as natural as playing with two Joy-Cons.Taken all together, Mario 3D All-Stars is a worthwhile collection, featuring the best versions of Mario 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy to appear on a Nintendo system. Although the individual games have been sparingly touched up and there's little in the way of ancillary material to pore over, the titles themselves hold up well and are a delight to revisit. Despite their age, the games are still rife with inventive ideas and surprises, which more than makes up for the collection's presentational shortcomings."
2948,Driver: Renegade,4.0,0,"     You play as series mainstay John Tanner, an ex-cop who's hired by one of New York's big political figures to rid the city's streets of crime. Doing so requires you to mercilessly drive your car around like a lunatic and bash into any enemy vehicles that try to stop you--and that's pretty much the extent of what Driver: Renegade 3DS has to offer. For the most part, the driving is solid but completely unremarkable. Individual cars (which are unlocked after completing missions) handle according to their relative stats, and also make use of a ""rage bar."" The bar recharges during drifts and stunts, giving you access to a temporary speed boost and the ability to destroy assailants using shunts.   you. Spinning out and knocking against other cars or parts of the environment rapidly drains the stability of your car, meaning that deaths are often unfair and unpredictable.      The Story mode is light on interesting exposition, and the incredibly hammy dialogue and voice acting are executed with absolutely no subtlety whatsoever. Brief motion comics highlight the paper-thin narrative, and its justifications for throwing you into missions are poorly conceived. Tanner himself, who has been relatively stoic in the past, is inexplicably transformed into an archetypal tough guy who shamefully spouts a small selection of bad one-liners and puns ad nauseam. The game desperately tries to appear edgy with gratuitous swearing; and there are embarrassing attempts at titillation via the introduction of a sultry female character, but all of its efforts are awkwardly juvenile. It also takes no more than three hours to get through the story's 20 missions, although the game actually runs out of tricks by about half that length. There's a separate Career mode as well, which allows you to compete in specific events pulled from the main game, including time trials and eliminator races. However, it's essentially the same content without the shoddy narrative in between, so you won't feel much desire to carry on playing past the fleeting Story mode. While you can use StreetPass to exchange scores and records, multiplayer of any kind is a no-show--not even local play is included.       The polygonal city you ride and smash around in is a hollow and vaguely open-world map with a noticeable lack of life on the surrounding streets. Every inch of the city feels empty on a drastic scale: Traffic is extremely light and the absence of everyday citizens galloping from the path of your speeding car seems strangely at odds with the conventions of the series. It also doesn't help that everything looks so washed out and jagged.  Plus, the shoddy use of stereoscopic 3D adds nothing to the visuals--it's much more comfortable to play with the slider turned all the way down. On the plus side, the soundtrack is tolerable and the menus are generally well produced; in fact, they are arguably the most impressive aspect of the entire game.      From its overwhelming repetition to its tepid attempts to be cool and irreverent, Driver: Renegade 3D is a game that fails to create an action-driving hybrid that is even remotely engaging. Its solid driving mechanics have been squandered on a game that is far too boring, and the end result is a product that feels consistently rough and flawed in every way.  "
3533,Metal Slug XX,6.0,1,"Metal Slug 7, released for the Nintendo DS at the end of 2008, so be aware that you might have played this game before. And while the action is insanely intense and boasts a great co-op mode, like all good side-scrollers that trace their family trees back to the 1990s, the game is very short and the price is awfully high at 1,200 points.        If you know what you're getting, Metal Slug XX can be a hell of a ride. As in the rest of the franchise going back to its debut on the NeoGeo in 1996, the action is all about running and gunning. In both the seven-level solo/co-op campaign and the single-player-only combat training mode where you fight dozens of quickie one-off battles, you go up against the evil General Morden's regular troops plus his new cadre of future soldiers wearing helmets with antennas. Not that you need to care about any of this story stuff. All you have to understand is that you've got to kill everything in sight while jumping around and activating the odd platform.     Gameplay is identical to the previous Metal Slugs, which in turn ripped off earlier scrolling shooters, such as Contra. The only real difference between the Metal Slug series and its predecessors is a reliance on murderous tank vehicles called slugs. Whereas something like Super C forced you to mostly blast it out on terra firma, here you frequently get the chance to wreak havoc while driving tanks, mechs, and even giant mechanical ostriches. Difficulty in the campaign is just brutal when going it alone, even if you play on beginner with unlimited continues, because the levels are geared for co-op play either locally or over the smooth and lag-free Xbox Live connection. One enemy shot takes you out, so you can easily find yourself stuck in a rut of getting killed over and over again in difficult sections of levels.     Despite this level of difficulty, it can be hard to walk away, especially when buddying up with a friend to take on the campaign as a team in co-op. Everything gets a touch monotonous at times, because Metal Slug XX doesn't mix up enemy assault waves as much as it should, but the pace is always snappy even when the never-ending stream of enemy soldiers, tanks, mortars, and choppers makes you want to cry uncle. This is one of those nutso shooters that hit you with so much running and gunning that you never get the chance to think long enough to decide to stop playing. The game's brevity also keeps you going, as you can finish the seven brief levels in a single 60-minute session as long as you're playing on easy or in co-op. So you just keep going until you're done, which is long after you realize that you're doing the same thing over and over again.         Virtually nothing has been done to update Metal Slug XX for the Xbox 360. So you get an old game with a new (misleading) name. The visuals look a lot like those seen in handheld versions of the game, simply blown up to fill a TV screen. Well, almost fill a TV screen. The graphics haven't even been adapted for widescreen presentation, so the game is shown in 4:3 with buffers filling in the gaps on widescreen TVs. At any rate, the visuals are plagued by big pixels, blurry backgrounds, and many head-spinning scenes where so many jagged projectiles fill the screen that you never see the bullet with your name on it.    High School Musical theatrics in their death throes. Even the way the game dishes out power-ups is cute: you obtain rockets, lasers, and the like from rescued POWs with Rip Van Winkle beards. And announcements, such as when you acquire power-ups, are broadcast in '90s-era arcade voices--brassy shouted slogans in front of what often sounds like 16-bit sound effects and music. None of this is anything close to cutting edge, but it does establish a quirky old-time console atmosphere.     For 1,200 points, you should get more than just this rough port of a year-old DS game that can be finished in one sitting. Metal Slug XX is still a playable side-scrolling shooter with a fair number of good points, most notably the great co-op, but the disappointing nature of the port and the fact that it offers little replay value make it tough to recommend.  "
2510,Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward,8.0,2,"Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors for the DS, a horror-themed adventure game mixing visual-novel-type storytelling scenes and character interaction with puzzle-laden rooms that you needed to escape. The warm reception of that game has now yielded a sequel in Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward--and it's just as enthralling as its predecessor.         Virtue's Last Reward begins with the protagonist, a college student named Sigma, waking up in an elevator next to a strange woman who seems to know more about him than she's letting on. A strange rabbit creature appears on a monitor near them, telling them that they must figure out how to escape the car before it falls. Once they do, they find themselves in an abandoned warehouse with seven other abducted individuals. The creature appears again, telling them that they must all play the Ambidex game to escape their industrial prison. The Ambidex game involves puzzles, traps, and important decisions to either trust or betray your fellow players. The penalty for losing or failing to comply is death, or possibly an even worse fate.     The game is divided into two distinct sections. As Sigma, you team up with groups of your fellow captives and explore various rooms of this mysterious facility. These rooms are the escape portion of the game: you investigate a room for items, clues, and puzzles to solve, piecing things together until you are finally able to unlock a safe containing an item to allow you to exit.     The story- and dialogue-heavy portions of the game are the novel portions, which appear in between the escape sections and elaborate on the various mysteries the game presents. You also have the opportunity to make choices that influence the path the game's plot takes. The game's use of the term ""novel"" to refer to these sections is apt: there's a massive amount of text in Virtue's Last Reward, but because the writing is superb and the voice-over work for the supporting cast (available in both English and Japanese) is excellent, the hours upon hours of dialogue you page through are a pleasure to experience.        The quality of storytelling is a key factor in an adventure game, and Virtue's Last Reward passes that test with flying colors. The game's plot immediately grabs you and rarely lets go, going from a creepy horror premise to interpersonal character drama to mind-blowing sci-fi concepts expertly. The promise of unraveling the many mysteries--Why are we here? Who are these other people? What purpose do the Ambidex game and the room puzzles serve? What is this facility?--keep you engaged, and the many new mysteries that appear throughout give you even more reasons to keep playing for hours on end as solutions dangle tantalizingly in front of you, just beyond the reach of the next puzzle.       You also make choices throughout the course of the game that determine the path the story takes during your playthrough, some of which can be truly agonizing. The Ambidex game challenges you to put your trust in the other in-game characters, which you can choose to either ally with for attempted mutual benefit or betray for increased personal gain. Each choice you make leads to a different branching story path with a different set of rooms and revelations. Unlike Nine Hours, where you had to constantly restart the game to see new paths, Virtue's Last Reward gives you a flowchart that lets you jump back to previous events and choices at any time. It's a great addition that allows you to go back to critical points without playing through the same puzzles over and over--and in order to solve the game's most pervasive mysteries, you need to take several different paths and see many possible endings. Thankfully, handy auto-text and skip functions exist to let you fast-forward through dialogue you may have already seen.      In fact, the whole interface of Virtue's Last Reward is an improvement. Notes you find containing hints to puzzle solutions are stored in a handy file, and a touch-screen memo function can be called upon at any time for you to write down and recall your own discoveries. The Vita's large, touch-sensitive screen makes reading dialogue, finding small details, and moving around a breeze, though the game may have trouble picking up on tinier objects and elements you're trying to tap on if you have large fingers. And if you find yourself truly stumped, you can now swap the puzzle difficulty from hard to easy, which affects the number and the content of hints that your partner characters drop.    There are a few minor quibbles with the game, however. Occasionally Sigma suffers from some unexplained personality shifts, going from dead serious to flirtatious and jokey at the drop of a hat. While the shifts don't affect the story greatly, they do get a little bit jarring. Although all of the supporting characters in the novel sequences are fully voiced, the dialogue in the escape portions is the all-too-familiar sound of text-printing blips and squeaks.   Finally, the way you obtain the bonus archive files that detail some of the game's backstory can be annoying. Each escape sequence has a safe that can be opened with two code combinations: one gives a key to leave, while the other gives a special file containing several archives. Oftentimes the latter is considerably more difficult to acquire, since it typically involves finding a very obtuse second solution to an existing puzzle. You may find yourself torn between leaving a room and proceeding with the story or trying to figure out how to get the extra files--if you leave and try to get the files later, you may be stuck doing the whole escape portion again. Further, you get only a portion of the available bonus files in each room if you play on easy mode, though thankfully, entering the same password to the safe upon revisiting the room on hard difficulty coughs up the missing materials with no effort required.      Among the many games released each year, there aren't many that leave you contemplating and debating their story and worldviews long after the final set of credits has rolled. Virtue's Last Reward takes its place proudly among this crop of games. As fun and challenging as the brainteasers in the room escapes are, they're merely dressing for the fantastic writing, memorable characters, and stunning plot twists that could only be presented successfully in a game format. This is an adventure that fans of the genre--or those who appreciate quality storytelling in general--should not miss.  "
1507,FIFA 16,9.0,2," really know how you feel about that game until you’ve played it for months; Loved it, hated it, loved it again, and then decided it’s, you know, alright for a game you’ve played for 300 hours. everything. FIFA 16 feels like learning a new game. It’s hard, and the first few games are a mixture of frustration and promise. FIFA 15’s dominating tactic of high balls out to the wing where fast man will get behind the defence. EA Sports' latest soccer sim wants players to compete on a level footing. And while, realistically, we’ll have to wait until the online population has stress-tested the new system for millions of hours and reported back before we’ll really know, this is how the changes currently feel. Defending is easier. Or at least, defenders are now better equipped to win the ball and compete against attacking players. Slide tackles have regained some of the old potency; players really do slide again, meaning it’s possible to win the ball from unexpected distance. Well-timed toe-pokes, meanwhile, can satisfyingly break up play, while desperate moments give players more options to deliberately foul players just before they break into space (this is usually harshly punished, but so much fun). I’ve been caught by defenders when I thought I was out of range, I’ve won the ball with crunching block-tackles at fullback, and I’ve used the slide to channel runners by blocking off their path. This new, stronger, more flexible slide tackling is a success. Other noticeable additions to defending include a tackle feint, for counter-baiting tricksy opponents during one-on-one battles. No longer does the protect-the-ball crab pose offer an impenetrable defence; it’s easier to slip around players in possession of the ball and then get a foot to it. Perhaps most significantly of all, defender AI has been fine-tuned to make more interceptions and to track runners with more doggedness. These last points are the ones that really contribute to FIFA 16’s most obvious shift; the fact that the midfield is now a battlefield. Working the ball through the middle of the park feels attritional and muddy, full of physicality and friction. More than ever, it’s a game of inches and interceptions, with defenders urging themselves towards the ball wherever possible, pressing and lunging and reaching out feet. It can get scrappy, with miscontrols and turnovers spilling messily around for a few seconds at a time, but it feels like an organic sort of mess, a footballing mess. In response to all this there are offensive tools to make the midfield an even fight, if an asymmetrical one. No-touch dribbling adds another layer to the game’s skill system, enabling players to duck and feint over the ball, looking to send defenders the wrong way. This is pretty but so far, for me, not hugely effective; I rarely had enough space in-field to dance over the ball, and on the wings I went for reliable old step-overs. But more integral is the new precision passing system, which effectively introduces a hard, pinged pass that can be pulled off by holding R1 (RB). It’s clearly been designed as a foil to the stickier, interception-prone midfield, and it comes with an element of risk and skill. Lesser players are more likely to fumble these stinging passes, and judging angles, ability and distance adds a new dimension to the basics of FIFA’s play. The result of all of this is that FIFA 16 is full of scrappy back and forth, the ability to play patient possession football, and a greater range of passing than ever. The dominance of pace in last year's game is over, although sometimes it does seem as though it has been offed through foul means, with through-balls, for instance, feeling conspicuously limited, unwilling to put players in the clear either up the lines or over the top of defences. But for the most part the new style of play--slower, grittier, but still skilled--seems like it’s been achieved through nurturing rather than nerfing. And so that is everything, in terms of its gameplay pillars, which no doubt is the area on which I place the most importance when judging FIFA. But FIFA’s success during the last few years has been as much to do with the collecting and trading compulsions of Ultimate Team as it’s been about actual (pretend) football. So the arrival of Draft mode, a significant addition to Ultimate Team, is also worth a good look. Draft mode sits aside from the main business of buying packs, building teams, and playing them against opposition online. It’s like a paid-entry one-off Ultimate Team tournament, in which players build a temporary team position by position, opening a pack for every slot and deciding which player inside best fits the side under construction. The finished team is then played against other Draft players, with bigger than usual coin rewards for a winning run (the maximum streak is four wins). Putting aside the longstanding misgivings about how Ultimate Team commodifies the magic of football, and how it sort of encourages kids to gamble, it’s great. Draft takes the pleasure of building a team--piecing together strong chemistry, the thrill of opening packs--and gives it to you without the need to pull your main team apart. It costs 15,000 coins (or 300 microtransaction FIFA points) to enter, and of course Draft mode is, in the end, about making more money. But that’s OK if it’s something worth paying for, and Draft offers something more substantial than the chance to simply reveal a randomised selection of players. Building a new team is a complex puzzle that’s different with each Draft, and winning a few games delivers substantial rewards (my first four-game winning streak gave me a total return of around 60,000 coins, which is a fine start to the season). FIFA needed a year like this. Without serious competition from Konami’s PES in the past few years (until now), and with Ultimate Team keeping players playing and paying all year round, there’s been no pressing motivation to ring the changes. Annual titles will always evolve gradually, but recent progress has felt glacial. FIFA 16 can be stubborn and stifling, but it feels gloriously new, and having to learn fresh strategies and nuances in a game series like this is an almost-forgotten pleasure."
2482,Karateka (2012),6.0,1,"   The Karate Kid was still sweeping the country after the film's release that summer. It was innovative at the time, designed by Jordan Mechner of Prince of Persia fame, complete with engaging cinematics and fluid combat movements that once seemed impossible considering the limitations of the Apple II. As was par for the course in those days, the story involved little more than saving the princess Mariko (a blonde, much like the hero himself) from the clutches of the evil warlord Akuma, but the whole experience benefited from touches of humor, such as the way Mariko could kill the hero in one hit if he had the gall to approach her in fighting stance. Elsewhere, if you inserted the floppy disk upside down, the action on the screen would unfold upside down.      In the modern incarnation, that humor is gone. Drawing on Karateka's inherent simplicity, Mechner instead attempts to transform the whole into an emotional mix of artistry and fun. Gone are the Caucasian protagonists, for instance; in their place, a cast of Japanese warriors and monks spar among pretty cel-shaded temples and pathways. It works, for the most part, and the occasional flashes of stunning scenery make it easy to appreciate. Even though you watch the heroes you control run up arcing passageways, Karateka is as bound to rails as Japan's Shinkansen lines, and you'll find that you can't even retreat to pick up the health-granting flowers your heroes may have passed along the way.        Still, the three heroes provide this incarnation's most intriguing feature, with each hero granting access to a different ending. The first hero is Mariko's true love, a dashing fellow with a ponytail who can take only about half as many hits as the others. Reaching Mariko with him affords the best ending, while his comparative lack of hit points afford the most challenge. Should he die, though, the monk steps up in his place. Karateka, already easy, suddenly becomes easier, because the monk can take many more hits than Mariko's dashing but flimsy boyfriend.      But should you fail even with him, you can still fall back on the hulking brute, whose goofy animations and massive girth are reminiscent of Popeye's Bluto, and seem out of place in this serene animated world. He has a good heart--as you see in a brief flashback that reveals his love for Mariko--but it's clear from her conflicted gratitude at the end that he's the last choice in both position and preference.      The problem, unfortunately, is that all three heroes play the same. Karateka's combat never gets more difficult than taking on the foes who confront the heroes one by one and then timing your blocks, which then allows you to whale on them through normal and heavy attacks. Perform well enough at this, and you fill a chi meter that grants access to a helpful stun. The only difference between the three protagonists lies in the true love's meager health pool. You can master this system on your very first playthrough, especially once you realize that the musical cues in the background announce the pattern of incoming attacks in most fights. Three plinks on a shasimen, for instance, heralds three incoming blows; a lazy string glide heralds a massive single attack; and a flurry of notes announces a rapid cascade of punches and kicks. While not without a welcome dash of beauty, combat is so predictable that only Akuma's huge health pool poses any real threat, along with Akuma's hawk, which torments the heroes periodically as they make their way up to Akuma's citadel.       In Karateka's favor, the game lasts as long as it should considering the simplicity of its design; the downside is that this amounts to a mere 30 minutes. That's all, and for 800 Microsoft points to boot. At that price, it's worth wondering why Liquid Entertainment didn't include the original as a bonus for completing the achievements. There's minor replay value in store if you would like to reach Mariko with her true love or win the game without ever letting the foes land a hit, but if you're particularly focused, it's possible to score the majority of the 12 achievements in a single playthrough.      Such a short running time wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if the overall experience lingered with you long after its completion. It's a shame, then, that Karateka's easy combat is so disappointing. Even the rich cinematics don't lift Karateka to greatness, because they depend on a sentimental and predictable ""save the princess"" trope that never manages to distinguish itself regardless of the ending. For all that, it's not without its charms, albeit fleeting ones.  "
534,Sakura Wars,7.0,2,"Sakura Wars is perhaps the most anime game that I've ever played. There are plenty of games out there based on popular anime, yes, but when it comes to feeling like you're an active part of an ongoing, episodic adventure filled with quirky characters, dramatic action, and satisfying melodrama, Sakura Wars has everything else beat. Its structure, charming cast, and whirlwind story help set it apart from other colorful anime-inspired adventures, and, much like the characters whose stories it tells, it manages to overcome many of its flaws to become a satisfying experience in the end.For the uninitiated, the entire concept of Sakura Wars is rather offbeat. This particular game is a semi-reboot of a long-running Japanese game series of the same name, set in an alternate 1940s Japan where steam technology quickly surpassed electricity and history took a very different path. The world's nations, rather than fighting each other in World Wars, took arms against demonic invaders with armies of steam-powered fighting robots called Spiricle Strikers. Oh yes, and these armies also operate semi-covertly as theatre troupes whose members consisted mostly of young women.It's a lot to take in, and it's compounded by the fact that only one other Sakura Wars game has made the voyage Westward, though some related media (like anime and manga adaptations) have seen release here. Still, if you're coming in totally blind to the Sakura Wars concept and mythos, you might find yourself rather confused, particularly when references to previous titles crop up.Sakura Wars does find a way to try to ease you into things, however. You take the role of Seijuro, a disgraced military veteran who has been shuffled off to manage the Combat Revue of the Tokyo Imperial Theatre… a crew consisting of mostly inexperienced greenhorns who can't act or fight their way out of a wet paper bag. They're so bad that they can't even properly protect Tokyo from the demonic forces that have begun to ramp up attacks once again. On top of that, there's a massive international tournament among the combat revues of other major cities happening, and all of the losing teams will be forced to disband. And so you must turn things around for the Imperial Combat Revue--and destroy the demons and maybe find romance in the process.Sakura Wars presents its story in an episodic format, complete with convenient ""intermissions"" at key points in each episode and ""coming-up-next"" style previews once one of the mini-sagas wraps up. Each of the game's nine episodes contain sequences that mix story and character interaction to go along with action portions--though, in most of the episodes, the former takes considerable precedence over the latter, as you spend time connecting with the ragtag crew of the Imperial Theatre and the Combat Revue.It's in these story-heavy portions that the beauty and imagination of both the game's unique setting--an anachronistic, steampunk early-20th-century Tokyo--and its artistic vision manage to really shine. While there aren't many locations in Sakura Wars, they all feel distinct and lively, giving the impression of a familiar yet strange place removed from time. The character designs add to the game's distinct mood, too; besides the young women of the Imperial Combat Revue, you also encounter fighters from London, Shanghai, and Germany, each with their own personality quirks and an appealing visual style that evokes the imagery of their respective nations.You spend most of your time with the women of the Imperial Theatre, though, guiding them through the various challenges and situations throughout the story. The five main Combat Revue fighters are Amamiya Sakura, an optimistic girl-next-door type and Seijuro's childhood friend; Shinonome Hatsuho, a tomboyish shrine maiden with a violent side; Clarissa Snowflake, a shy bookworm with plenty of secrets; Mochizuki Azami, a weird girl with ninja training and a sweet tooth; and Anastasia Palma, a cold, sultry woman whose acting skills are known worldwide. Other theatre crewmembers, like director Sumire, theatre store operator Komachi, and obnoxious mechanic Reiji also support your team from behind the scenes, but those core five are where most of the focus of the story and your interactions lie.Each of these five women are distinct in both looks and personality, and their visual designs (provided by Bleach manga creator Tite Kubo) are beautifully rendered and well-animated throughout, though sometimes the motion capture can feel a little overdone. The Japanese voice acting (there is, unfortunately, no English dub) also brings out the expressiveness of Sakura Wars' character dialogue. Seeing and hearing Clarissa getting flustered because you found her embarrassing story drafts or Sakura finally opening up about some of her painful past experiences makes for some great, memorable moments.It's in these story-heavy portions that the beauty and imagination of both the game's unique setting--an anachronistic, steampunk early-20th-century Tokyo--and its artistic vision manage to really shine. Character-to-character interaction is the meat of most of Sakura Wars' gameplay. During conversations, you'll often be presented with a choice of dialogue options, but there's a twist--these interactions are timed, and taking too long to find the right words (or saying something dumb without thinking) can affect the trust other characters have in you. Has Seijuro found himself in an awkward situation by stumbling into the dressing room at a bad time? You'd better come up with a good explanation, stat! And if you try to be a creepy weirdo, you're going to turn off the women you fight beside really fast, so you must learn how to treat each individual character well.Once you reach a certain point of trust with the main five women fighters, you can start to pursue a more intimate relationship. You may be offered a chance to talk and interact one-on-one in a first-person, private setting where she'll start to divulge more personal feelings and worries, complete with sparkly auras, blushing cheeks, and faces sometimes coming very, very close together. It's over-the-top in the best kind of way.Eventually, however, you will reach points in each chapter where combat needs to happen--either through a portal opening to the demon realm, a random small-scale demonic invasion, or a showcase duel against one of the other global Combat Revues. The bonds you have built through the story come into play here, as the morale of the team directly impacts the fighting prowess of all the individual members in terms of damage dealt and received.That should be a cool little bonus, but unfortunately, Sakura Wars' action combat isn't anything to write home about. It's not a miserable experience, but it's not a particularly exciting one, either. Taking control of one of the Spiricle Strikers (usually with a CPU-controlled companion at your side), you blow through waves of enemies with preset attack combo variations, occasionally dodging with precise timing to enter a slow-motion counterattack mode or initiating a superpowered skill when a special gauge is full. It's standard stuff if you've played 3D action games, and it controls and flows well enough, but there's also nothing noteworthy about it. It's also very easy if you're experienced with action games; few of the encounters put up a real threat aside from battles where you're forced to fight solo, and even those aren't that challenging. The biggest annoyance in combat sequences generally involves random platforming sequences, which would drag the game down a lot more if they weren't fairly rare.Ultimately, combat feels like something of an afterthought--less of a crucial game component and more of a way for the characters to get into situations where they can deliver riveting speeches about the power of friendship and believing in yourself to overcome enemies. Combat (and the story beats it delivers) works well as part of the overall over-the-top melodrama the game's going for, but it's not particularly fun to actually play these portions of the game.Ultimately, combat feels like something of an afterthought--less of a crucial game component and more of a way for the characters to get into situations where they can deliver riveting speeches about the power of friendship and believing in yourself to overcome enemies.The story's twists and turns culminate in a big climax, and while there are plot holes and ""surprises"" seen coming from a mile away, it doesn't matter because it's just so darn entertaining to see this crazy thing unfurl. At about 15 to 20 hours for a first playthrough, Sakura Wars is brief, but there's a fair amount of replayability to be had in redoing certain scenes with different outcomes, finding opportunities for interactions you may have initially missed, or trying to bond with different characters. I enjoyed replaying the game to woo a new paramour, though there aren't more substantial New Game+ options like advanced difficulty levels for combat sequences.My time playing Sakura Wars mirrored the way the Combat Revue grew and changed through the game. Much like Seijuro seeing his team for the first time, I was skeptical that Sakura Wars could adequately pull off what it set out to do. But as I kept playing and the women grew into their roles, I began to warm to it. By the time the curtain fell, I was cheering for the team just as hard as everyone in-game was. The flaws of Sakura Wars are obvious, though a strong focus on melodrama and spectacle makes it a lot easier to gloss over the game's weak points. There's nothing out there quite like Sakura Wars, and if you stick with them, there's a good chance this cast of oddballs will worm their way into your heart too."
2239,Tales of Xillia,7.0,2,"Tales of the Abyss 3DS rerelease and last year's Tales of Graces f for the PlayStation 3. Now, almost two years after Tales of Xillia's Japanese release, Western gamers get to play the game, the series' 15th-anniversary project. But while Xillia has high aspirations, some issues keep it from being the exemplary Tales release that its high profile might suggest.   Tales of Xillia is unique in the series in that it lets you select one of two protagonists at the game's beginning. Jude is a young medical student with some combat training who stumbles upon a dark secret at his school, while Milla is an almost godlike being who is being guided by the world's great spirits to destroy the foul experiments. The two first cross paths as Milla is invading the school's research facility, and a twist of fate results in Milla losing control of her immense powers and the pair going on the lam to escape military forces. Along the way, they meet a variety of enjoyable supporting cast members as is typical for the Tales series: a mercenary with ambiguous motives, a strange little girl with a boisterously chatty (and combat-capable) stuffed critter companion, the girl-next-door best friend/unrequited love, and--perhaps the most interesting of the bunch--a gray-haired, sophisticated combat butler. One of the series' greatest strengths has always been its character interactions, and Tales of Xillia does not disappoint on this front. Cutscenes for important story events are plentiful and are depicted either through animated sequences or well-choreographed, in-engine scenes with full voice-over. Besides presenting story information, these scenes play out in a way that adds a lot of depth to the cast. Optional skits you can choose to view throughout the game use the more typical Japanese role-playing game method of mostly still character portraits augmented by fully voiced dialogue. These skits usually expound upon events encountered in the game, elements of the environment, or particular character quirks. They add a great deal of personality and appeal to the characters. Of course, these wouldn't be as effective if the characters themselves weren't enjoyable to be around. Everyone has a distinct, pleasant personality that makes you want to see more of their exchanges. The world itself is interesting, thanks mostly to the stunning visuals. Tales has always gone for a colorful, anime-inspired look, and the graphics in Xillia play into this perfectly, featuring gorgeous, vivid landscapes and striking architecture. Character models are lovely, with things like Milla's outrageously poofy hair being rendered down to minute details. The camera isn't fixed like in other games in the series, so you can freely explore and enjoy the world's sights from almost any angle you please. There's a ton of in-world terminology being bandied about from the game's outset, but the most engaging element of Xillia's setting--and perhaps the biggest reason to save this world from ruin--is simply how visually sumptuous it is.   Fast-paced, real-time combat is another of Tales' defining elements, and Xillia does not disappoint on this front. You take control of a single character, while the CPU controls the other three based on settings and commands that you specify. Party members and enemies roam freely around the battlefields, exchanging attacks, dodges, and guards with real-time controller motions. Positioning and area-of-effect spells play huge roles in fighting well, along with chaining basic attacks into considerably more damaging (but resource consuming) arte strikes. In addition, some characters can perform ""shifts,"" where certain commands transform an arte into a completely different (and generally more powerful) ability in exchange for making you more vulnerable to enemies. New to Xillia's combat is the ability to link to another party member. By linking to another character, you gain specific benefits, the most immediate of which is that character's support proclivities. Linking with Jude, for example, has him helping to flank enemies, healing you when your HP runs low, and helping you recover from knockdowns. Meanwhile, linking with Rowen allows him to help protect you from foes' magical attacks. A gauge in the lower left corner of the screen fills as blows are traded, and when it reaches certain points, you have the chance to execute a powerful link arte at the end of combo strings with your linked partner. When the gauge fills completely, you can go into ""over limit,"" which allows unlimited link artes to be chained together for a brief period of time. Links between your controlled character and others can be swapped at will during fights--even during link chains, with the right timing--so learning to use them well adds a great deal of depth to fighting. There are some questionable design decisions that make the experience less than what it should be. Outside of combat, character abilities can be augmented through individual characters' lillium orbs, which are geometric grids with stat gains, skills, and combat artes nestled within a series of orbs and webs that you connect from points gained from leveling up in combat. The system offers some element of customization, but since certain areas of the orb need to be unlocked to expand the grid, you tend to be biased toward enhancing the particular stats the game's designers emphasize. There is a small amount of freedom--for example, since Elize can swap between being more physical or magic-oriented during combat, you may try to focus on which one you prefer for her--but most players will find that their parties' skill sets are similar at game's end.   But while so much of Xillia is impressive, there are some questionable design decisions that make the experience less than what it should be, particularly for longtime franchise fans. The most glaring is the dual protagonist system, which sounds like a fantastic idea on paper: you pick one of two main characters at the beginning and get to see the game's major events through that character's eyes, which increases the incentive to come back after you've finished the game to revisit the story from the other character's point of view. Unfortunately, it's handled poorly: since Jude and Milla sometimes partake in completely separate activities, when they reunite, you're stuck hearing an all-too-brief summary of what important events happened to the other person. When you have drastic, story-altering events such as party member recruiting, double-crosses and shocking twists, and character deaths happening offscreen, only to be given a CliffsNotes version after the fact, the plot starts to feel confusing. It's especially bad toward the game's end, when huge things happen for both characters; not seeing the whole story makes the all-important endgame revelations incoherent. It's practically required to play through the game twice if you want to have any idea of what happened. Much like Tales of Graces f, Xillia lacks a world map, though fast travel becomes available fairly early on in the game. Instead, areas are connected by stretches of land filled with roving beasts eager for a taste of your party. The game's structure, however, boasts none of the dungeons and accompanying puzzles, another beloved staple of the series. While the connectedness of the game's major locales makes the world feel more engaging and coherent, the lack of distinct, dangerous locales to solve mysteries in takes some bite out of the exploration element. Most of the puzzle-solving and big-monster-killing is instead relegated to sub-quests in preexisting locations, meaning that you'll see a lot of the same places over and over if you're a completionist. It's a real shame, since the beautiful graphics leave you eager to see what more could be done to make the world come to life.   Other odd changes include new systems for shopping and cooking. The previous Tales release, Tales of Graces f, featured a fun system where you could find materials to upgrade items, transforming weak gear into powerful equipment, and it made you carefully consider your options before buying and selling old stuff. Tales of Xillia feels like a step back in this regard; all of the stores in the game feature the same stock of goods, and you instead contribute supplies and money to help ""upgrade"" the shops so they will carry new stuff and offer discounts. Besides not making much economic sense, it strips away a fun element of visiting RPG locales: seeing what new and unique goods each town has to offer. In addition, the traditional cooking system where you learn recipes and use ingredients for combat-enhancing boosts has been replaced with buying premade dishes, of which you can hold only one of at a time. It's a strange change that reduces the enjoyment and effectiveness of a long-established series element. Tales of Xillia is certainly a solid game, but it feels like it could have been better. The visuals are fantastic, the combat is great, and the characters are wonderful, but the lacking story presentation and exploration elements drag down what could have been one of the best JRPGs on the PlayStation 3. Tales of Xillia 2 has already been announced for an English release, so there is hope that the sequel will fix this game's issues, but for the time being, we have the original game in all of its fun-but-flawed existence."
1164,FlatOut 4: Total Insanity,5.0,1,"Of the four main modes, Flatout is by far the best, offering a series of challenges combining race, survivor and stunt events. It’s the mode that makes the most sense as it’s the easiest to get into, serving up a varied mix of race types, from standard races to the weaponised assault races, as well as different stunts and time trials. The cars are picked out for you, and the collective points you earn from each event tally up to unlock new ones. If only the same sense of urgency in getting you amongst the action existed in the other modes.The career attempts to add some depth in the form of car purchases and upgrades, but the rewards it doles out for winning races versus taking down opponents is diametrically opposed, making progressing through each championship feel like a hefty grind. Points from wins unlock more races while cash, of which you earn a small amount for winning but a much larger amount for taking down opponent’s mid-race, lets you buy better cars to race with. Often, especially early on, I felt like I was forced to make a choice between going for wins or takedowns; compromising between cash for new cars or points for new races, which is a weird choice to have to make. Rewards do get slightly better as you progress, but getting there is a slog.The only way to unlock new cars is by winning consecutive gold cups, which is excessively demanding for a game that already asks a lot of you. Cars aren’t just locked for career mode either, but most of the tracks and cars in quickplay are also inexplicably locked, with no indication as to how to change that. During the career, had the early game rewards and unlocks been more lenient, a new car or two could’ve spiced things up, at least for a few races. But thanks to the repetitive nature of the tracks, frugal rewards just add to the grinding nature of the game.At least when you jump online into Flatout 4’s multiplayer, you get access to every car and track, giving you an opportunity to test out the differences in each. Vehicle handling varies considerably, to the point where, if you play the game long enough, you’ll want to exploit a different car for each track. Online multiplayer is fun in the right company, but some glaring omissions make it hard to come back to. The lack of bots to fill out empty spaces means, unless you have at least three other friends with Flatout 4, it might make for a pretty lonely experience. Public lobbies exist, but they have been practically empty since release day.Visually, Flatout 4 impresses but doesn’t dazzle. God rays poke down through the trees while sparks scatter brightly as cars rub and scrape, and there is no shortage of trackside details to smash through. It aims to hit 30 frames per second, but at least does so consistently, only dipping at the very start of a race when all the cars are bouncing off each other and exaggerated track particles are flung back into your face.Flatout 4 doesn’t bring anything noteworthy to the series, and while the Flatout and party modes are good for some low stakes enjoyment, the grind of single-player progression is too much to bare. The challenge is borderline unfair at times, and that wrecks the partytime nature that the series used to do so well."
1234,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,8.0,2,"In Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, the ease of traveling to space is as simple as pulling out of the driveway. This moment, in all its science-fictionalized spectacle, is emblematic of the rest of the campaign. The game's indelible cast has little time to be impressed with advanced technologies; they’re too busy fighting an intergalactic war. This story is Infinite Warfare's showpiece--a rare, finely constructed Call of Duty tale that manages to outshine its multiplayer counterparts, including a highly involving Zombies cooperative mode.Infinite Warfare's campaign kicks off with a classic sci-fi trope: Earth's dwindling resources motivates and drives humanity to colonize other worlds, but colonization and time give rise to an off-world insurgency. The version of this group in Infinite Warfare--dubbed the Settlement Defense Front--takes an aggressive approach, restricting the earthbound forces' resources with blockades while also racing them to colonize new moons and planets. When you take the controls as protagonist Nick Reyes, you promptly experience the savagery of the SDF firsthand. After the initial dust settles, Reyes undergoes a trial by fire when he's suddenly promoted and given command of his own ship, both while continuing to repel the SDF threat.These events reveal Reyes as a vulnerable leader, one who is prone to moments of apprehension or regret. The campaign only lasts five to seven hours, but Infinite Warfare's writers manage to craft meaningful characters with depth that rivals any from the Modern Warfare series. There's Nora Salter, Reyes' dependable ally who, up until recently, was the same rank as Reyes. Another example is chief engineer Audrey MaCallum, who appears for only a few minutes but manages to make the most of her limited screen time. As an ex-captain, she shares her poignant backstory, explaining how she gave up her commission by committing the mortal sin of caring for her crew. Caring and sacrifice are overarching themes that play into this story's key moments.This sci-fi tale doesn't have any aliens, but its standout character isn't human. ETH.3n (pronounced Ethan), a robotic naval petty officer, represents a new definition of a perfect military warrior: a strong, dependable teammate who can also soften a tense moment. He proves handy in every firefight, but his greatest gift is his wit. He jokes about having a farmer's brain and makes light of the rivalry between the Navy and Marines. At his best, he sounds uncannily human.Ethan is also your co-pilot and introduces you to Infinite Warfare’s exquisite spacecraft combat. Dubbed the Jackals, the game's highly maneuverable ships cast a silhouette reminiscent of an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. It's a thrill to chase targets through tight gaps and around columns. The most intense moments occur when enemies match your level of agility and aggression, forcing you to try to shake them off with sharp turns and salvos of diversionary flares. Call of Duty games have always had vehicles, but it's hard to recall one as involving and unforgettable as Infinite Warfare's.Many military-shooter campaigns are designed with a persistent--sometimes forced--sense of urgency. There's more nuance to Infinite Warfare's flow, where the pressure of an ongoing war maintains the sensation of forward momentum without feeling rushed. Moreover, its writers are wise to avoid the restrictive structure of chapter breaks. While this campaign features clearly defined missions at distinct planetary destinations, the story plays out more like a long film than a 13-episode cable series. One key ingredient to this cohesion and the narrative's invisible pull to press forward is minimal presence of loading screens. This benefit is accentuated in missions where you seamlessly transition from the Jackal to zero-G combat to on-foot shootouts.Infinite Warfare does not shy away from the cruel indifference of space. I winced at the effectiveness of sending a dozen foes into the vacuum by simply destroying a large nearby window or grappled myself to a string of enemies, cycling through the five or so fatal takedown animations (e.g. cracking the glass of their helmets, activating their grenades before kicking them away). Any momentary sense of guilt was forgotten when I remembered the SDF’s unforgivable actions during the story’s initial hour.There's more nuance to Infinite Warfare's flow, where the pressure of an ongoing war maintains the sensation of forward momentum without feeling rushed.The campaign's side missions, while skippable, elevate the overall experience of the single-player mode. Some of these sorties feature the campaign's most memorable assignments, such as an assassination plot where you're disguising yourself as an SDF soldier. The mission partners Reyes with Salter, and the appeal is as much about his banter with the lieutenant as it is about a satisfying opportunity to eliminate some high-level SDF officials. This optional section of the campaign also lets you log additional flight time since half the missions are Jackal operations. Given the limited opportunities to pilot the ship in the main missions, it's a joy to partake in additional dogfights and find ways to sink destroyers, often single-handedly.The profoundly hostile nature of space is, unfortunately, not something that can be found in multiplayer. It’s disappointing to miss out on the thrill of zero-G combat in a competitive online environment, especially when games like Star Wars Battlefront and Strike Vector affirm its appeal. What you have instead are the usual tournament-ready modes, a familiar playlist of match types that take no chances on new ideas. Defender is Infinite Warfare's version of Halo's keep-away game, Oddball, where it's often more stimulating to defend the ball carrier than be the ball carrier. And Kill Confirmed once again proves its worth as an alternative to team deathmatch – you must run to the spot where your target was killed and grab their dog tag for your kill to count, giving nearby enemies an equal opportunity to beat you to that dog tag--or worse, kill you and steal your tag as well. The result? Tense micro tug-of-wars that you can't find in classic team deathmatch.The new online battlegrounds are, unsurprisingly, inspired by environments found in the single-player mode but include a few exclusive locales, like a small Japanese urban center. Much like prior Call of Duty competitive maps, it only takes a few sessions to get the lay of the land, discern the best sniping spots, and discover high-traffic areas. Even the wall-running points are easy to commit to memory. As with the last two Call of Dutys, using walls can give you an edge in avoiding gunfire and catching ground enemies off guard. There's elegance in the simplicity of the maps, although they lack imaginative design, partly due to an overabundance of right angles.Multiplayer's mid-match and profile progression rely on a classic reward loop that recognizes skill--and the devotion to play matches for hours on end. That includes the return of the UAV, an assault drone that can wreak havoc and rack up substantial kills during a single flyby. Two new notable unlocks, depending on which class you select, are the Eraser--a gun that vaporizes its target instantly--and the Claw, which fires a horizontal rain of ricocheting bullets. These enhancements are welcome bonuses that add variety to the matches and are even useful in the hands of novice players eager to increase their kill count.Tied to these bonuses are the Rigs, Infinite Warfare's multiplayer classes. Rigs expands on the traditional FPS class archetypes where Stryker serves as the Support class while Phantom is the Scout. Warfighter mirrors the Assault class and it's supported in the frontlines with the high-tech FTL class and the Synaptic robot experienced in close quarters combat. Collectively, these class variants do not add anything substantially new to the matches though they're each worth checking out, even if their roles might fall outside your comfort zone.Zombies is an amusing contrast to Infinite Warfare's campaign in that this cooperative multiplayer mode is once again bereft of subtlety. It's a caricature of the 1980s, down to the neon-heavy art direction and a rapper in a tracksuit as one of the playable characters. The map and backdrop to these visuals is 'Spaceland,' a futuristically-styled theme park. It is the first of a number of planned Zombies maps for Infinite Warfare, designed as movie settings by a fictional film director named Willard Wyler. In keeping with the '80s motif, Wyler’s voiced by Paul Reubens (best known as Pee-wee Herman), whose sinister voice channels a hint of Vincent Price.What this mode lacks in aesthetic nuance, it makes up for in strategic depth. Zombies presents a risk-versus-reward scenario where opening up additional sections of Spaceland as soon as possible may not always be the best strategy. New areas contain new gear and zombie traps, but you increase the amount of enemy spawn points and the risk of getting separated from your team. A common benefit to opening up new sections? The attractions that can quash zombies in high numbers, like an arcade with a lethal laser dance floor. There's a positive sense of trial-and-error when figuring out what park-expansion progression works for you and you friends.By venturing beyond Earth--and not just to other planets, but to space itself--Call of Duty found a canvas to produce its best story in years. It reinforces the notion that a game's narrative is only as good as its characters. Given the campaign's accomplishments in space combat, it's puzzling that no effort was made to replicate its zero-G sensations in Infinite Warfare's multiplayer. Consequently, the well-crafted Zombies mode is a more attractive, time-consuming proposition for those looking to play with friends. While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday."
4747,Evasive Space,3.0,0,"  When a game features a hero named Konki the Stellar Guardian and a bad guy called Dr. Dark Matter, the review sort of writes itself. It isn't the absurd childish character names that make Evasive Space an awful slog though; it's the controls. This WiiWare top-down shooter with a twist (there's no shooting) is based on an impressive premise of escaping every nasty situation that enemies throw at you, which gives the game an addictive puzzle vibe. Unfortunately, the game is also based on the not-so-impressive premise of using the Wii Remote to guide your every movement, which is just about as enjoyable and as painful as slamming a car door on your hand. Repeatedly.        Only the concept here is sound. The idea behind Evasive Space is good enough that the game would probably have gulped down a lot of quarters if it had hit arcades around the same time that Foreigner hit the top 10. You take command of Konki the Stellar Guardian's 2D spaceship and maneuver it through a series of levels to gather up all of the Constellation Stones that have been swiped by the insidious Dr. Dark Matter and his gang of space thieves. Yes, this is a deeply dumb plot that you will ignore whether you're playing the 20 missions of the solo campaign or the local multiplayer where you take on up to three other players in one-off races and timed challenges.     Of much more importance is the game design, which veers away from top-down arcade fare, such as old classics like Asteroids and modern equivalents like Geometry Wars, and ditches shooting completely. Instead of blasting baddies to bits, you evade obstacles. The focus here is on staying away from the many level hazards and grabbing power-ups like time bonuses and diodes that power ship upgrades, such as on-demand shields. Primary level objectives include races through maze-like corridors to hit warp gates before they close and scavenger hunts where you scoop up set numbers of floating astronauts or energy power-ups. Everything is intense and frenzied even without any firepower, due to tight time limits. You often have less than a minute to get out of Dodge, so every mistake where you run into a wall or turn the wrong way can be very costly.        What could also be costly is the strain that the Evasive Space controls put on your wrist. After a few hours of play you might have to sign yourself up for carpal tunnel surgery. You guide Konki's ship by moving a cursor with the remote and pressing the B button to engage engine thrust. All you need to do is aim the cursor where you want to fly and hit a button to get there. Simple and intuitive. And also extraordinarily frustrating and painful. Everything is unforgiving, and the ship controls are temperamental. It seems like the hunk of junk never wants to head directly for the cursor, so you wind up looping around power-ups and backtracking to pick up objects that you somehow sailed right past.     Evasive Space is a good-looking game, but it is far too busy. You can easily lose track of the cursor behind the interface or mistake it for space debris like asteroids or nebulas. Corridors are so narrow and levels so clogged with obstacles that you have to be just about perfect to get out of a level. A split second of confusion is enough to cause you to spin off the screen to your doom or plow into a wall, so expect to get stuck in some levels for more than an hour. Worst of all, the difficulty and control fussiness cause you to grip the remote so tightly that you can barely unclench your hand at the end of a level.     If Evasive Space were just another run-of-the-mill arcade game played with a gamepad, it would come close to being an enjoyable enough experience to justify the 1,000 Wii Points asking price. Unfortunately, the motion-sensing controls have turned this promising design into a wrist-cracking trip into hand cramp hell.    "
655,Wolfenstein: Youngblood,7.0,2,"From front to back, Wolfenstein: Youngblood is very much the same game on the Nintendo Switch as it is on other consoles and PC. You'll get the bombastic combat scenarios where you'll tear through Nazi trash as the charismatic, dynamic duo of Jess and Soph Blazkowicz, twin daughters of series hero BJ Blazkowicz. And you have the opportunity to play it all alongside a friend. The portable nature of the Nintendo Switch makes this an even more enticing prospect, but the platform's limited hardware hurts the game's best parts; low frame rates and muddy visuals make the action harder to enjoy. While these issues are not prohibitive, they do make the Switch version the weakest of the bunch.Youngblood is a bite-sized spin-off that jumps ahead in Wolfenstein's timeline by taking you to the 1980s, almost 20 years after the events of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. You see an older Anya and BJ teaching their twin daughters Jess and Soph the means of survival, just before BJ goes missing. With the help of Abby, daughter of Grace Walker from The New Colossus, you're able to track him down in Nazi-occupied France, particularly Neu-Paris.Not long after the introductory mission do you see how Youngblood breaks off from the traditional Wolfenstein structure; Neu-Paris acts as a group of separate hub areas where most of the action takes place. Many of the side quests and random events in these areas feel more like filler and will eventually have you running through familiar areas frequently. If anything, it's at least a means of familiarizing yourself with the intricacies of the Dishonored-influenced districts. Main missions branch off from the hub areas, and in these missions are where you'll find the relentless, challenging firefights that keep up a satisfying momentum. This is where Youngblood truly shines on the PC version, however, due to the Switch's technical limitations, it doesn't quite hit the same highs. [Read our PC review for our full thoughts.]Overall, technical performance hampers some of the great FPS action as it makes aiming, movement, and reacting a bit more difficult.Light RPG elements are new to the Wolfenstein franchise, and they don't shake up the formula too much, but make for some enjoyable twists. You'll earn XP and level up to drop points into a skill tree that grants new abilities or buffs to make you more effective in combat. You can upgrade weapons to fire with even more impact or change the way they function altogether. There's also an armor-type element to strong enemies that'll have you juggling between certain weapons to lay down the most damage. All these small changes serve to bring a slightly more dynamic edge to a solid FPS foundation.Youngblood is wrapped in the idea of cooperative play, which is a blast. Friends (or randoms) can jump into your session easily and the game-state will remain untouched--the AI simply gets taken over by the player, and vice-versa when they leave. Pep signals are core to the co-op experience; these are cooldowns that grant useful buffs or clutch armor/health recharges. The revive system is another key to teamwork that sort of comes in place of traditional checkpoints. Outside of pep signals though, there feels like a lack of synergetic co-op gameplay features, like tag-team attacks or teamwork-centric capabilities, and it feels like a missed opportunity. It's worth noting that you will need to have a Nintendo Switch Online account to do any sort of co-op play, however.When it comes to the Switch version specifically, the question on many minds is: how well does it run? To that, I would say: not great. The frame rate is the most noticeable shortcoming as the game generally runs at sub-30 FPS and chugs when the action gets intense in both docked and undocked modes. There's also heavy use of motion blur to help smooth over the low frame rate. Overall, technical performance hampers some of the great FPS action as it makes aiming, movement, and reacting a bit more difficult. While not as important, the downgrade in visual quality is readily apparent. The game runs at 540p handheld and 720p docked, but uses some sort of dynamic resolution for assets and character models to help keep the frame rate in check. This turns things into blocky messes in certain combat scenarios that take place in large environments. And the low resolution and a gray foggy haze slightly obscures objects and enemies in the distance, making them difficult to identify. Youngblood suffers as a result of the Switch's relatively underpowered hardware, but for all its technical shortcomings, the game still delivers intense, momentous, and challenging combat. Everything features-wise remains intact, and you'll get to enjoy taking a shotgun (or fully charged laser beam) to the heads of Nazi scum. The Blazkowicz sisters, Jess and Soph, bring their own unique swagger to the Wolfenstein franchise, too. So if the Switch version is your only way of playing Youngblood, you can be confident it's still one hell of a ride."
2637,TERA,8.0,2,"     So what is it about the combat that makes it so good? For one, you needn't worry about choosing your target before firing off the usual barrage of sword slashes and fireballs that automatically find their mark. Instead, you hover your targeting reticle over your target and swing, or stab, or cast. Sure, some attacks are homing attacks, but generally, if you miss, you don't do any damage. For example, should you release a slow-moving blastball and the big hulk in front of you lumbers away, you're out of luck. Tera feels more like a third-person action game than most MMOGs--you don't even need to hold a mouse button to engage mouselook.      As a result, you feel connected to the action: your key presses and mouse maneuvers translate almost immediately to the screen. Yes, there are ability cooldowns, and you have to wait for animations to complete. But there is a sense of agility to the combat that's rare in the genre. Big creatures bound around and exhale toxic fumes, while you and your adventuring party hammer on them when you aren't busy dodging, guarding, and getting into the most effective position. The biggest creatures are known as BAMs (that is, big-ass monsters), and facing one is a rush. One such monster is the ovolith, a giant spider creature that rolls across the landscape like a spinning top, bounds into the air and lands with a smash, and hammers the ground in the same way a data entry expert hammers on a keyboard. Facing one with three or four friends is a riot. You must aim your attacks and stay alert, and you receive an indication of damage done only when your ice blast meets flesh--not before. How wonderful it is, this rare feeling that you are performing daring battlefield feats, rather than simply inputting commands and watching them play out onscreen.       Fallen Earth or Age of Conan levels of excellence, nor will you shape the story as you play in the style of Star Wars: The Old Republic. Yet developer BlueHole Studio tries to sweep you up in the process, punctuating certain story quests with excellent real-time cutscenes featuring your own character. Story arcs often culminate in instanced battles, with you and maybe your teammates fending off a sequence of attackers, or taking on a nasty boss demon. These sequences do a great job of keeping the mundane side quests from wearing on you.        Considering the blandness of the quests, Tera keeps you involved in the proceedings. Of course, much of this has to do with the combat. But the world design can take much of that credit. Granted, there's a certain inconsistency to the Tera universe. You can play as a horned, ferocious-looking Castanic, or as a hypercute foxgirl from the Elin race. The noble flesh mountains known as the Baraka cut impressive figures--particularly when standing next to a Popori, which looks like a portly panda. This bizarre and eclectic mix of fantasy figures comes across as disjointed at first, but it ultimately comes together. That's at least in part because the character diversity is matched by environmental diversity. The tropical landscapes at Cutthroat Harbor couldn't be more different from the enchanted city of Pora Elinu.        And what a place it is. A dark baroque tower rises in the center, the golden light behind stained glass windows acting like beacons, drawing you closer. In the creepy Forsaken Fields, gnarled vines warn you away, as if the sinister vampires in tuxedos and top hats weren't already doing so. Tera is a great-looking game with dozens of distinct regions waiting to be explored. It also runs extremely well, deftly balancing beauty with performance. In fact, from top to bottom, Tera performs wonderfully. It isn't bug-free: there are some quest glitches and occasional spots of lag, and the chat window has a bad habit of deleting chat logs. But Tera is yet another signal to other massively multiplayer online game developers that it isn't OK to release a hobbled game suffering from major bugs and wide content gaps.        Not that Tera is fully loaded where content is concerned. There are plenty of quests to perform (you never grind for grinding's sake), but if you seek player-versus-player excitement, you'll want to sit this one out. There are the usual one-on-one duels, as well as team-versus-team deathmatches that function much like duels do, albeit with two teams rather than two players. Deathmatches require two willing groups; they don't take place in structured battle arenas, and there is no matchmaking, and thus no one ever plays deathmatch. If you like to deliver cruel open-world savageness to unsuspecting travelers, you can choose a PVP server, where you may also take part in guild-on-guild battles. But a more structured battlefield is sorely needed for players on all servers. The good news is that battlegrounds are planned for later this year. For now, however, it does feel as though something's missing, considering most modern MMOGs offer an easy way to fight other players without worrying that some high-level executioner is ready to intrude on your questing.      If you're in it for the camaraderie, however, Tera is for you. Group dungeons are a lot of fun. In Sinestral's manor, for example, crimson horned behemoths stand in your way, but with a talented party, you should make it past them unscathed. The final clawed horror might give you a hard time of it though, as it madly marches forward and twirls about in anger. Again, it all comes down to the combat: you can't rely on targeting these meanies and firing a bunch of arrows with abandon. You have to know how to time your swings, be ready to block or dodge, and cast the lengthiest spells only when you know you've got the time to spare. (Nothing is more disheartening than having a creature jump out of the effective area of your spell.) No matter which group role you prefer, there's a class you'll enjoy. Ranged magic, hardy tanks, healers, support classes--it's all covered, and even better, all classes are available to all races.       Once you get a handle on which attacks serve you best, you can further customize skills using glyphs. Tera doesn't have a traditional talent tree. Instead, you purchase glyphs and use them to enhance your existing skills. But you have limited glyph points, and certain glyphs cost more points than others, so you must choose which glyphs you want to equip. You can also enhance weapons by slotting in crystals, and even enchant them. And there are also typical gathering and crafting systems that allow you to collect raw materials and assemble them into better gear. The player economy is active, so whether you prefer to make and sell a fancy magical disc or are in the market for one, the player trade brokerage is a valuable tool.      Other features reveal their nature as greater numbers of players gain levels, such as a political system in which guild leaders campaign to lead a province. Otherwise, Tera has an air of the expected. Structurally, it's not much different from any other online fantasy RPG: you level up and move on to new areas, completing quests until you're ready for the next. What a difference an excellent combat system makes, and in Tera's case, it elevates an ordinary game into something more delightful than you would have expected from an MMOG. It might be all about the fight, but when the fight is this much fun, you want to keep your axe arm swinging and your mouse finger clicking.    "
2665,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings,9.0,2,"     You may have heard about the stupendous visuals of The Witcher 2 on the PC, and probably wonder: how does the Xbox 360 version compare? It should be no surprise that the console release can't match its higher-resolution PC counterpart, which was a standard-setter on that platform. Shadows are less extensive, the draw distance isn't quite as astonishing, and some texture pop-in, jittery transitions, and longer loading times will stand out to anyone who has seen the game running at the highest settings on the PC.       Welcome to the world of The Witcher 2, which is alive with activity yet tinged with violence and sorrow. The opening moments ready you for the game's brutal overtones, showing a captive Geralt of Rivia whipped and taunted by his jailers. Geralt's defaced flesh is a horrific sight, but thematically relevant: he is scarred by his past. Once thought dead, he is still piecing together memories of a savage battle and a beauty called Yennefer. The story takes its cue from these lost memories, juxtaposing sex and brutailty. It also presents both as inevitable and natural results of the mortal condition. You can bed various women in The Witcher 2; ploughing (that is, sex) is a frequent subject of conversation, and one of Geralt's favorite pastimes.      lone wolf.   The Witcher on PC, don't worry that you'll feel lost: the prologue does an excellent job of catching you up on what you need to know. Nor do you need to wonder about the assassin's identity; it doesn't remain a secret for long, and it's quickly clear that The Witcher 2 is no murder mystery.     Instead, The Witcher 2 is a chronicle of discovery, redemption, and political upheaval. Geralt is blamed for Foltest's murder, but as he gets closer to the true killer, he becomes more and more involved in the region's power struggles. Those assisting Geralt on his quest include the flamboyant bard Dandelion and the earthy Zoltan, a foul-mouthed dwarf who, like most of The Witcher 2's dwarves, loves women and drink. Dwarves are a rich source of humor in most role-playing games, and The Witcher 2's are no exception. Yet, the tone is different here. These are the raunchiest dwarves you've ever encountered, yet the comedy is undercut by underlying anguish.        In fact, a deep undercurrent of pain and suffering flows beneath each character and event. A mother's unspoken agony taints the wonder of childbirth. A father's drive to protect his son may brand him a coward in his own progeny's eyes, but it's a price he's willing to pay, and Geralt isn't one to turn down a bit of coin--or in this case, some pertinent information. Many quests, including those new to this edition, involve the game's signature moral dilemmas. Whom do you believe: a soldier with hygiene problems haunted by a wraith, or the wraith that accuses the soldier of her own murder? Do you absolve a pair of nobles of treason, condemn them, or spare one and sacrifice the other? In this complicated world, there isn't necessarily a right choice. There is no meter to determine whether you are being ""good"" or ""bad,"" and Geralt is neither hero nor villain.      Not including the prologue and epilogue, The Witcher 2 is split into three acts. The first is primarily concerned with following the killer's trail, while the second greatly expands the plot. The convoluted plot seems poised to explode in the final episode, only to fizzle at the end. The lack of closure intimates a sequel, and the final act is abrupt when compared to the robustness of the first two. Nevertheless, there is no reason to feel slighted, as the journey is entertaining and reasonably lengthy, given several hours of additional gameplay over the PC version's initial release. Yet what makes The Witcher 2 most impressive isn't its length or its vastness; it isn't an open-world, content-stuffed game in the way of the Elder Scrolls series. Instead, its triumph is in how your decisions fundamentally transform your journey.       The Witcher 2 is essentially multiple games gracefully molded into a single experience. The second act, for instance, tells a very different tale depending on choices you make beforehand. You might comb beaches and battlefields or go spelunking with a group of profane dwarves at your side, in each case making a different region your base of operations. By their very flexibility, many RPGs inspire replay, but few offer such differing paths, allowing you to experience a complex narrative from distinct points of view. The characters at your side, the enemies you face, the dialogue--they all differ based on a series of decisions that the game never forgets.        Cities and wilderness areas are relatively contained, though just extensive enough to encourage exploration. In doing so, you might uncover a chest that can be opened only by interpreting the clues on a nearby scroll, or stumble upon a giant arachnid guarding treasure. A number of stupendous action moments punctuate your travels. You won't remember just the big story developments, but the sequences in which you clutch your sword and stare down the danger ahead with savage resolve. In one such scenario, you slash away at grotesque representations of hate and violence, the whispers of magical incantations barely rising above the distant noise of steel on steel. Elsewhere, terrifying screams and flurries of feathers make your first encounter with a gaggle of harpies unforgettable, and the squawks and growls of unseen wildlife intensify your showdown with an endrega queen.     While there are a few different kinds of weapons you might wield, you usually choose between your silver and steel swords, depending on whether you are facing monsters or humans. You perform both light and heavy attacks from a third-person view, and can block and cast signs (Geralt's magic spells) as well. Before you leap into the prologue, you might want to check out the tutorial, though it isn't strictly necessary, as the first proper combat encounter isn't nearly as punishing as it was on the PC. It might take you a few tries, but you eventually grasp the rhythm of swordplay. Crowd control is important: you want to avoid getting surrounded at all costs, and bombs and traps can make all the difference when the odds look overwhelming.      The Xbox 360 release benefits from a reasonable difficulty curve, but there are some frustrations here and there. The manual targeting system is fiddly enough that you'll likely let the game's auto-targeting take over for you, unless you face a single enemy, or maybe two. You might inadvertently tumble toward an enemy behind the one you meant to attack and find yourself in the center of a deadly mob. There are also moments when basic actions don't feel as responsive as they should; unsheathing your sword might take a couple of button presses, for instance. Yet the action is largely satisfying and enjoyable. There's a palpable sense of weight in every swing. Geralt might somersault toward his victim and slash him with a steel sword or use a flaming staff pilfered from a succubus to land slower, heavier blows.        Potions are toxic to Geralt; thus, the number you can drink is limited. It might take you a while to come to terms with this ""prepare in advance"" approach to potions. Brews act as statistic buffs rather than immediate cure-alls, and unless you know what monsters you might be coming up against, you don't necessarily know which potions are most effective. When the story snatches you up into a series of battles and cutscenes, you may never be allowed to meditate and, thus, never reap the benefits potions may have granted. Thankfully, the long animations depicting Geralt entering and exiting his meditation pose have been removed, making this process less arduous.      It may also take some time to get used to the interface. It isn't complex but there are some minor idiosyncrasies, some of which are rather sensible. You can't hold a button to identify loot and items of interest as you can in other RPGs; instead, you activate Geralt's medallion. It's a neat way of taking a game-y function and making it seem more natural. Other interface quirks are less understandable. In most RPGs, once you exhaust a particular dialogue tree, you are usually allowed to select other options before exiting the interaction. In The Witcher 2, you might get thrown out of the conversation and have to reengage the character to explore other options. It would have been nice to compare equipment at a glance, rather than have to select a particular menu option. There are other quirks too, such as picky contextual prompts (you might disarm a trap instead of swinging at an attacking nekker), but they are small blemishes on this ambitious adventure.        Though combat is central to The Witcher 2, it's far from the only thing you do as Geralt. You can earn some coin by trading blows with certain locals, which means performing a relatively easy sequence of quick-time button presses. Timed events show up in boss fights and in other scripted sequences as well, though the game doesn't focus on them, and they make for a fun spectacle: the close camera angles and barbaric punches give brawls a lot of pizzazz. The PC version's arm-wrestling minigame returns as well and controls far better with a controller than it did with a mouse and keyboard. You can even go get a haircut or play some dice when you aren't busy chatting up the local ladies or hearing of Zoltan's latest exploits.     The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings - Enhanced Edition is an excellent port of a superb game, embracing many of the elements we love about RPGs without skimping on any of them. But it's the way it handles player choice in particular that makes it most notable. There are no contrived right-versus-wrong decisions to exploit. The results of your decision don't just influence minor details: they lead you down wildly disparate paths, each as entertaining as the others. The Witcher 2 is a mature game indeed--not just because of its sexual themes and violent images, but because of its complex portrayal of morally ambiguous individuals struggling in a morally ambiguous world.     "
2587,ORC: Vengeance,8.0,2,"   Diablo or Torchlight, the story plays a minor role. Ultimately, it’s merely there to serve as the most basic of motivations for the bloodletting to come.     Each large area is broken up into bite-sized chunks, with an intuitive tap-to-move control scheme guiding Rok around the environments. Holding your finger briefly on the screen, meanwhile, has him break into a gentle jog if you’re in more of a hurry to get somewhere. There’s plenty of loot to collect and basic puzzles to solve as you explore the cavernous crypts and rain-lashed battlements of this ruined city, but the focus is firmly on combat.      Fortunately, the action very satisfying, with a terrific sense of weight. Rok's movements might be slow, but you sense the sinews straining as he winds his arms back before bringing his mace down on an enemy's skull. Defeating basic grunts is simply a case of tapping on them and waiting until they die, though soon you find yourself overwhelmed by sheer numbers. At that point you need to use simple gestures--double-taps, circles, and zigzag lines--to pull off area attacks and dash charges, to roll out of harm's way when surrounded, or to glug a potion that will refill your armour or health bar. Special moves deplete a vengeance meter, which slowly regenerates during normal combat or can be instantly topped up with another potion. You’ll need to choose your moves carefully: only four of these vengeance skills can be equipped at once, and each of them can be levelled up for a small fee.       Fortunately, you're rarely short of money. Coins are in plentiful supply, dropped by enemies or contained within smashable pots or chests that Rok uncouthly opens with a satisfyingly aggressive kick. Any items you collect can be sold to a vendor at the end of each stage. In a smart piece of design, any duplicates are instantly converted to gold. You can, of course, spend real-world cash on a boost to Rok's account: though the more expensive items make the difficulty curve a little smoother, you can only upgrade weapons to Rok's own level, so it never feels unbalanced.     Given the range of pauldrons and vambraces found in other dungeon-crawlers it's disappointing that loot is restricted to weapons and shields. At least there are a pleasing variety of both, with swords, daggers, maces, and axes to choose from, each offering different benefits and buffs. There’s something inherently satisfying about finding an item that’s just a little better than the one you currently own, and once you’re caught inside that addictive loot loop, you’ll find it difficult to wriggle free.     As enjoyable as it is, the moment-to-moment combat doesn't change a great deal, though after slugging it out toe-to-toe in the early stages you’ll find you need to back off increasingly frequently, with undead enemies that can deplete your armour in a couple of hefty hits, and wraiths that drain your health alarmingly quickly. There's a different tempo to the boss encounters, but even there the rhythm finds itself repeating eventually. It's a less noticeable issue if the game is played in short bursts, as clearly intended: stages are broken up into chapters that neither feel too stingy, nor outstay their welcome.       Besides, Argon and its inhabitants provide another compelling reason to continue. The world represents an austere slice of Tolkienesque fantasy, with a distinct lack of natural light: the brightest it gets is when rain-swept castle battlements are briefly illuminated by flashes of lightning. Outside it's almost constantly raining, while inside you plough through dimly lit environs gated off by crumbling masonry and burning objects. It sounds unpleasant, but there's a bleak beauty to it all. A bombastic orchestral soundtrack, meanwhile, provides fitting aural accompaniment for the grunts, thumps, and splats of the game's meaty skirmishes.     In some respects, Orc: Vengeance is a fairly generic dungeon crawler, but don't let that blind you to its achievements. Its controls, interface, and audiovisual qualities are exemplary, while its use of in-app purchases is pleasingly unobtrusive and sensibly balanced. This is a textbook example of how core games needn’t be compromised by a smartphone interface, and an entertaining journey through a delightfully brutal world.  "
2057,The LEGO Movie Videogame,7.0,2,"  Lego City Undercover on the Wii U, or even Lego The Lord of the Rings. That's disappointing to find after previous games did such a good job of dropping you into a pleasingly expansive world, but the positive side to that coin is the general lack of dead weight. Here, you are asked to wander a great deal less, and though a handful of optional tasks are offered in each zone, narrative momentum is the obvious priority. Some basic ingenuity allows you to advance to the next set piece with minimal difficulty. As for the story, it's the same as the one shown in theaters. Emmet, the protagonist, is a forgettable construction worker who finds his whitewashed view of the world made more colorful by a chance encounter with Wyldstyle, a free-spirited adventurer who is convinced Emmet holds the key to saving the world from an evil menace. The movie had a lot of fun with its clever references to pop culture, and the game does too in the most direct manner possible: by including huge chunks of footage from the film. Except for two pivotal scenes that unfold near the end of the movie but are glossed over or cut here--to no ill effect--and occasional moments of incidental dialogue, nearly everything makes an appearance. The central themes are just slightly less apparent, but you still get a cohesive and lively story from start to finish, complete with the best scenes from the most memorable Lego characters. Many scenes from the movie lend themselves naturally to a game experience, and that quickly becomes evident here. An introductory stage acquaints you with the basics by walking you through Emmet's rather mundane day at the construction site. Before long, though, he's driving a motorcycle along a crowded freeway, and Wyldstyle is making her way along the tops of moving vehicles. These events are almost wholly participatory, making it all feel even more frantic than in the film. Then in a later sequence, the characters flee along the rooftops and battle robots along the way--another pivotal scene at the cinema. Here, it's just fleshed out a bit more, and there are puzzles to solve. So it goes with much of the game, all without the mix ever feeling unnatural or forced. Visuals during the levels and in the cutscenes complement one another beautifully and are perpetually bright and shiny in all the right places. Although The Lego Movie has delighted audiences of all ages with its clever writing and inside jokes, the video game version isn't as universally absorbing. Puzzles are simple enough that children should be able to solve them just through experimenting, but too many of them take a paint-by-numbers approach. You simply search for an obvious piece of the architecture that Emmet can drill, break everything apart until you find glowing points of interest that can be assembled, or look for a point on a distant ledge to grapple. Throw in some mild brawling elements--with no fear of failure, aside from a lower rating upon completion of the stage--and you have the bulk of the game. It can wear thin at times, but that's not a new problem for the franchise. Elsewhere, more minor concerns also pop up on occasion. Infrequently, it's possible to get a character stuck on the architecture, unable to move. If you're playing alone you can easily switch to another character in the party, though, and then break apart your trapped friend. If you're playing cooperatively the second player can do the same, so at least there's an easy workaround when necessary. In other cases, you may find yourself controlling a flying character who stops short at arbitrary barriers quite a lot, even though it looks like he should be able to keep flying. None of the issues are persistent enough to serve as a huge inconvenience, but they do warrant a mention. The Lego Movie Videogame is a faithful take on its source material, with just enough of the film's content missing to make it worth getting out to the theater, but not so much that the game's narrative becomes difficult to follow. The added interaction is also welcome and is handled in a manner that keeps the experience approachable and generally refined, even if it isn't always as creative and varied as you might hope. While not everything is awesome, The Lego Movie Videogame should be just the ticket if you're ready to spend another 10 to 12 hours in the fantastic world of animated plastic blocks."
2380,Time and Eternity,4.0,0,"      Even as the plot setup and central cast are being introduced, Time and Eternity seems determined to make you dislike it. Zack, the male hero--and the character whose perspective you follow--seems more interested in off-color thoughts and remarks and being ""manly"" than he is in Toki and Towa's genuine affection and well-being. Toki and Towa are affectionate toward Zack in a way that feels very uncomfortable at times, given Zack's questionable behavior. Toki's friends are one-note anime archetypes (ditzy wedding planner, shrill rich girl who flaunts her status, and boy-crazy teenager) who offer no real character development and simply exist to set up bad jokes. Non-player characters you meet over the course of the story are similarly irritating, typically featuring a single humorous (read: obnoxious) trait that defines their entire personality. It's hard to be invested in anyone's plight when almost every player in the story is unlikable. Though that's not to imply that the story is good; Time and Eternity features some of the most insipid plot twists you could possibly conceive for the time-travel concept.         Just a few minutes later, you start to become keenly aware of constant animation sequence recycling. Reused and repeating animation is certainly nothing new in games, but the jerky, awkward motions of the characters and inconsistent frame rates make the rampant reuse both more noticeable and more unappealing. (As an example, you can play an impromptu metagame just counting how many times Toki and Towa do their weird leg-crossing/uncrossing animation during the teatime sequences.)     The cheap feel of the animation becomes even more pronounced when you see just how much palette-swapping goes on throughout the game. Toki and Towa share the bulk of their animations, but are simply colored differently, leading to motions that don't match the personality of the character in play. In addition, there are only a handful of enemy designs, but plenty of palette swaps for each one. But perhaps the worst visual effect comes from the juxtaposition of 2D animated models against the game's 3D backgrounds, leading to awkward camera angles, weird scene transitions, and disjointed character movements. (The backgrounds, lacking in detail as they may be, at least offer some pleasant use of color, which is probably the nicest thing you can say about the visuals.)          Combat is a bit more interesting…at first. You control a single character--either Toki or Towa--in real time, fighting one-on-one against foes. There are two positions in combat, long range and close range, and the techniques available at each range are different. Ranges offer distinct advantages: it's easier to dodge attacks at long range, while close range allows you to shatter the enemy's defense. You can swap between ranges at will (unless the enemy has you cornered at close range), as well as guard to reduce damage from enemy attacks or sidestep to try to avoid them entirely.       This sounds like it could work well, but it falls apart in practice. The one-on-one format strips party-synergy strategy from combat, leaving it feeling very shallow. (Drake sometimes performs attacks and recovery skills, though these are out of your control.) The animation of Toki makes the controls feel awkward and disjointed, as though her movements suffer from constant input lag. Trying to attack and dodge with Toki and Towa is something like playing an old LaserDisc game, just with fewer onscreen button prompts. What initially seems like novel combat degenerates into a repetitive series of simple pattern memorization.       Encountering strings of enemies one after the other makes battles even more aggravating--it's frustrating to smack down one palette-swapped bird only to fight another one (and another one) immediately afterward. To top it off, you can't manually change control between Toki and Towa at will. The two characters have somewhat different skill sets, making one more advantageous in certain battles, but they trade off only when a certain item is used or when you level up. This has the effect of suddenly leaving you with a character who doesn't fight as well against the enemies in an area because you made the mistake of gaining a level.     It's hard to find much positive to say about Time and Eternity. Its sole points of excellence are some nice illustrations and its superb soundtrack, featuring songs from Yuzo Koshiro (ActRaiser, Streets of Rage, and Etrian Odyssey), but everything else is an ill-conceived mess executed poorly. If you want to experience a beautiful anime-style role-playing game, you have many other choices, like the recent Ni no Kuni. It's best to leave Time and Eternity on the store shelves forevermore.   "
2015,SMITE,8.0,2,"       League of Legends; in Conquest mode, your goal is to destroy the enemy's towers to make a path to its minotaur. You choose any or all of the three lanes to push your army of minions into the enemy's base. Your god levels up over the course of the battle, gaining access to his or her full array of skills, which help to battle the enemy's team of gods. You earn gold for being near minions as they die, and a bonus is granted for delivering the killing blow. There is no ability to deny your own minions as in Dota 2, but forcing enemy gods away from the clashing minions starves them of their gold income. Gold is spent on items, and many of the items bear striking similarities to the items from other MOBAs. But if it ain't broke...  The difference is in the delivery, and thanks to Smite's WASD controls as opposed to the more real-time strategy feel of other MOBAs, items are free to have effects, such as allowing you to attack while on the move without slowing down. Playing a marksman yields a more visceral experience as you kite back without relying on either AI or rapid mouse movement for your target selection, instead focusing fire precisely on your pursuer until it's time to turn tail and flee.    Conquest isn't Smite's only available mode. Players not attracted to the crawl of early-game laning will find the deathmatch-oriented Arena mode strong enough to stand on its own legs. Two teams of gods are dropped into a coliseum setting with a crowd cheering or jeering as the attrition tug-of-war scoring pulls in either direction. The stadium crowd even claps familiar sports cheers as it observes the deific skirmish. This mode offers short games of nonstop action with plenty of thriller comebacks and close calls that get your heart racing until the final moment. If the Arena's chaos isn't enough, the genre staple All Random, All Mid makes an appearance under the name Assault, guaranteeing a unique experience in every game with its random selection.  Developer Hi-Rez knows that variety is the spice of life and ensures such is available in Smite with a cycling mode of the day, featuring focused game types with a specific selection of thematic gods, such as the Assault variant Wet and Wild with only Poseidon and He Bo as selectable gods, or Egyptian Roulette, which grants you a random Egyptian god on a Domination-type map with three control points over which you must battle for control. With a grand total of 55 different daily playlists to choose from, and Saturday's choice put to community vote, the game lets you escape the potential redundancy of the default modes in a fantastic manner.  Game modes aren't the only examples of variety in Smite. Hi-Rez left no cairn stone unturned when selecting the deities to use in the game. The core Greek, Norse, and Egyptian gods are present, but alongside them come Chinese legends Sun Wukong and Ao Kuang, Hindu gods, and even the obscure Mayan god of bees, Ah Muzen Cab, and the howler monkey god, Hun Batz. The gods are fairly balanced in the five archetypical roles of hunter, guardian, assassin, warrior, and mage, although the mage carries a larger champion pool than the rest. Warriors and hunters deal physical damage, while the other three deal magical damage. Players who wish to experiment with hybrid item builds or attempt to play a mage as a hunter will be a bit disappointed to find the attack damage items missing from a mage's shop and similarly for hunters and (magical) power items. While the lack of innovation in item builds may be a bit of a downer, its offset by the reduction in potential item builds with the intention to troll.  Smite is free-to-play and supports itself through microtransactions, which may be used to unlock gods more quickly or to give your god a different appearance in battle. Smite offers a package of all the game's gods, present and upcoming, for a very attractive $30; most rival games offer an incomplete bundle of champions for a similar price, giving Smite the edge when it comes to value for your money. Many skins in Smite are also available to purchase through the earned-through-play currency, rewarding you for your loyalty even if you choose to play the game entirely for free.  With just a few changes to what other games have delivered before, Smite manages to feel like a brand-new game. Furthering the comparison of Smite's platform to other MOBAs, Smite strays from the account progression mechanics that affect in-game powers such as runes and masteries from League of Legends. While your account does earn a level from 1 to 30, the only direct effect it has on gameplay is unlocking the game's ranked league play once you reach level 30. Summoner spells from League of Legends are also a no-show in Smite, with Smite instead electing to tie such powerful abilities to in-game purchased active items, which can be further upgraded with gold investment as opposed to furthering your core item build. Devoting time to one god at a time earns you worshippers, who serve no purpose other than to display a mastery level. This cosmetic ranking allows you a bit of self-satisfaction as the loading screen for each match shows how many mastery levels you've earned with both your account and the god you've chosen for the particular match.  Smite is a godsend for the MOBA genre, with the heart of its gameplay proving that innovation to the war plan for tower siege games is possible. With just a few changes to what other games have delivered before, Smite manages to feel like a brand-new game. There's no cost to join, and no mechanics that directly make players who have been around longer better at the game, making it easy to get into. Once in, it's hard to keep yourself from following a new god: Smite."
4751,NBA Live 08,3.0,0,"  EA proved with Madden that it could tailor a sports game to take advantage of the strengths of the Wii. Unfortunately, it has proved the exact opposite with NBA Live 08. It's ugly, the controls are terrible, and the game is nearly unplayable.      Like Madden, NBA Live offers ""family style"" controls that require only the remote, as well as ""advanced play"" controls that utilize both the remote and Nunchuk. Both styles are equally bad. If you select family style, the game controls all of your players' movement. All you do on offense is press A or the D pad to pass to whomever is highlighted, then flick the remote sideways for a layup or dunk, or flick it up and then down to take a jump shot. On defense, you move the Wii Remote up and/or down to block and rebound. (We don't understand it either, but that's what the manual says.) You can also move the remote left or right to steal, and press B to pressure the ball. With the advanced controls you still do all of the remote-waving nonsense, but now you have (some) control over where your players go on both offense and defense.        However, it doesn't really matter what control style you pick because the gameplay is a complete wreck. Players slide all over the court, completely disappear and reappear, don't take shots when you want them to, and can't play a lick of defense. It gets worse. Anyone within about eight feet of the hoop can go from standing still with his back to the basket to a flying dunk or layup with a flick of the remote. Steals are so frequent that you can't even tell what's going on sometimes because the camera is changing back and forth so quickly. Seemingly every time you go to pass the ball, the icon switches and the ball goes to someone else--often to someone who's a foot away. Yeah, that's a great time for a bounce pass. There's more, though. You can make layups from behind the three-point line, and players can pass right through each other. Furthermore, it's pointless to rotate the Nunchuk for different dribble moves, and it doesn't seem to matter when you release your shot--it's probably going in.      But the biggest issue--the erratic motion-sensing--is the icing on the cake. You'll spend most of your time flicking the controller around like an insane person and hoping against hope that something will happen because the Wii recognizes only about half of your controller input. Every once in a while the game will shock you and actually be playable for 30 seconds here and there, but it's not much better than when you were a kid and you used to stand at an arcade machine and pretend you were playing because you didn't have a quarter to actually play the game. You're little more than a spectator to this train wreck.     Hopefully you don't want any sort of dynasty mode because the closest thing Live 08 on the Wii has is a single-season option. You can trade players, but that's about it. There are no contracts to sign, no players to scout, and no practices to schedule. Admittedly, some of that isn't really missed, but the dynasty mode appears in every other iteration of the game, so its omission is curious. There's not even a create-a-player option. There is a superstar challenge mode where you try to recreate great player performances from the likes of Vince Carter, Kobe Bryant, and Gilbert Arenas. As a concept it's fine, but it's rendered worthless by the lousy gameplay. Live 08 is also one of the first Wii games to support online play. Considering the omission of dynasty mode, it's not surprising that there is no online league option, and you can play only ranked and unranked games. But the online portion of the game works as advertised--too bad that the rest of the game doesn't.     Rounding out the underwhelming package are the slam-dunk contest and three-point shootout. The three-point shootout is a piece of cake: You flick the remote to the right to pick up a ball, move it up to jump, and move it down to release. It's excruciatingly easy and kind of lame because moving the remote down to release the ball doesn't coincide with what the onscreen player is doing. The slam-dunk contest isn't just kind of lame--it's really lame. You pick a dunk from a list and then move the remote in the direction of the two arrows that appear onscreen. We don't have a monkey in the office to test this theory, but it's reasonable to assume that just about any primate capable of holding the remote could successfully perform a dunk here. Where are all the cool minigames that Madden got? EA could at least hook people up with a few training exercises or something.     NBA Live's visuals serve only to add insult to injury, and they actually hurt the gameplay. Defense is almost impossible due to all of the warping and clipping that takes place. This problem is compounded by the lack of transition animation, so essentially you're trying to defend a player that can disappear, go through you, and then go from a standstill to full speed in the blink of an eye. There doesn't appear to be any widescreen option; consequently, the picture is stretched to fill the screen if have the Wii set to widescreen and the players all look fat. You can set the Wii to 4:3, but then you get black bars on either side of your screen if you've got a widescreen set. The graphics' problems are further exacerbated by the players' inordinately large heads. The lighting isn't too bad and the game's fairly colorful, but both the players and the court are extremely aliased.         Once again, the duo of Steve Kerr and Marv Albert is nearly as good in video game form as they are on television. They do a fine job of keeping up with the action, and they mix in a nice bit of analysis and banter in-between. Ernie Johnson and Greg Anthony do a great job calling the All-Star Weekend events. They're always good, but they're at their best when the competitors are at their worst--they'll really let you hear it if you stink.     Live 08 is more a mystery than it is a basketball game. The two biggest questions are ""What in the world was EA thinking when it made this game?"" and ""Is there anyone in the world that would enjoy playing it?"" The answer to the first question has yet to be determined, but as for who would enjoy this game, the answer is ""nobody.""  "
2590,SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny,6.0,1,"SpellForce 2, however, have spent that many years waiting not for its sequel, but for the game's next expansion. Finally, you can once again experience the unique mix of RPG mechanics and real-time strategy that made SpellForce 2's initial release such a success. And that's part of the problem. After so long a wait, Faith in Destiny feels like more of the same despite a handful of tweaks.        Faith in Destiny is a stand-alone expansion, fortunately, which means you won't have to spend hours looking through old hard drives if you want to pick up where you left off after Dragon Storm, SpellForce 2's only other expansion. At the same time, it's also a little surprising to discover that the story unfolds as if this were 2007 and you still had fresh memories of the struggle with the Shaper in your head. As a result, important names drop without background, characters mention key concepts without much context, and it takes some time or some digging for new players to realize the importance of the portals everyone keeps talking about.     The perfunctory explanations are a shame, because the plot revolves around those very portals. In the four in-game years since the Shaper's defeat, the portals that link the islands of the world have broken down, and the best minds of the other races have no idea how to fix them. If that's not bad enough, a troublesome race of demons known as the Nameless terrorize the countryside with impunity. Naturally, the task of fixing all this falls on your shoulders. You play as a Shaikan who must also find out why he's plagued with horrible dreams.    Shadow Wars and Dragon Storm. When the story is at its worst, poor voice acting and animations in the cinematics--a step down for the franchise in almost every way--season the heavily accented interactions with dwarves and dragons with unintended humor.         If only the combat weren't so clunky. Getting the most out of the system requires assigning abilities for both your Shaikan hero and his various companions to specific hotbars, but the absence of customizable hotkeys renders combat more taxing than necessary. When it comes time to use these abilities on specific enemies (or toss heals on allies), you must perform acrobatics such as using your mouse to select your character, clicking on a spell or ability from the hotbars, and then clicking on the intended target. That's complicated enough for one hero in the absence of hotkeys, but it almost becomes unmanageable once you extend the practice to your companions.        Reaching a base in one of the four campaign maps usually triggers the real-time strategy elements. For the most part, these revolve around the base building, troop and worker creation, and resource management common to games like Starcraft, and streamlined mechanics (such as workers who focus on only one specific resource) alleviate some of the need to micromanage while also controlling your hero.      Simplified group selection tools for troops and laborers mark a welcome touch, but beyond some other minor interface tweaks, there's very little in the way of growth in this expansion, aside from an opportunity for heroes to mount and fly a dragon--a change that doesn't have as big of an impact as it sounds like it should. Still, Faith in Destiny is enjoyable once resources start pouring in and troops start moving. The flawed dance of RPG stylings and RTS gameplay might make missions longer than necessary, but it's still easy to see what made SpellForce 2's appearance in 2006 so appealing.     The visuals, unfortunately, haven't fared so well. SpellForce 2 may have been one of the better-looking takes on the real-time strategy genre when it first appeared, but now its dated character models and environments are decidedly unimpressive. It's a pity that more effort wasn't at least spent on smoothing the jagged edges on most sprites and objects. An option to switch from the isometric camera common to the RTS genre to a more RPG-appropriate third-person view allows for some visual variety, but it's of little value since coordinated attacks still rely on the mechanics of the RTS gameplay.        Beyond the campaign, online and local multiplayer modes for up to six players offer some substantial incentives for replay, particularly since you're provided with a robust creation kit for creating maps and sharing them with the community. The inclusion of the Nameless as a playable faction comes as a refreshing surprise, as does a new Domination mode that calls for capturing and controlling points on the map. If there's a drawback, it's that the multiplayer modes lack the RPG elements that stand out as the series' main contribution to the real-time strategy genre, although their removal succeeds in speeding up the matches.   Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II and its own two expansions. That's not to say that SpellForce 2's hybrid concepts have lost the power to allure, but you'd probably be better served playing SpellForce 2: Shadow Wars and its Dragon Storm expansion if you're a new player wanting to get the most out of a meaningful campaign, especially since Faith in Destiny offers a mere four maps to choose from. The main benefit of playing Faith in Destiny springs from its inclusion of live servers for multiplayer play, but even this comes as a small consolation since the servers are typically empty only a month after release. Longtime fans might enjoy the change of scenery in this blemished offering, but it's clear that the spells this unique franchise weaves just don't have the force they once had.   "
322,Microsoft Flight Simulator,9.0,2,"Microsoft Flight Simulator's greatest boon is how easy it is to start experiencing the wonder of flight. It's a simulator first and foremost, of course--the amount of buttons, knobs, indicators in any one aircraft is staggering. Nearly all of them have a tangible function, too, and it's easy to see how the game could be used to train actual pilots to operate particular planes or navigate certain routes. But the first thing Flight Simulator throws up at you is a menu to determine your level of assistance--a whole manner of optional modifiers and notifications are there to help you get in the air or guide you on what to do and how to do it. At its most basic level, it's easy to get into the sky very quickly with minimal input using only a gamepad.Microsoft Flight Simulator pushes you to learn more, though. The tutorial attempts to teach you how to read the dials and meters in your cockpit, runs you through basic flight theory and etiquette, and guides you on how to navigate your way through the air by yourself. While my experience with arcade flight games led me to choose a middle-ground experience that let me control the plane in a mostly realistic manner, I found myself very eager to learn more. I wanted to stay in the incredibly detailed cockpit view more often in order to try and internalise the meter readings. I wanted to know what all the dials and buttons did and when to use them. At the time of writing, I'm now at the point where I'm operating my plane primarily through manual activation with my mouse and keyboard, using a controller only for its analog stick, and I feel incredibly accomplished.In my mind, it feels like I'm actually learning how to operate the plane in the exact manner I would in real life--and though that's something I can't confirm, it is a fascinating idea that continues to motivate me to try new planes, see what all the buttons do, and try to keep them up in the sky. Microsoft Flight Simulator drives this feeling so much that after hours of virtual flight time, I'm more eager than ever for more tutorials. I want more lessons about the intricacies of flight theory and wish the game had included plane-specific training sessions or airport-specific practice exercises where you can get run-throughs of the quirks of everything.In fact, once you're done with training, Microsoft Flight Simulator offers very little in terms of structured activities. There are Landing Challenges, which give you specific conditions to land planes in as best you can in order to slap a high score on a leaderboard. There is also a small selection of Bush Flights--multi-leg journeys through locations that challenge your navigational skills and endurance--which range from seven to nine hours in length, a fact I only realised an hour into one.But the core of Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the game's most remarkable feature, is its freeform mode where you pick and customise an aircraft, set your time of day and weather conditions, maybe chart a predetermined route, and then literally fly anywhere you want on a faithful, one-to-one recreation of the planet Earth. The whole Earth.It is surreal, and it is astonishing. The first real thing I did in Flight Simulator was hop into a 787 Dreamliner at Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney and immediately shat myself looking at the overwhelmingly imposing control panel--the tutorial propeller plane had certainly not prepared me for this. The next real thing I did was take to the air and find the Sydney Opera House. Then, I found my office and performed my commute home, following the roads back to my house and identifying major landmarks along the way. I continued following roads and highways I knew to my parents' house--in a suburb that I thought I would never, ever see in a video game--and performed a terrible landing at the regional airport near where I grew up. Flight Simulator uses a combination of machine learning, map data, and a technique called photogrammetry to create an accurate depiction of our world. While this first flight of mine was incredibly mundane, the familiarity of the streets and buildings I was seeing as I flew my passenger jet far too close to the ground made it a stupefying experience, demonstrating to me the fact that this simulation was pulling no punches. It's hard not to be impressed by the feat of it.The feeling of being able to tame a realistic simulation of a complex flight machine is exciting, and the feeling is magnified by being able to use those actions to fly over and visit what you understand to be authentic recreations of real-world locations from high in the air. Microsoft Flight Simulator is an astounding tool for virtual tourism. I continue to have my breath taken away flying over both familiar locations and places I can now only dream of visiting in real life--Mt. Fuji, Mecca, the North Pole, the Amazon rainforest, and that really good taco stand in Downtown LA. Live weather, time, and air traffic data add an extra layer of simulated realism that can make these trips feel extra special, but playing with the simulation to create your own scenarios (like trying to land a plane in the San Francisco fog) is just as delightful. The endless possibilities for self-guided activities are inspiring.Charting and flying a real-time route from A to B will regularly result in long stretches where your ability to competently fly a plane won't be tested at any great length, and in these moments it's wonderful to just turn on the autopilot and quietly admire the exquisite scenery out the window, thinking about how insignificant you are in the grand scheme of things. It's a unique and sublime experience you can lose yourself again and again. You can also share the experience flying tandem online with friends, which is a very pleasant way to catch up and chat (Where we droppin'? Literally anywhere on Earth.)Flight Simulator's recreation of our world isn't perfect, however. The algorithmic mapping has its fair share of amusing oddities that presented themselves to me right away--while the Sydney Opera House's unique shape was modelled in-game, the iconic arch of the nearby Sydney Harbour Bridge was rendered as a flat freeway. But when you're cruising at 30,000 feet in the air, very little of that actually matters. It should be noted, however, that an online marketplace is there to provide options for real-world purchases from official and third-party developers, one of which includes more detailed building models specifically for London. It should also be noted that Flight Simulator features long loading times, even on solid-state hard drives, and the occasional performance drop, even on machines that fly far and above the game's recommended PC specifications. This is likely due to the density and scope of the simulation, as well as the fact that Flight Simulator constantly downloads data to populate the world (though you can tell it not to, at the expense of environment detail).It's a game that gives me anxiety about having to upgrade my computer. But it's also a game that gives me a great sense of calm as I cruise through clouds far above the Earth. Microsoft Flight Simulator is a tremendous experience that makes you appreciate natural beauty and man-made ingenuity in equal measures. Being encouraged to dive into the rabbit hole of learning how to operate genuine, complex machines to perform amazing feats of science is giddying, as is being able to journey across a realistic, mostly accurate depiction of our entire, beautiful planet. Microsoft Flight Simulator is a spectacular technical achievement and a deeply inspiring experience filled with glorious possibilities. At launch, Microsoft’s Flight Simulator was a challenging task for even the most powerful PCs, making its arrival on consoles an interesting test for the current-generation hardware. As the first Microsoft Studios title exclusive to the new consoles (natively, at least, since the Xbox One is supported through Cloud Gaming), Flight Simulator is one of the first glimpses of what this new hardware can achieve, and it impresses right out of the gate.Playing on the Xbox Series X, Flight Simulator is every bit as breathtaking as its PC counterpart. Optimization work by Asobo Studio has resulted in a visually captivating 4K presentation running at 30fps, which allows you to take in the gorgeous sunsets and blinding lightning strikes that can accompany a transatlantic flight. You'll be hard-pressed to find any significant compromises in order to maintain this level of performance without scrutinizing a side-by-side of this latest Xbox version and the nearly year-old PC version, with both benefiting from the additional visual content that Asobo has launched over the past few months. This includes improved geometry streaming that fills in the entire world with data from photogrammetry, as well as more personal touches such as new, detailed airports.Getting in close to dense cityscapes or generated mountain ranges does expose some of the limitations of this procedural approach to populating the world, but at that point you're already far off the course Flight Simulator expects you to be. While soaring up above, it's difficult to not admire the sheer beauty of the planet from another perspective. Performance can dip slightly in spots, especially in some of the most demanding metropolitans during certain times of day. The frame rate can noticeably dip as you're panning the camera to admire the view but given that you're not meant to be making twitch, quick maneuvers it's easier to excuse in terms of its impact on gameplay.It's a visually stunning showcase that really pushes the Xbox Series X, making it a great first title to exist solely on Microsoft's latest hardwareWhat's a little harder to overlook is the game's user-interface, which has been stripped from the PC version in a way that doesn't always feel at home on a console. There are loads of menus to sort through, often forcing you to engage with an on-screen cursor that you control with thumbsticks. It feels imprecise and sluggish most of the time, which becomes a bother when you're using the same system to navigate dense control dashboards of more sophisticated planes and trying to turn a specific dial or flip one awkwardly placed switch.Controlling flight on a controller is, thankfully, a lot better, with a decent balance of options mapped as default to give you a great sense of control in the air while not stripping away the enthusiast fundamentals of the series. Of course, all of this can be customized, letting you tune your experience however you see fit. More dedicated players will likely want to invest in a full HOTAS setup for the most authentic experience, but many are sadly still incompatible with the Xbox Series X. Perhaps one of the best changes to Flight Simulator on console is the tweaks to its tutorials, most of which are now slightly shorter and more focused than what originally launched on PC. These are great guided sessions that can be as simple or complex as you want them to be, getting you up to speed in the air quickly and offering more in-depth lessons if you want to take your training further. Additionally, new Showcase flights throw you into some of the game's most gorgeous settings with everything setup, letting you soak in its calming ambient music and striking scenes without really needing to fuss with anything. It's a great option for showing the game off to a friend, or just to experience some of the best moments Flight Simulator has to offer without needing to know how to take-off or land first.There's some of the expected friction with this port to the Xbox Series X, which may explain why it's been so long since this series has been released on consoles. Microsoft's Flight Simulator is a dense, carefully crafted tool that's more about authentically replicating an experience than being a game in many ways, which makes translating it to a gaming device a difficult task. But if you're able to get past the overwhelming menus at first, there's many ways to jump in and have a great time with Flight Simulator, whether you're planning to engage deeply with its systems or just take a relaxing flight from one coast to another. It's a visually stunning showcase that really pushes the Xbox Series X, making it a great first title to exist solely on Microsoft's latest hardware."
1394,DiRT Rally,8.0,2,"In Dirt Rally, your co-driver's instructions are as imperative to your survival as your car staying on the road. They're a source of guidance for the severity of each twist of the track, and offer a crucial warning for approaching dangers. Fired off at a rapid clip with almost robotic precision, they ensure that the fear of the unknown is offset by the calm, informative voice sitting next to you. Yet for all the significance of their direction, there’s one phrase that stands out more than any other, and that's ""be brave."" I'm not sure what coaxes it out of your intrepid co-driver, but once in a blue moon he'll tell you to be brave, offering up a moment of encouragement--and a slice of humanity--amidst pinpoint instruction. It’s a rare phrase that summarises my time with Dirt Rally, because you won't get very far in Codemasters' latest without showing a little dare.This is due in no small part to a punishing difficulty curve that has earned Dirt Rally quite the reputation since its release on Steam Early Access 11 months ago. By abandoning the series' previous American flavour and arcade-style racing, Dirt Rally differentiates itself from its predecessors by presenting an uncompromising simulation of rally racing that has more in common with 2004's Richard Burns Rally than anything released in the interim. With a phenomenal new physics engine, a plethora of variables that affect each stage, and a challenging assortment of beloved courses, Dirt Rally demands a lot from players. And in the move to consoles, its notorious challenge has remained fully intact--which is certainly cause for celebration.Dirt Rally's demanding difficulty might alienate some racing game fans, but this console release includes 21 tutorials to help ease players in for a slightly less bumpy ride. They’re by no means perfect--mainly because they’re not actually playable--but each video tutorial is suitably in-depth and informative, basically out of necessity. The robust driving model means there's a range of techniques you'll want to learn--from how to perform a Scandinavian flick, to executing an opposite lock. The game even explores the mindset you'll want to approach each stage with. These tutorials are useful even if you just want to jump in and learn about one particular aspect of rally, but with no convenient way to practice, you will still have to hop onto the track and figure things out the hard way.Dirt Rally is a triumphant return to form for CodemastersThis isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, because if you stick with it long enough you'll unearth a satisfying sense of progression once you get the hang of things. But with the type of car (be it four-wheel, front-wheel, or rear-wheel drive), the weather, time of day, altitude, and driving surface all playing crucial roles in how you approach each stage, getting comfortable is easier said than done.The console version does at least keep up with its PC counterpart. With a wealth of cars to tame--each giving your thumb a considerable workout as you wrestle just to keep them on the road--it’s commendable that the PlayStation 4 version maintains a steady 60fps throughout, ensuring a fantastic sense of speed and ensuring each twitch of the wheel is just as responsive as you would expect.You'll need it, too, with the wildly disparate traits of each stage providing one tenacious challenge after another. Take the snowy tundra of Sweden as an example. You have to account not only for its icy slick roads but also the mounds of shovelled snow that tightly funnel you to the finish line. Veer slightly too far to the left or right and they're likely to spin you out or leave you on your roof. Or there’s the undulating paths and man-made obstacles in Germany, where deviously placed rocks prevent you from even thinking about cutting a corner and hay bales turn a simple straight into a tricky chicane. Even Monaco, and the relative safety of its tarmac roads, becomes a nightmare as its grippy surface is suddenly covered in near-gripless sheets of ice, turning parked cars into terrifying obstacles.All of these stages make up the bulk of the career mode as you compete in a number of rally championships. These are lengthy multi-staged events where you compete against AI drivers to set the best time. Any damage sustained here is persistent throughout the championship, so if you play in first-person and suffer a large crack across your windscreen, that’s going to stay there for the duration. Other damage, like kinks to your engine, gearbox, tyres, and so on, can be fixed by a customisable team of engineers, trading your time for repairs. Catastrophic damage, however, will put an end to any championship run, even if you're a few stages deep. Sure, you can simply restart the stage over again. But the trepidation that accompanies each bump and bend when you know that one wrong move can spell the end is so thrilling, and the reward for finishing so gratifying, that I urge anyone to resist the temptation to restart.Elsewhere, Hillclimb and Rallycross make up the rest of the career; the former letting you tackle the famous Pike's Peak in, Dirt Rally's greatest challenge, while the latter pits you against three AI or human drivers in short, combustible races. They're both enjoyable asides, but with a limited track selection, they feel half-baked when stacked up against the density of its rally offering. Fortunately, the console release does introduce some lower tier Rallycross vehicles, so you won't have to suffer through races with less capable vehicles at the start. While this doesn’t quite solve Dirt Rally's grinding problem, it's alleviated somewhat with earlier access other modes.Despite a few issues, Dirt Rally is a triumphant return to form for Codemasters. The PS4 version arrives as a slightly more fleshed-out package at release and its technical performance is admirable. It's still mightily difficult, but if you're a rally enthusiast or even just have a passing interest in a challenging racing game, you can’t go wrong with Dirt Rally."
3839,Ecco Jr.,5.0,1,"  To put it mildly, Ecco Jr. lacks the challenge and purpose found in the previous Ecco the Dolphin games. Rather than fix the aimless mazes or collision problems people experienced in the first two games, the developers instead chose to strip away the hazards and breath meter entirely, gearing the third game toward the littlest of little ones.     Ecco Jr. is a 2D underwater adventure that puts players in control of a young bottlenose dolphin or an Orca whale. On the normal setting, there are 18 missions to complete. The hard setting doesn't make things more difficult, it simply adds nine more missions to the mix. For each of those missions, you have to navigate underwater caverns and perform various collect-a-thon tasks, such as gathering pieces of treasure or bringing a baby turtle back to its mother. The controls are easy to master because you only have to worry about using the D pad to swim, one button to kick in a burst of speed, and the other button to fire a sonar beacon that helps Ecco latch onto items. Enemies can't hurt you in Ecco Jr., so there was no reason to include the ramming attack and killer sonar from the previous games.        Indeed, Ecco Jr. is the Ecco the Dolphin experience whittled down to its bare essentials. The levels are small, which means you'll rarely feel lost, and gathering the items you need to unlock each key glyph only takes a minute or two. You don't have to worry about running out of health or breath. Sharks, jellyfish, and other nasties from the previous games are merely window decorations. About the only time you'll feel any challenge at all is during the tag missions, which involve tagging another dolphin and rushing to the exit before it tags you back. There's no story. In fact, there's no text dialogue whatsoever to ""slow things down."" From start to finish, Ecco Jr. takes roughly an hour to complete.     Most people would find the combination of tiny levels, repetitive tasks, and invulnerability a recipe for boredom, but those concessions probably won't bother a little one who's handed the controller then told that he or she gets to be a dolphin. That's the one aspect, at least, that Ecco Jr. has in common with the other games in the series. It's still sweet to watch Ecco swim through underwater locations and break up schools of tropical fish. It's also still very fun to leap out of the water at full speed just to watch Ecco make a big splash on reentry.     Video games, just like movies, are made for various audiences. For the bulk of the gaming audience, Ecco Jr. is hardly a game and barely worth the cost of the 800 Wii points ($8) to download. However, if you have young children lurking nearby, there's a good chance they'll be captivated by Ecco's antics long enough to justify the cost and to pick up some of the basic skills that will serve them well as they join the next generation of game players.    "
3469,DeathSpank,8.0,2,"     Why are ancient artifacts so revered? DeathSpank, the titular star of this action role-playing game, is on a quest to obtain a mythical artifact, even though he doesn't have a clue as to what kind of power it holds. Even more baffling is the purple thong the hero wears, regardless of how cold it is outside. But those mysteries are but small parts of the adventure. The story is little more than an elaborate fetch quest, but it's the trappings around this cliche plot that make your plundering so engrossing. This game is absolutely brimming with personality. All of the people you meet along the way have an oddball idea about how the world functions, and they get their points across in an over-the-top style that is sometimes funny but always goofy. Every dialogue you enter into has a conversation tree that may not always imbue useful knowledge, but it's worth going through all the options just to see what's on the minds of these citizens. DeathSpank is bursting with whimsy and silly nods to modern-day conventions, which makes it a joy to see what lies ahead.      Of course, you're not going to spend all your time talking to your wacky neighbors. The majority of the game centers on the combat, and though it isn't very deep, it does manage to stay entertaining for the most part. You have eight separate buttons (the D pad and the face buttons) to map items, magic, and weapons to, which gives you a fair bit of flexibility in how you want to prepare your warrior. Although the majority of the fights require little more effort than slamming on your attack buttons, there is more strategy for those who would rather win in style. Powerful combos can be strung together if you alternate which weapon you attack with, and it's fun to mix and match your swords, cleavers, and other pointy death tools to find a combination that works for you. There are also magical abilities that are not only effective ways to dispatch foes, but also add a bit more humor to the proceedings. Summoning an orphan to your side or shooting a clutch of angry chickens is part of the goofy fun, though most of your attacks are conventional.        A steady stream of dropped loot ensures you regularly gain access to new gadgets. The game automatically equips the best armor for you (if you select that option), which means there isn't a reason to spend time figuring out the best protection, but choosing the right item or spell in a pinch can be the difference between life and death. Although it's easy to fall back on standard melee or crossbow attacks for the majority of battles, there are so many potions and magic spells to play around with that it's more effective to test out these abilities as frequently as possible. You can cause fire to rain down from above, conjure a black hole, or even shrink yourself to a bite-size proportion to avoid an angry beast, and the supply of new items is so large that you don't have to worry too much about running out. It's a great system that adds a bit of spice to the normally repetitive hack-and-slash action. You still spend more time mindlessly mashing buttons than trying out new tricks and tactics, but the wide assortment of weapons and items keeps things fresh.     The simplicity of the combat unfortunately stretches to other aspects as well, and the results are not always as successful. You don't have much say in how your character grows as you progress. Every time you level up, you get to choose one of three hero cards that give you a boost to one of your abilities. For instance, you can walk faster or up your melee attack power. However, there's a finite number of these cards, and by the end of the game, you unlock just about every ability. So your choice ultimately boils down to what order you want to unlock these perks in rather than the ability to mold your hero in a specific image. The cooperative play is also quite limited. A second player can jump in at any time (locally only), but must play as the googly-eyed Sparkles the Wizard rather than a unique hero. Player two doesn’t have access to looted weapons or items either. Rather, Sparkles has a repertoire of four preset moves, as well as the ability to teleport to DeathSpank's side. Thankfully, because the combat is fun and the world so inviting, cooperative play still provides a good time. But its limited scope is a missed opportunity.   "
2978,From Dust,8.0,2,"  What if you had the powers of a god? The earth would shift at your whim and the seas would tremble at your touch. You could raise mountains, divert rivers, and transform dry deserts into lush forests. From Dust grants you these powers and more, and it's satisfying to wield them as you try to safely usher a small tribe of humans through a perilous world. Yet, for all your world-molding abilities, you are not omnipotent. Like the villagers you shelter, you must contend with the inexorable power of nature. From the subtle influence of gravity and erosion to the devastating forces of volcanoes and tsunamis, nature compels you to adapt to survive. This task can get difficult, especially when imperfect controls, finicky pathfinding, and unforeseeable disasters conspire against you. Joining these in-game problems are a number of PC-specific shortcomings, including limited visual options and an Internet connectivity requirement. Despite these unwelcome elements, the challenge of being a lesser god is an engaging one, and From Dust makes it even more enticing with appealing visuals and evocative music.             In addition to the power of breath, there are a few other helpful elements. Stones grant villages the ability to repel fire, lava, and water, and sending a villager to retrieve this knowledge from a stone is often your best hope for survival, especially when tsunamis roll in and volcanoes erupt. Unfortunately, this is also where you can run into problems with From Dust's pathfinding logic. You can only set destinations for the humans; it's up to them to get there. Though they are generally good at finding any bridges you have built, they are sometimes stymied by a puddle of water or a small hitch in the terrain. These obstacles can sometimes be tough to identify, especially given the (admittedly realistic) translucence of water. Traveling villagers do recalculate routes in an effort to take the quickest path, and though they are often successful, they also take some baffling walkabouts. Furthermore, because the game automatically determines a knowledge bearer's return path, you might watch him run right by a village that is threatened by lava to first deliver the protective knowledge to another, safer village. Depending on your current situation, these pathfinding problems might merely irk you, or they might derail your plans with disastrous consequences. It's one thing to deal with the capriciousness of nature; it's another to suffer from the flaws of man.       Another natural occurrence you must take into account is foliage. Each village spawns a small circle of soil and vegetation, and this vegetation automatically spreads to all nearby dirt-covered land, providing there is some water nearby. If it spreads far enough, you unlock new challenge levels and descriptions of in-game phenomena. However, if any part of your forest comes in contact with lava, it catches on fire and doesn't stop burning until you extinguish the fire or it consumes all its fuel (and any villages in its way). Fire can also be started by fire trees, one of a few special plants that can help or hinder you. The tree of water releases a stored torrent that can extinguish fires or drown villages, while the explosive tree provides your only tool for manipulating rock. Gaining the ability to pick up and replant these trees opens up new strategic possibilities, but it isn't always easy to position your cursor directly beneath them, especially when the explosive trees have done their thing (they grow back if replanted).         Getting to know the humans' movement patterns can help mitigate the pathfinding and fine-control issues, but some levels hit you with environmental upheaval that you simply can't anticipate. There is usually a warning when a tsunami will hit, but what about the spring you unearth that drowns your village? Or the volcano that suddenly claims a hillside and sets off a vicious wildfire? Adapting to these unforeseen circumstances is sometimes frustrating, but it also contributes to the unpredictability that makes From Dust so engaging. Consequences you didn't expect or slow changes to the landscape that turn into imminent dangers force you to adapt quickly and find creative solutions. Though the pacing is uneven, offering too many static levels and a few drastic difficulty spikes, From Dust's Story mode does a great job of teaching you how to mold the world and testing your prowess and adaptability.      Challenge mode provides a fun proving ground for those skills. It consists of 30 levels that last a few minutes at most and set specific victory conditions. The purpose-built maps offer a wider variety of unique puzzles than appear in Story mode, though the quality is a bit uneven. Some are mere physics showcases in which the solution is exceedingly simple; some are brutal races against the clock that demand precise manipulation. The ones that require you to think beyond your first instincts and really flex your understanding of the From Dust world are the best, though each offers at least the small pleasure of seeing what the developers have concocted. Making your way through all 30 is indeed a challenge (and first you must unlock them all in Story mode), and online leaderboards that track your times provide surprisingly effective fuel for competition. You may have solved a challenge one way only to find out that other players completed it with drastically better times, indicating that there is more to the level than you might have guessed. The key here is that you earn bonus time for completing your actions early and letting events run their course, so finesse and simplicity are paramount to scoring well.         "
4915,Mission: Humanity,2.0,0," 	Remember the great real-time strategy gold rush of the late '90s? During this period, games such as Command &amp; Conquer, Total Annihilation, and Starcraft all helped define the conventions of this popular genre. Unfortunately, EON Digital Entertainment's Mission: Humanity is sort of like the three-legged pack mule that arrived embarrassingly late to collect its share of the bullion. The game attempts to capture some of the strategic gameplay and epic sci-fi adventure in which its early predecessors excelled. Instead, because of its ugly graphics, bad sound, faulty artificial intelligence, and extremely dull gameplay, it winds up crashing to the ground like some ill-fated hydrogen blimp. Oh, the humanity!  Mission: Humanity doesn't even offer a decent premise. According to the manual, Mission: Humanity is a real-time strategy game set in the ""not-so-distant future."" Aliens have plundered Earth, and the human population has somewhat successfully appropriated the alien technology to its own advantage. Haven't you heard this one before? And it's just about all the briefing you get. There are no cutscenes to further the plot during the course of the game.   That's just the tip of the iceberg. Upon first playing, you'll probably notice that by today's standards, the units look about as outdated as those in the first Command &amp; Conquer game--only a lot worse. Of course, when you see the first unit suddenly disappear into thin air after it gets shot, you'll also wish you were playing Command &amp; Conquer instead. The sounds aren't any better than the graphics, either. No matter which unit you select--or even which side you're playing, for that matter--the responding voice is exactly the same, save for a few variations. Furthermore, the bland, techno-inspired music couldn't be more forgettable.  As you might expect, Mission: Humanity's gameplay completely falls flat. As in many real-time strategy games, you begin by building a base and power plant and then proceed to mine for resources. You advance through the game by conquering the current planet you're on, thereby moving on to the next planet. There's a bit of a twist; you actually need to keep track of all the planets under your control, and can reallocate resources and troops between them. Also, the battles take place on spherical maps, which are supposed to be suggestive of a spherical planetary surface; hence there are no boundaries on the maps, because they simply wrap around. You may upgrade technology, but initially there are only three unit types available. Actually, these three units are all you get for the majority of the game! If you have the patience, you can play until a fourth unit becomes available later. And if you have nerves of steel, you can conquer all the planets up to the final alien home planet. At this stage, the game actually switches to an interior isometric view of the alien base. The idea of conquering planet after planet until finally infiltrating the alien home base is actually pretty good. But the execution of this idea in Mission: Humanity is poor, and offers little reward for the effort required in getting that far. The computer opponent's artificial intelligence is terrible. Often, you'll send units into the fray, and they won't automatically defend themselves from oncoming attacks. And this is assuming that you can even get the units to move in the right direction, which isn't a trivial matter since the game's pathfinding is so bad.   If for some reason you're still interested in this third-rate real-time strategy game, it's also worth noting that far superior games of the same ilk now sell at a discount for around $10 less. There really is nothing good and nothing redeeming about Mission: Humanity.      	  "
4336,Operation Armored Liberty,4.0,0," The old Super NES and Genesis tank combat game Super Battletank is back on the GBA in the form of Majesco's Operation Armored Liberty. The premise isn't all that complicated, but it is relevant to current events. You play the part of a tank crew in Iraq. The game has you driving around places like Basra and Tikrit, engaging Saddam's tank, SCUD, and helicopter forces in real-time, first-person combat. Majesco has updated the missions to reflect the events of the second Iraq war, but it hasn't done anything to add to the game's fun factor or overall length. As such, most players will have their fill of Operation Armored Liberty in an hour or two.      Even though the game uses every button on the GBA, it's actually pretty simple. You use the directional pad and shoulder buttons to steer and to control the cannon turret, the A and B buttons to accelerate and to fire the selected weapon, and the select and start buttons to switch weapons and to pull up an overhead map of the terrain. Combat takes place from a first-person viewpoint, which is to say that you can see the terrain and enemy vehicles unfold in front of you as you drive forward. When you get close enough to another tank or helicopter, you need to aim the cannon and destroy the target with one of your tank's four different weapons. Aiming is the most challenging aspect of the game, since enemy vehicles usually do their best to outrun and outmaneuver you. Even so, it takes only three or four shots with the main cannon to take out most opponents. The tank also has a smaller 7mm cannon, laser guided bombs, and a smoke system. Running out of fuel is another concern, but most missions have one or two single-use refueling convoys that you can take advantage of.   Whether or not you enjoy fast-paced vehicle shooting games, there just isn't enough to Operation Armored Liberty to hold anyone's interest for long. The enemy AI is immensely dumb, and there are only 10 different missions to play. To be honest, Majesco has converted Super Battletank to the GBA fairly well. The company just didn't bother to improve some of the weaker aspects of the original game, which are more obvious now than they were in 1992.      The game also doesn't do much to tax the graphical and audio capabilities of the GBA. More than half of the screen is eaten up by the cockpit, compass, and weapon displays. The terrain rolls by in a small window in the center of the screen, and you need to aim the crosshair at enemy vehicles when they come into view. It's easy to appreciate how photo-realistic the various Iraqi tanks, choppers, and SCUD launchers look, but the terrain is almost devoid of features, and the animation is choppy, choppy, choppy. As for the audio, the soundtrack is totally composed of the sounds from the tank's engine and the various weapons at your disposal. When you're not firing away or listening to a loud explosion, all you'll hear is the din of the engine.   Right out of the gate, Majesco has released Operation Armored Liberty at a budget price point of around 20 dollars. While that might temper a few of the game's shortcomings for some people, the low price alone isn't enough to offset the fact that this is one game you'll play for two hours and then put away for good. "
1812,Lords of the Fallen (2014),8.0,2,"Dark Souls, yet distinct enough to earn its own spotlight and, perhaps, to earn your affection as well. Harkyn himself is not easy to love, but ultimately, he doesn't matter as much as the world he serves and the hammers he swings. ""World"" might be too generous a word, actually: You spend most of your time in corridors and combat arenas, not gazing onto spacious landscapes. Lords of the Fallen's dramatic citadel and hushed monastery are suffering from the invasion of otherworldly flesh-monsters and armored behemoths. Snowy peaks may rise in the distance, but you will not be breathing in their refreshing air. Lords of the Fallen means to choke you with smoke and poison, and to crush you between the stone slabs that line its monumental suspended bridge. The view from this bridge says more about this world than words can convey. Ahead of you lies the gaping maw of a demonic temple hungry for your flesh. The massive chains that connect your destination to the bridge must have taken hundreds of hours to forge. Two colossal soldiers are carved into the mountain on either side of the entrance, warning you of the blood that will soon be spilled. This is Lords of the Fallen: ponderous and unwelcoming. There is no hiding from its dangers.   Unwisely, the game insists on trying to weave a coherent story into these spaces, with each of Harkyn's cohorts and various audio logs tossing up a word salad that does little to get you invested. In time, the story begins to make sense, but this cliched tale of the balance between good and evil isn't the reason to press on. Instead, it's better to let the frozen walkways and giant braziers speak for themselves. You may begin your adventure in a holy sanctuary, but this place seeks to murder you. Consider the titles of the bosses you fight. Guardian. Beast. Champion. Who needs proper names, when ""Annihilator"" gets the point across? These titans and their lesser cohorts have no other purpose than to kill. You fight several such rivals in the first few hours (out of 20 or so) alone, though it takes time to reach the most formidable ones. In the meanwhile, you roam the game's corridors from a third-person perspective, swinging an axe or sword, dodging or blocking incoming attacks, and occasionally calling on the gods of magic to give you a hand when you most need it. It's almost impossible not to draw the obvious comparisons to the Souls series here. An energy meter depletes when you block, roll, and attack, forcing you to closely manage your defenses lest you leave yourself vulnerable to damage. Different melee weapons require different approaches, but Lords of the Fallen gives each of them an authentic sense of weight. Combat requires understanding of how long it takes to swing that humongous greatsword you carry, and how much time that fire-breathing < thing you're fighting takes to prepare its next blow. Lords of the Fallen's dramatic citadel and hushed monastery are suffering from the invasion of otherworldly flesh-monsters and armored behemoths. So far, so Dark Souls then. Compared head to head, Souls games are superior to Lords of the Fallen in most given areas: Dark Souls is more mysterious, more difficult, and more diverse, and Lords of the Fallen features no online connectivity. To call Lords of the Fallen a poor man's Dark Souls sells it entirely too short, however. For one, Lords of the Fallen strikes a different kind of tone. It is moody and oppressive, but rarely terrifying; it is a power fantasy, not a heart-wrenching death simulator that rolls deadly boulders at you as if you are a single, miniscule bowling pin. The art style reflects the difference: armor and architecture is less Medieval, chunkier and excessively ornate, mirroring Harkyn's strength and confidence. Lords of the Fallen has a few challenges, but it's rare for you to feel frail or afraid: the game simply isn't hard enough to make your blood boil. That's at least true in the main world; the visits you make to a shadowy and sinister otherworld are more frightening. Those visits bring great reward if you can conquer the darkness. Traversing this otherworld is like exploring a foggy dessert during the witching hour: you can barely see further than the tip of your blade, which make the occasional glimpse of light a true ray of hope. There is tribulation to undergo, however, before you reach possible treasure. Your steps into the beyond lead you first to easily-dispatched knights and mutants, which require only that you put the finicky targeting system to good use. Soon, though, you could encounter a rolling fire demon whose flaming carapace will quickly scorch your flesh. Your introduction to this dimension is a limited one, fortunately: you open a few treasure chests in the hope of finding a rune for upgrading your equipment, a new armor set, or an item that temporarily protects you from poison, and then return to the land of women and men. You reach this realm by entering portals that only unlock when you have killed some unknown beast. You will come to identify an available nearby portal by the crackles and creaks it makes as it opens, as if it's made of ancient tendons that haven't often had a chance to stretch. The grind to level up is minimal, and while death is likely, it's not frequent enough to elicit heartache. When you perish, you leave behind your ghost and (usually) revive at whichever ruby crystal you last saved at. Your ghost contains all the experience you have accumulated since the prior death, but it doesn't remain forever, so it's in your best interests to go retrieve it, and to be timely about it, at least in the early hours. Every fallen enemy will have respawned after your death, but you will be armed with the knowledge of what lies ahead of you. You will also be armed with some spells and a gauntlet that shoots out magic projectiles, spews fire, and helps open new pathways. Selecting and casting spells is a matter of pressing or holding a button: there's no need to switch from a dagger to a wand if you want to punch a demon in the groin with your quake skill. There are no bows and arrows in Lords of the Fallen: it's all swords and sorcery. You can engorge on magic when leveling up and make quick work of the three-legged freak known as the infiltrator if you play your cards right. I prefer the heaviest killing tools, however, coming close enough to my foes to smell their breath. You will probably not sob when your ghost expires and you leave behind all your experience. Experience can be regained easily, and in the last several hours, you accumulate too little experience from killing enemies to mind the loss. The bosses may parade around their ominous titles and roar with indignance, but most of them are more bark than bite: if you have Souls experience, many will go down on the first attempt. The challenge ramps up nicely during the lead-up to the final showdown, however, beginning with a double-boss encounter that signals trouble to come. The greatest challenge Lords of the Fallen provides isn't a welcome one: it's easy to lose yourself in the crypts and corridors, unsure of where the game means for you to go. Every region cleverly connects with others, and unlocking a new door often leads you to a familiar area, provoking cries of ""Eureka!"" That interconnectedness can also be a burden, however, particularly when a loading screen is there to interrupt your travels. Dark Souls has no quest log, yet smartly uses its visual diversity and clear environmental gating to direct you. Lords of the Fallen tells you what you must do, but some areas are so circuitous and same-ish, and some entrances so subtle, that the game can become aimless. Backtracking is sometimes required, so you may not know where the right path lies. Intriguing subtleties ultimately overcome any resulting tedium, however. You choose whether to save a man's life by amputating his arm--and then, whether to offer him a potion to help heal the wound you dealt him. Offering the potion diminishes your available (and replenishable) health draught count by one, but I was never sure if I had earned any reward for allowing him to live. Soon afterwards, I convinced a fellow warrior to spare a monk's life; I'm not sure there were any repercussions, but I was at least content to know that Harkyn was not always the vile executioner others insisted he was. Later, you get to make a more interesting life-or-death decision, and in at least one case, can circumvent danger entirely. Lords of the Fallen has a brief brush with mystery in these circumstances, inspiring ""what if"" quandaries. What if I ignore the order to request a group of deserters? What if I go around the monster rather than meet it head-on? Should there be a Lords of the Fallen 2, I hope for more what-ifs, and more-meaningful consequences to accompany them. The bosses may parade around their ominous titles and roar with indignance, but most of them are more bark than bite.   Superficially, you could call Lords of the Fallen a Souls game for the meek and the uninitiated. But it earns more respect than such a flippant description. Lords of the Fallen isn't about the game that it isn't, but the game that it is. It's about the ghoulish blacksmith, his glowing eyes, and the long tufts of stiff hair that rise from his scalp. It's about the crunches of iron against bone when your hammer finds its mark. It's about taking in new sights and sounds, and about finding new ways to travel to old ones. It's about that suspended bridge, the monuments that guard it, and the creatures waiting within. Harkyn may have no use for these places, but there are riches inside nonetheless."
2860,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,8.0,2,"   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 left off. Our heroes, Soap and Price, are in bad shape, and the villain, Makarov, is still at large. It doesn't take the pair long to get back in the hunt, and soon you're hopping the globe in pursuit of your quarry. You make a few forays into backwater outposts, but the most striking situations are when you take up arms in conflicts that consume entire cities. From New York City to London to Paris, no bastion of Western civilization is safe, and the destruction that has been visited on these iconic locations is visually stunning. The impressive scenery makes the action more impactful, and the campaign shuffles you around to different fronts within each city to make sure you can experience the battle from many different angles. Remote air support control, on-foot firefights, and tense vehicle sequences keep the campaign moving at a great clip in these urban environments, capturing the expert pacing that has made past Call of Duty campaigns so exhilarating.      As with its predecessors, the Modern Warfare 3 campaign has a few tricks up its sleeve aimed to shake you up or make you cry out with excitement. The latter are more successful than the former. A jet flight gone wrong and a chase through Parisian streets are highlights, using environmental upheaval to make you feel like you are struggling for control in an out-of-control situation. These sections are definitely exciting, but because Call of Duty has trained you to expect the unexpected, they lack the extra spark of surprise that kicks exciting up to thrilling. Modern Warfare 3 also takes a startlingly out-of-place shot at wrenching your heartstrings, but the outcome is so obvious from the moment the scene starts that you're left to watch dispassionately as the characters set up and fall victim to tragedy (opting to not see disturbing content at the outset of the campaign will likely spare you this unpleasantness). The game is more resonant when you encounter scenes of tragedy in the natural course of the campaign, but this is not an emotionally fraught campaign. It is, however, an engaging and superbly paced roller-coaster ride that brings the Modern Warfare story to a very satisfying conclusion.        If the five-hour campaign doesn't satisfy your thirst for AI blood, then the Special Ops mode almost certainly will. Returning after its debut in Modern Warfare 2, Spec Ops offers 16 one-off missions that complement the events of the campaign, letting you experience new facets of the global conflict in which you are embroiled. From stealthily escorting resistance fighters to slugging through a large enemy force in a Juggernaut suit, there's a lot of variety here. Though even the longest missions can be completed in under 10 minutes, the variable difficulty levels help Spec Ops missions provide hours' worth of challenging combat. Furthermore, you can now tackle almost every mission solo and make a bid for leaderboard glory.        Spec Ops also includes the new Survival mode, which offers even more opportunity for cooperative or solo slaughter. Survival pits you against wave after wave of increasingly difficult AI enemies on the same maps you encounter in competitive multiplayer. Playing either Survival mode or Spec Ops missions levels up your Spec Ops profile, which in turn channels that familiar satisfaction by unlocking guns, attachments, and equipment. These unlocks come into play solely during Survival games. As you progress through waves and earn money for killing enemies, you gain access to hotspots where you can purchase items from your unlocked arsenal. While you can always pick up the guns your enemies drop in a pinch, the weapons you purchase are likely to be the ones that give you staying power. Refilling grenades and ammo regularly is a necessity, and as the waves get tougher, so is making use of the more powerful assets in your repertoire. A sentry gun can help you stay safely entrenched in one corner of the map, while a squad of AI allies can help cover you when things get hairy. With good gun choices and savvy equipment use, you can make solid progress, but there's always another wave waiting to outflank and overwhelm you.        Spec Ops is a great destination for those seeking a stiff, surmountable challenge (missions) or the thrill of seeing how far sharpshooting and smarts can get you (survival). But the most fiendish challenge comes when you take your skills into the realm of online competitive multiplayer. The action will be instantly familiar to anyone who has braved a Call of Duty battlefield in the past four years. The speedy action and rewarding experience point system are just as thrilling and addictive as ever, and some welcome refinements make it even easier to enjoy. Interface improvements make it easier to customize your loadout and view relevant challenges, which offer hefty XP bonuses. Those thirsty for more information about their weapons and statistics can use the free Call of Duty Elite application, which you can download to your Xbox Dashboard or access through a Web browser. In addition to providing extensive stat breakdowns and a variety of premium features that you must pay more to access, Elite offers some useful weapon tips that can help you tweak your battlefield strategy. The Combat Training mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops that simulated a multiplayer environment with AI opponents does not appear here, so newcomers are left to fend for themselves in the online wilds (though Survival mode at least affords you the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the maps).      The 16 maps provide an excellent array of arenas for the action to play out. Bomb planting, flag grabbing, territory controlling, and straightforward killing form the backbone of most matches, with the notable new addition of Kill Confirmed. This mode mixes things up by requiring you to collect tags from dead bodies in order to actually register your kills. Confirming a kill or denying an enemy kill by collecting a downed ally's tags is as important as making sure your bullets hit the target, giving this mode an enjoyable new tactical dimension. Adjustments to weapon upgrades and killstreaks also require some tactical shifting, because you now unlock attachments, camouflage, and stat-boosting proficiencies by leveling up individual weapons through use. Killstreak rewards have been reissued in strike packages that offer some new assets to play with, like a remote recon drone and a ballistic ground-based booby trap. The Assault strike package works in the familiar way, rewarding you for killing successive enemies in a single life, but the Support strike package doesn't care if your streak spans multiple respawns, and the Specialist strike package rewards you with extra perks instead of traditional killstreak rewards.        These tweaks alter the flow of rewards into your arsenal and onto the battlefield, but Modern Warfare 3 doesn't take any chances with the tried-and-true formula. At launch, even the matchmaking playlists feature standard fare, but the robust Private Match customization options let you tweak the standards to your liking (even offering some of Black Ops' more interesting modes) and hold the possibility of odd permutations to come. Whatever diversions or innovations may lie in Modern Warfare 3's future, the competitive multiplayer still offers the same sweet satisfaction you've come to expect from the series. This is some of the best online shooter action around, and with the daunting challenges of Spec Ops and the exciting, globe-trotting campaign, Modern Warfare 3 stands tall as another great descendant of the game that changed a generation.   "
2388,Game &amp; Wario,5.0,1,"WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$! for the Game Boy Advance garnered attention and acclaim for its skewering of the minigame trend. The game featured ""microgames"" lasting only a scant few seconds, punctuated by utterly bizarre imagery and even a bit of retro flair. It was a resounding critical and commercial success, and future installments took advantage of unique features of Nintendo's platforms while still maintaining the series' frenetic pacing. However, Game &amp; Wario, the Wii U follow-up to the franchise, takes things in a different direction, and winds up becoming the uneven minigame mess that the original WarioWare poked fun at so long ago.        Game &amp; Wario is a collection of 16 minigames that make use of both the Wii U's unique GamePad controller and the TV screen. Each game is themed around one of the weird residents of Diamond City, so longtime WarioWare players can expect to see familiar faces as well as some recurring series imagery. (Some of the backgrounds contain funny in-jokes for fans, so keep your eyes peeled.) Twelve games are single-player focused, while the remaining four are multiplayer affairs. Rounding out the package is an additional Miiverse-enabled application.     While the multiplayer and Miiverse applications are available from the outset, the single-player games have to be unlocked by completing the previous game to a satisfactory degree. The games can then be replayed on various additional difficulties for score challenges and to earn extra credits to spend on unlocking extras at the Cluck-a-Pop machine. The problem is that many of the collection's best games aren't unlocked until you've cleared some of the worst of the bunch. For many of these games, once you've cleared them, you'll never feel compelled to touch them again.        The issue that many of the collection's most frustrating games have is that they ask that you use the big, bulky Wii U GamePad as a precision aiming device. Unlike the Wii Remote, the size and shape of the controller makes it difficult to focus precisely, particularly if you're asked to hold it one-handed. The very first game, Arrow (which feels much too similar to Takamaru's Ninja Castle in Nintendo Land), proves frustrating off the bat as your shots miss targets the game indicated were in your line of fire. Camera is a bit more forgiving, but it's essentially a hidden-object game that requires you to have very steady controller-holding hands in order to take clear photos of people and things in the environment.     Other games focus more on the tilt sensitivity of the GamePad with mixed results. Skiing and Bowling are basic implementations of the sports they represent with tilt controls to move or aim. Kung Fu feels like a 3D version of Doodle Jump: you use the tilt function to control where a constantly bouncing character lands. Ashley takes the titular witch on an adventure that initially looks like an interesting parody of cute Japanese arcade shooters, but turns out to simply be a slow-paced tilt-to-move collection and obstacle-avoidance game.      When the tilt sensitivity acts up in these games, it's tough to discern if the problem is you, the controller calibration, or just poor design. But there's poor design present, too--ironically, in a game called Design, where you're asked to draw shapes to very precise measurements. If you don't know exactly what a 25-degree angle or a circle with a 2.5-inch circumference looks like off the top of your head, you'll be tempted to dig out your old geometry class supplies just so you can proceed. Other minigames are just retreads: Bird, one of the final games, is the classic Pyoro bean-eating game that has appeared in almost every WarioWare title in some form. Aside from the visuals, it has barely changed from the original, which you can still buy on the DSiWare eShop.        But among these average and even outright annoying minigames are some true gems. Patchwork is a charming, relaxing puzzle game where you fit shapes into outlines to create pixel images. Gamer puts classic WarioWare-style microgames on the GamePad with an added challenge: you're playing past your bedtime, so you have to look and listen for signs of your seemingly demonic mom checking to see if you're asleep, and hide at appropriate times. The brilliant Taxi is the offspring of Crazy Taxi and a first-person shooter, with some Minecraft-inspired aesthetics thrown in. In this game, you're fighting off alien invaders with a cab-mounted bazooka on the GamePad screen, then picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destinations before a tense battle with the extraterrestrial mothership. It's a creative, fun concept that you can't help but think would be awesome if it were fleshed out as a full game.      Most of these games feel like dull, low-effort products, however, and multiplayer is similarly uneven. Islands has you launching small colonies of Fronk creatures at a target, and suffers from the same precision problems as games like Arrow, but it's still enjoyable in that you can attempt to muck things up for other players by knocking their creatures off the board. Disco is a simple two-player pattern-mimicking game where you try to copy another player's set of controller commands set to funky music. Fruit is a game where one player tries to blend into a crowd and steal fruit while avoiding detection by other players; it's a very cool concept, but too slow-paced for a party atmosphere. Finally, Sketch is the classic Pictionary concept with a bit of wacky Wario imagery tossed in for good measure.         The final bit of the package is a Miiverse-enabled sketch-sharing program and an extension of the Sketch minigame. You can suggest and download ""words"" to draw quick 60-second sketches of. You can then upload these sketches for the original word suggester to admire and (possibly) giggle at. You can also check trending words to see many images that people have drawn of popular subjects. It's a cute diversion, but hardly a game seller. (You might also encounter connection errors when uploading and downloading.)     Overall, Game &amp; Wario doesn't have the consistency or the creativity expected from the series. Seeing Wario's once-awesome microgame galleries turned into a bog-standard minigame-fest is disappointing in its own right, too. WarioWare farted in the face of conventional game design, and further installments made creative use of new control schemes without losing the pacing and craziness the original established. Game &amp; Wario, in contrast, feels like the aged former punk rocker who has got an office job now but still wants to convince the kids that he's hip and with-it. There's still some spark of that rebellious Wario genius, but for the most part, the game seems to give up and settle for stable mediocrity.    "
442,Kirby Fighters 2,6.0,1,"Kirby Fighters 2 has somewhat of an adorable identity crisis on its puffy, pink hands. It initially comes across as a gateway fighting game, an entry step even before the widely-loved Super Smash Bros. series. Approachable in both controls and tone, Kirby Fighters 2 is a mostly pleasant brawler bursting with charm. A slender content offering and some bizarre difficult spikes notwithstanding, Kirby's latest spinoff is a capable combatant.There are no stage knockouts or lives here, just a scrap until someone gets knocked out. Also, most of the characters are Kirby--well, a variety of Kirbys equipped with different copy abilities, alongside some other familiar characters who aren't Kirby to round out the roster. Among the pink puffballs of pain are series classics such as the Link-wannabe Sword Kirby, Artist Kirby who draws minions to cause damage, and Bomb Kirby, who does exactly what you think. My personal favourite is Wrestler Kirby, thanks to his stylish little lucha libre-inspired mask and utterly brutal throws.One of Kirby Fighters 2's strengths is how easy it is to jump in and start belting the tar out of cute characters. Between jumping, attacking, and inhaling, you'll only need to get your head around three buttons for attacking and a fourth for blocking. Kirby's range of identities provide a surprising amount of variety, with characters such as Fighter Kirby suited to close-quarters combat and Yo-Yo Kirby adept at keeping foes at a distance. Each Kirby wields unique combos and attacks and each is relatively simple to learn--most only need a combination of a single button press paired with a directional input.Compared to other fighting games, everything about Kirby Fighters 2 is compact--the stages are small, fights are quick, and the moment-to-moment gameplay is tightly confined. Each stage conjures up a different obstacle or quirk to navigate, including a runaway train, lava pillars, and enemies who don't discriminate against who they attack. Because of the tightly crafted nature of these stages, there's just enough room to dodge obstacles and opponents' attacks, while always keeping you involved in the combat and reducing any potential lulls in the action. Additionally, Kirby Fighters 2's revival mechanic means you're always in with a chance of winning--getting knocked out turns you into a ghost, at which point you can try and land a hit to return to the fight with a sliver of HP--as long as your teammate is still conscious or at least one character is still standing in a free-for-all bout. While you can disable revivals, it's entertaining and chaotic knowing everyone has a chance to win until all foes are KO'd. Most importantly, in team fights, characters on the same side can smooch to recover HP in battle--just like in real life.Kirby Fighters 2's story mode is a more uneven experience. This mode sees you play as a Kirby of your choosing alongside either a second player or a reasonably intelligent AI partner, ascending a tower to lay the smackdown on King Dedede and Meta Knight. Even by Kirby game standards, the plot here is thin, told through slides of text to provide a bare minimum amount of context before fighting floors of enemies. Between each successive battle, upgrades can be equipped before each fight to increase health or attack power, while some enhance the effectiveness of restorative pickups or augment your damage output against bosses. It's an interesting system that adds a gentle layer of strategy in between fights, but it can lead to frustration during later chapters, namely during boss fights.The boss fights in Kirby Fighters 2's remove much of what makes combat so dynamic. When pit against adversaries your own size, fights are more kinetically responsive, as grapples and special moves cause interruptions, while battling the big boss brutes is like hitting a static punching bag with a health bar. They move around and unleash moves that keep you on your feet, but the push-and-pull elements that make combat interesting are significantly reduced here. The difficulty of these bosses is predominantly linked to their exorbitant amount of health and a restrictive time limit to beat them in. Only by having a certain set of upgrades do you stand a chance, something that is significantly less important in all other fights. Having to overcome bosses who act as annoying difficulty spikes is a maddening decision that betrays the happy-go-lucky nature of Kirby games.The final story mode chapter stands out as Kirby Fighters 2's most baffling design choice. All previous chapters allow you to retry after any defeat at the cost of some points towards your end score. However, the 50-floor final chapter slaps on a three-retry limit completely out of the blue. This wouldn't be nearly as frustrating if it had been playing to this rule all along and setting your expectations accordingly. I managed to beat the final chapter in a dramatic last-retry fashion, but I spent most of the last few floors lamenting how I'd have to start from scratch if I made any errors instead of actually enjoying the challenge. Aside from the story, there aren't many compelling modes for longer play sessions. The lightweight Single-Handed mode sees you fight to complete waves of battles as quickly as possible. Other than this, you can play up to four-player battles with or against others locally on the same system or via local wireless connection. Unfortunately, not much in the way of interesting customization is available for these modes, just the tweaking of parameters such as items and hazards. Online multiplayer is also barren at the time of writing, with battles against random players restricted to two-on-two, while slightly more flexibility is allowed for online friend battles. I played a few rounds against a friend online and was pleased with how smooth the connection was, but there weren't any other avenues to mix things up once we were ready to move on. If you're going to play Kirby Fighters 2's multiplayer, doing so on the same system is your best bet--at least then you and another person can play story mode together too.One method Kirby Fighters 2 uses to try and hold interest is the Fighters Rank system. Every battle across all game modes nets you points towards increasing this rank, with rewards tied to each tier. Rewards include extra playable Kirby fighters, additional stages to choose from, more powerful story mode upgrades, and stylish hats to jazz up your Kirby. For a while, it's nice continually unlocking goodies just for playing, but with a few exceptions, it doesn't really inspire you to engage with all the game modes in interesting ways. For example, unlocking every playable character happens quickly just by playing story mode, but there's no incentive to try and improve your performance or replay with different characters. With each subsequent Fighters Rank, the points requirement increases, which makes unlocking later rewards a grind--especially considering the diminishing attractiveness of the upcoming rewards.Visually, Kirby Fighters 2 is a beautiful game. It perfectly captures the whimsical and kaleidoscopic heart of the Kirby series, bursting with color and personality. Plenty of stages not only pay homage to Kirby's previous adventures with recreations of iconic settings, but also include additional flourishes to transport you back to that era. These flourishes include mixing 8-bit and 16-bit graphical touches alongside 3D renders on stages such as Butter Building and Gourmet Go Go, where the stylized environment or character sprites pop alongside the modern visuals. Or the likes of Coo's Forest, which looks like you're playing in front of a freshly drawn-on easel--there are so many wonderful details to absorb. Even the bold Smash-like menus are adorned with gorgeous artwork at every step. Of course, this is all backed up by an equally delightful soundtrack, and hearing reimagined classics like Gourmet Race and King Dedede's Theme is always a joy.Comprehensively adorable and approachable, Kirby Fighters 2 is a solid entry point into the fighting genre. It's phenomenally beautiful and plays tightly, but the story's difficulty spikes and limited game modes see Kirby's latest outing falling short of stardom."
3422,Rugby League Live,4.0,0,"      While attack can provide some exciting moments, switching over to defense exposes the game's biggest failings. Guiding players in for tackles is frustrating at most times, thanks to imprecise controls that make it feel like you're navigating floaty ice skaters as opposed to barrel-chested rugby league players. You press a button to tackle (either a normal or powerful hit), but accurately moving your chosen player to the ball carrier in the first place is a big chore. You find yourself harmlessly running past players instead of directly at them, and this situation is made even worse by Rugby League Live's unreliable and unresponsive player switching controls. Pressing the button to switch to the player closest to the ball often does no such thing; instead, it picks someone away from the ball carrier or, worse still, doesn't switch at all.         Things don't get much better when it comes to gameplay modes, with Rugby League Live's list of play options looking positively bare compared to most other sports games. Offline, you can play quick matches or one full season, and that's it. There's no option to play through multiple seasons and no franchise mode; there isn't even a practice or training mode for newcomers to the sport. The game does feature the ability to create custom players, teams, and seasons, but these are similarly stripped back. You have a few preset looks to choose from when creating a player, and their stats and abilities don't improve once they're on the field. As for teams, you choose a logo and a team uniform. But if you wanted to edit existing real-life teams (to transfer players, for example), you're out of luck because the game locks you out of making any changes from any of its rosters. As for multiplayer, Rugby League Live supports up to four people in offline and online multiplayer. Offline can be engaging in short bursts with a group of sports fans, while online matches generally ran smoothly during testing (although finding opponents online proved to be challenging).      Like a battle-weary league player who's taken too many head-high hits, Rugby League Live isn't a pretty game to look at. The game features plenty of low-quality player models, muddy textures, and downright clunky animations. The players all look to be made from only a few preset character models (all tree-trunk thighs and no necks), while their likenesses to their real-world counterparts are often tough to spot. There are more than 30 real stadiums re-created in Rugby League Live, but the crowds within them are a flat, 2D blurs. Of the two consoles, the Xbox 360 version comes out looking sharper, thanks to better antialiasing, but neither really impresses. In-game commentary is provided by Australian Channel Nine broadcaster Andrew Voss, and while he does a generally good job of conveying excitement, you'll hear the same phrases repeated ad nauseam, often numerous times within one match.     "
1586,Dirty Bomb,5.0,1,"In Dirty Bomb, ruined London streets and abandoned train stations play host to multiplayer skirmishes where teams fight to complete objectives amid a hail of white-hot gunfire. It's a twitch shooter at its most extreme: an arena of quick kills, high energy, and tired pinky fingers mashing down the sprint key. This fire-from-the-hip shooter arms you with shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, and, fittingly enough given the ongoing motifs, a cricket bat. Unfortunately, a lack of fresh ideas keeps the game from being memorable, while some bothersome glitches and lag stifle your enjoyment. The formula is a recognizable one. In fact, if you're well-versed in shooters, you can spot where Dirty Bomb derives its influence. There are ingredients from Counter-Strike, Team Fortress 2, Call of Duty, and, of course, developer Splash Damage's own shooter Brink; it's a melting pot of good ideas from the past. These all too familiar elements, however, prevent Dirty Bomb from defining its own identity and standing out among the crowd of its brethren. Even its name sounds like the last to survive a whiteboard list of slashed, rejected titles. But it's not as if the game isn't fun to play. It's fast and frantic, it looks great, and the running, jumping, and shooting elements have an excellent tactile fluidity that makes the high-speed combat instantly accessible and able to entertain for hours. Beyond that, however, it just doesn't do anything special. There is a shred of Brink's spirit still alive within Dirty Bomb: a freedom of movement, heavily toned down. Though made by the same creator, the two games aren't really siblings--more like cousins that used to jump over chest-high walls in their youth. The free running, however, has diminished to hopping off walls, either to adjust your movement angle or to reach higher ledges. And that's actually just about it. The maps do a fine job of supporting wall bouncing, though. Stairs descending at a sharp angle can be bypassed with speed by jumping and giving the elbow a swift kick, propelling you forward. Small ledges in many games have to be circumvented by foot, but Dirty Bomb encourages you to embrace speed, allowing you to bounce from a wall to a new plateau while still moving at a vigorous pace. Dirty Bomb is all about completing objectives. As the advancing team, your job is to plant C4 on targets, open doors and gates, or protect and transport an EV--an armored tank-like vehicle--to a specific location, all within a given time limit. On the other side, your enemies do everything they can to keep you from advancing. After the first round, the match enters a short intermission where the teams swap sides, switching from defense to offense and vice versa. You can also play stopwatch, which is objective mode except that the team that accomplishes its goals faster is declared the winner. A separate competitive stopwatch mode adds party options and assigns a rank. It also takes the word ""competitive"" seriously. Before you join, you must agree that you will not leave or you will receive a punishment. Yes, a punishment. You are locked into a match, and simply quitting isn't quite so simple. Returning to the main menu, you are asked to resume the match in play. If you choose not to, the game automatically quits to desktop so you can think about what you've done. Booting the game back up, you are asked once more to rejoin the match. Choosing no again closes the game. If you are persistent, you face getting dealt with a short, temporary ban from playing the competitive mode. Having players locked into the match does create other issues. From my experience, those who quit (and mean it) leave the match unbalanced. At times, they return to finish the fight, but that was uncommon in my many hours of competitive matchmaking. This left me in an awkward four-on-five, or worse, five-on-two, player match, as my remaining team received a punishment of a different kind: the one where you spend the remainder of the game getting pathetically slaughtered by overwhelming odds. Choosing to not accept a match invite will also result in a short ban--for me, only around two minutes. Twelve distinct mercenaries make up Dirty Bomb's cast, many of which fall into the typical shooter roles. You have the run-of-the-mill soldier and support classes, as well as a hooded sniper, a swift-footed engineer, and medics. Only a smattering of mercenaries is available at the start, while a few others are temporarily unlocked in a weekly rotation. If you find a mercenary you like, you can unlock it for upwards of 50,000 in-game credits or, as this is a free-to-play game, for a fee of $9.99. Both options, however, are a tad steep. Each finished match usually awards you with several hundred credits, so it will take many hours to earn enough to buy a single mercenary. The system is slow, and over time it can make the real-world cash option seem more reasonable. Occasional weekend events that award double experience points and credits do help, but you're still looking at a serious time investment. Another option is to drop some cash on a temporary credit booster that doubles your earned credits following each match, but that won't help if you don't plan on forking over any of the green. Mercenaries are paired with loadout cards that, depending on rarity, offer divergent sets of primary and secondary weapons. They also come with up to three mercenary-specific augmentations--the amount changes with card rarity--that offer status boosts such as decreased reload speed or healing cooldown. New loadouts for your mercenaries are unlocked via cases, awarded randomly as you play. There are six forms of rarity with the cards, starting at the most common form of lead, then iron, bronze, silver, gold, and the ultra-rare cobalt. In my experience, most of the time you will unlock lead cards, but every so often, as luck ordains, you can walk away with silver card or even higher. Dirty Bomb, however, does allow you to transmute lead into gold without it costing an arm or a leg. You stock up a hefty supply of lead cards the longer you play, but they're far from completely worthless. For several cards and a small fee of credits, you can trade the garbage cards for ones with a little more glimmer, and you can do so for a specific mercenary. The entire system, trade-ups included, is based on chance, so even if you trade for a rarer card, you still may not get the loadout you desire--so expect to spend a lot of time collecting cards. You can trade credits and cash for specific loadout cards, but, much like the pricey mercenaries, they do not come cheap. Succeeding in a Dirty Bomb match requires strong team cohesion. The maps are designed to support bottlenecks and choke points, all of which can be exploited by the defense. Experience will tell you where on the maps the best placements for healing stations, mines, or turrets are, as well as the best class for the job. Having a team comprising mostly soldiers will help rack up the kills, but without medics things go awry fast. If you do find yourself in such a situation, never fret. Before the match begins and during the death screen, you can choose to jump in as a different mercenary from a squad of three that you build in the main menu. Keeping up communication, such as asking for someone to switch classes in order to create a stronger fortification or offensive push, helps maintain a stronger team as the match advances. Your best bet for consistent enjoyment is to run with a team. If that isn't an option, then you can help move the team in the right direction using the in-game microphone. Dirty Bomb moves at a brisk stride, but can't help making a few awkward stumbles. Expect the game to occasionally freeze, crash, and kick you from matches--all three could cause you to earn a punishment if you don't return to a competitive match quickly enough. These problems, while annoying, are thankfully rare, especially compared to the far more frequent problem regarding lag. And I don't just mean the slight, second-long delays in the menu--which is also irritating. While playing, some shots that clearly miss can somehow strike a target, while bullets from your enemies can still find your fleshy posterior even as you round a corner into safety. More than once, while in the death screen, I saw the stationary ghostly figure of my attacker, and his or her shot going through a wall and striking my opaque mercenary in the back--leaving me to scratch my chin and sigh as I waited to respawn. It isn't necessarily abysmal or game-breaking, but if you're a competitive-shooting stickler like me, you will become increasingly aggravated as the game's lag-charged issues become more obvious the longer you play. These are not new problems, either. Skimming through the game's forums, it appears that lag and other server woes have defined the Dirty Bomb's development for some time. From what I gather, the game does perform better now than it has in the past, but the road to stability continues to stretch onward. The game would also benefit from more varied maps and game modes. In its current version, there are only a handful of stages to play on, and with modes that range from objective or, well, faster objective, the game does eventually stray into tedium. There is a team deathmatch on its way, which might curb the monotony. Defined by its predecessors, Dirty Bomb straddles the divide between old and new, never quite able to step out of the shadows of the games that came before. Still, if you're looking for a decent multiplayer shooter on the very cheap, Dirty Bomb is a fast-paced possibility. However, I'm not confident that the core will improve enough for the game to reach beyond merely ordinary. While Brink sits in history as a game that tripped on its path to fame, Dirty Bomb will be fortunate to be remembered at all. Editor’s Note: On May 29th, 2015, we received notice from a public relations firm representing Dirty Bomb publisher Nexon that the game would be entering its open beta period starting June 7, 2015. The email invited us to review Dirty Bomb based on that period, calling the open beta “effectively the full launch of the game.” Accordingly, we published a full review of Dirty Bomb. Since the review was published, Nexon has contacted us directly to let us know that the open beta is not actually considered a full, reviewable release, and that several more features are planned for the period before final release. These features include match reports, additional skins, more mercs, private matches, Execution mode, spectator mode, casual matchmaking, and at least one more map. For news on recent updates to Dirty Bomb, we recommend visiting the game’s official site. GameSpot is happy to note these upcoming features in this editor’s note. However, we also recognize the potential for abuse in informing a publication that a game is ready for review, and then contradicting this information once the review has been published. Thusly, our review of Dirty Bomb will remain published as written. - KV, 6/26/2015"
474,Risk of Rain 2,8.0,2,"As we prepared to take on Risk of Rain 2's final boss, we took a moment to take stock of our Survivors. My co-op partner had three syringes filled with glowing green slime jutting out of his hip, a sword at his side and a crown on his head. A leech was suctioned onto my head, a teddy bear stuck to my shoulder and John Lennon glasses stretched around the front of my domed helmet. Each of these baubles represented a perk we had acquired over the course of our headlong rush to the final boss. This is the kind of game Risk of Rain 2 is. At the end of a run, you can see every advantage that you have collected, all hanging off of your once-simple character model like fuzzy dice on a car mirror.And, as it launches into 1.0, Hopoo Games' third-person shooter roguelike has a year-and-a-half of early access in its rearview. I didn't play the game during pre-release, so I can't testify to how much content this version adds to what was already there. But I can say that Risk of Rain 2 is a breakneck experience that builds and builds and builds. This is not a game of peaks and valleys. Risk of Rain 2 is all climb until you reach the summit. That's its greatest strength--and its only real notable weakness.Each run begins with your Survivor emerging from an escape pod onto a hostile alien world. This landscape is largely empty. Lo-fi music plays. It's generally pretty chill and evocative for the first few seconds. But then you're assaulted by a horde of low-level creatures. At the top right corner of the screen, a meter slowly moves right, upping the difficulty from Easy to Medium to Hard (and up and up and up until the difficulty bar just reads ""HAHAHAHAHA"") as a run progresses. Each level ends when you find and activate a teleporter, summoning a boss monster, which you must defeat to use the portal. In between entrance and exodus, Risk of Rain 2's world is full of interesting decisions and secrets. You may want to sacrifice half your health at the Altar of Blood for rewards down the line. Or you might summon double the boss monsters for a shot at double rewards. Get lost long enough in your search for the teleporter and you may find an underground passage where you can find a hidden code etched on a tablet, which can be used to access a secret realm. As you explore, the world is gradually filling up with enemies; the music is, smartly, slowly building to an all-out guitar-wailing crescendo.That difficulty slider never stops ticking up, so it's in your best interest to find and defeat each boss as soon as possible. The catch is that if you run headlong into a boss fight, you're likely to get stomped. Each boss is a bullet sponge on its own, and the standard enemies don't stop attacking just because you're in a boss fight. To turn the tables in your favor, you need to kill enemies to collect money, then take that money to the various crates that litter each level for an unlockable boon.This is where Risk of Rain 2 is at its fascinating best. As in most roguelikes, each run is the process of creating a build and leaning into different strengths and weaknesses as you progress. So, if you want to transform the glass cannon Huntress into a non-glass cannon, you can buy and equip healing perks that help to shore up the class' defensive deficiencies. Or, you could go all-in on offense, collecting damage modifiers until you're taking boss monsters out in a matter of seconds.Unlike other roguelikes, Risk of Rain 2 doesn't require many sacrificial choices. In similar games, I frequently find myself doing cost-benefit analysis upon finding a new weapon. Should I swap out the slow, but powerful Broadsword, in favor of the Blood Sword, which will leave my enemies bleeding out? But, in Risk of Rain 2, your core weapons never change.You will, at times, need to decide what special attack you want equipped. But, the majority of the upgrades you pick up along the way are additive. The nuances of your build are determined by the perks you pick up along the way. And, gloriously, everything stacks. So, a perk that causes enemies to suffer bleed damage can stack on top of a perk that causes fire damage, reducing your enemies into a bloody, burning mess of flying damage numbers. Or you could buy two bleed perks and watch the numbers bounce off at twice the rate.This makes the shooting here substantially more engaging than it would be otherwise. Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelike first and foremost, but its third-person shooting wouldn't feel out of place in a loot-shooter. Boss opponents here require an armory's ammo to take down. Normal enemies similarly can absorb a full clip before expiring, and their animations don't really betray the damage they're taking. Or, at least, if they do, they're covered up by the flashy numbers that fly off enemy bodies like fireworks. I was generally unimpressed by the act of pulling the trigger.What makes Risk of Rain 2 interesting is the way that your choices affect what the shooting does. In addition to the process of stacking perk on top of perk until your build sways like a late-game Jenga tower, there are other choices to make during a run and before it even starts. Initially, you only have access to the Commando, a bubble-helmeted space warrior, with a stable (if unremarkable) pistol, a burst fire ability and a powerful plasma shot. This Commando is a solid all-rounder. On the other hand, MUL-T, a bulky robot you unlock after playing five runs, has a massive health bar and painfully slow default movement speed. I say ""default movement speed"" because he can pull his metal limbs into his boxy body and boost into enemies like a dumpster speeding down a mountain. There's a substantial roster of Survivors, and so far I've only unlocked a little over half. I've learned the basics of their skillsets, but the prospect of learning to master their skills and synergies is exciting.That variety is echoed in the roster of enemies. The act of shooting can be a little dull, as you take on bullet-sponge after bullet-sponge. But, the diversity of enemy size, movement and abilities helps keep combat fresh. You're frequently switching between different abilities as you're confronted by different monsters. I often used the Commando's burst fire to take out the fiery eggs that fly over your head like a flock of angry, spherical sea gulls. And, when I got swamped by enemies as MUL-T, I could launch a bomb into the crowd, then use my boost to barrel through them like a bowling ball. The variety of enemies is smartly complemented by the variety of each Survivor's base skills.The game's greatest asset is also its greatest weakness. As you progress through the difficulty ranks, enemies begin to spawn with ridiculous regularity. At certain points, they can mob and destroy you easily, biting huge chunks out of your health bar at a time. So, staying alive requires constant vigilance. Runs can often last for an hour or longer. While other roguelikes include a brief respite between missions during which you can buy upgrades and tinker with your build, the only break you'll get in Risk of Rain 2 is the brief load that separates one hostile alien world from another. Other than that, you can sleep when you're dead. It all contributes to a game that feels like it never stops crescendoing. And that's exciting! But it also meant that I often felt spent after a single run. There is no real rest to be found here.Risk of Rain 2 is lo-fi beats to relax to with the bass boosted until the subwoofers catch fire. And explode. And bleed? What begins as a chill loot-shooty time quickly escalates to a frantic fight for your life where everything is burning and there's a big red target on your back. The lack of any strategic layer between the action did leave me feeling burned out. But the additive nature of the game's builds give Risk of Rain 2 the feeling of a pebble skittering along a rocky cliff. When the avalanche begins, enemies would be well advised to get out of your way."
956,Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,8.0,2,"Fast-forward nine years, and Bandai Namco has successfully rejuvenated Pac-Man once again in Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2. It’s so overhauled, in fact, that it uses a progression meter to unlock new modes--starting with a tutorial. Who’d have thought that a Pac-Man game would need instructions? Yet Championship Edition 2 definitely does. Rather than merely teach you how to play, it also serves as a quick trip down the road of game design to see how developers can successfully evolve a game from 1980.The first major enhancement comes courtesy of Pac-Man’s relationship with the ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Pac-Man can touch them now, after decades of doing his best to avoid making contact. Even though you won't outright die if you bump into a ghost, it can still have dangerous side effects--and after the third bump, the ghosts will doggedly chase down Pac-Man and kill him on contact.The game includes sleeping ghosts as well, who wake up when Pac-Man gets near and immediately rush to join their leader. The veritable trains that form after waking up multiple ghosts are vital for achieving high scores, because when Pac-Man eats the power pill that allows him to devour weakened spirits, he can gobble up multiple ghosts in quick succession. When it's time to feast on the dead, the game switches to a cinematic 3D view, allowing you revel in your success in style.Boss battles are also included now--but done in proper Pac-Man style. You don’t attack a boss directly, since they float above and below the board (they’re usually massive ghosts made up of hundreds of blocks). Instead, you fight through a series of maps by collecting every last piece of fruit. On the final stage, Pac-Man must eat enough dots to make a power pill appear. The resulting mayhem isn’t quite as interactive as it could be--the power pill merely kicks off a cutscene where Pac-Man devours the boss on his own.The final twists are bombs and bomb jumps. Essentially, if Pac-Man gets himself into a tight spot, a quick button press will send him back to his starting point. This is important, because Pac must tactically change course sometimes in order to evade ghosts or catch floating fruit that runs away from him.The first Championship Edition was a triumph of style, and the same can be said here. The classic Pac-Man theme is present and accounted for--remixed and enhanced like everything else--and the overall presentation is terrific. All these elements come together across the game's many levels to create an experience that’s still absolutely Pac-Man but advanced in ways that make it far more interesting and strategic. Beyond that, this is the same great game it was on the other consoles with the same great visuals and gameplay. - Jason D'Aprile, Feb. 24, 11:00 AM PT "
264,Halo Infinite,9.0,2,"Halo Infinite is the first time we've seen that kind of relationship dynamic flipped. Paired with a new AI, simply named ""the Weapon,"" Chief takes on a more fatherly figure in Infinite. Where Cortana was assertive, quick-witted, and mature, the Weapon is awkward, overly trusting, and silly. She sounds and acts like a child-like version of Cortana, pushing Chief into taking on a more domineering role that has far greater control over her. This opens some intriguing new opportunities for a Halo story--in a franchise that has long had an undercurrent theme of familial connection and motherhood, Infinite is the first in the series to focus its narrative around familial responsibility and fatherhood. The strength of that narrative, alongside the open world and new traversal mechanics, delivers a welcoming freshness to the two-decade-old series.Other than Chief, Halo Infinite doesn't have much in the way of familiar faces. Very early into the campaign, you're confronted with the startling reveal that a lot of the folks you've come to know over Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Wars 2 are dead or missing in action. Chief finds himself on a new Halo ring named Zeta Halo, which has been partially destroyed. The Banished, an independent army of multiple alien species that splintered off the Covenant, want the ring for some unknown purpose, and Chief vows to stop them. Without any of his usual allies to turn to, Chief ropes two unwitting companions into his fight--the aforementioned Weapon, who was supposed to delete herself following completion of her purpose, and the Pilot, a man desperately trying to just get home to United Nations Space Command (UNSC) space after being stranded all alone for months.The first half of Act 1 and most of Act 3 are traditional Halo: contained, linear levels where you're guided through gauntlets of enemies. The rest of the game incorporates a hybrid open world. You're able to freely move through a wide open area and pursue optional side missions, or beeline for the next main story objective. Reaching those objectives typically funnels you back into the more traditional Halo level design, only for Chief to emerge into the open world again once the mission is complete.In this way, Infinite maintains the cinematic quality of Halo's traditionally linear campaigns while also incorporating an open world to explore. Those optional side missions bring aspects of Halo's multiplayer into Infinite's campaign, creating scenarios in which players can approach a problem in numerous ways, each of which can lead to satisfying and occasionally hilarious outcomes. For example, a base that needs storming can be charged into on foot; you could take out enemies stealthily with a sniper rifle from afar before approaching; or just go for broke and crash a Banshee into the base, eject at the last minute, and pull out a shotgun to clean up any remaining resistance. Experimentation is often rewarded with satisfying victory or a story of how everything went hilariously wrong. Regardless of the approach taken, it's fun to dismantle the Banished's encampments on Zeta Halo, wrestling control away from them slowly but surely.Even on Infinite's harder difficulties, you can easily skip over all the optional missions and still get that linear Halo experience if you want, but Infinite provides compelling reasons for stepping off the main path. In a first for a Halo campaign, there's an in-game progression system. Completing tasks like saving captured UNSC soldiers and destroying Banished roadblocks or refineries nets you Valor, which unlocks new vehicles and weapons that can be summoned at Forward Operating Bases across the map, allowing you to bring your favorite loadouts into future side-quests and story missions. You can also find Spartan Cores, which are spent to upgrade Chief's equipment. Perhaps my favorite upgrade is an electrified current for Halo's version of a grappling hook, the Grappleshot. This upgrade allows Chief to stun enemies by latching onto them, leaving them defenseless against a satisfyingly hard-hitting follow-up melee strike.From a gameplay perspective, the Grappleshot is the true star of Infinite's campaign. Though there are plenty of firearms, melee weapons, and grenades for Chief to use--and each tears through enemies with a nice kinetic, plasma, or electrical punch--the Grappleshot fundamentally changes how you play a Halo game for the better. In terms of traversal, a grappling hook makes Chief more nimble and opens up new vertical pathways while exploring Zeta Halo. But the tool is far more valuable in combat, allowing you to grab far-off firearms when your current one runs out of bullets, pull you into range so that Chief can land some solid hits with a shotgun or Gravity Hammer, or simply get you the heck out of dodge if things get too hot. It opens up brand-new strategies for handling old enemies too. For instance, nimble Elites can be slowed down by grabbing them with the Grappleshot, and shield-bearing Jackals will momentarily drop their guard if you grapple and pull at their shields.The Grappleshot makes Chief a faster and more efficient killer. You're still doing the same loop of gunfire, grenades, and melee, and the dance of using your shield to tank hits and taking cover when said shield is broken is still the same too, but Chief can storm through enemies far more efficiently now, adding a dynamism and more strategic considerations to the tried-and-true formula. With the Grappleshot, it becomes possible to quickly flank enemies, grab new guns, or launch back into the fight. Chief just feels faster and more deadly--it's so rewarding to pull off incredible plays with the Grappleshot, especially since its fast cooldown time means you can use it repeatedly. And since Chief starts the game with the Grappleshot in his arsenal, you get plenty of practice with it by the time you actually reach Zeta Halo and walk into Infinite's open world. The game does a good job of ensuring that using the Grappleshot is as natural as shooting or sliding.Chief's remaining equipment doesn't quite reach the same highs as the Grappleshot, but the various tools are still valuable in combat, each in their own way. Enemies hit Chief hard in the Heroic and Legendary difficulties, and mastering how to use all of his equipment opens up new means of taking them on and surviving. Oftentimes, it can feel like Infinite is actively discouraging you from engaging with the other equipment though. The Grappleshot is unbelievably useful in practically every situation, and you have to temporarily switch away from it with the D-pad to use Chief's other equipment--not an easy input to use while sprinting, jumping, shooting, and sliding your way through a hectic firefight. This does lessen the impact of unlocking a new ability, as it's hard to get excited over new equipment when I know I'm likely only going to use it a few times so that I can keep the Grappleshot always at the ready in my fight against the Banished.Less interesting than the Grappleshot is the principal antagonist, a Brute named Escharum who acts as the war chief of the Banished. The dude's got an incredible ""I am clearly the bad guy"" voice that reverberates with a growling rumble whenever he monologues, but his motivations don't really extend beyond being the leader of a group of bloodthirsty killers. Prior to the events of Infinite, Escharum waged a six-month war that saw him psychologically and physically dismantle the UNSC's soldiers and Spartans, but none of that Escharum is present in Infinite. He's described as this devastatingly brutal leader who humans fear, but we see none of that nuance in the game. There's a brief hint that the Brute has become desperate for a warrior's death and wants Chief to face him so that he can have it, but it's introduced in the story too late to make him a meaningful villain worth caring about.Instead, the intriguing characterization is reserved for Chief, the Weapon, and the Pilot. The trio form a family unit, with Chief at the head. This setup affords some incredible insight into Chief's psyche, as the armored warrior is confronted with two allies who aren't career soldiers. A truly incredible scene partway through the game sees the Pilot and Chief confront each other and what follows is a rare moment of vulnerability that humanizes Chief in an unexpected and meaningful way. Scenes like this are sprinkled throughout the campaign, as Chief, the Pilot, and the Weapon all confront their own humanity and their innate responsibility to each other as (admittedly very different) human consciousnesses.One moment in particular, however, does not land. Partway through Infinite, Chief takes away the Weapon's agency in a problematic way. The Weapon is understandably upset at the betrayal and lashes out at Chief's callous actions, only for her to quickly soften and forgive him upon learning his motivations. It feels like a rushed development, and one that unfortunately implies that, if they have a good reason, dads have a responsibility to decide a child's entire life the second said child steps out of line. The whole thing isn't resolved in a great way.While the quality of writing may occasionally dip, each key scene is bolstered by Infinite's superb soundtrack. The nature of the hybrid open world means that most of Infinite's major story beats and the conversations between characters occur in set locations, and so the orchestral score can be carefully timed with the game's most poignant moments. There has yet to be a mainline Halo game with anything less than an absolute banger of a musical score, and Infinite does not buck that trend. The rich score is helped along by the equally impressive level of detail 343 Industries has achieved with facial expressions (at least on Xbox Series X). Having a rousing score accompanied by believable acting and expressions means there is a collection of genuinely epic and tragic moments in Infinite that really land.You can also take a break from Chief and company by heading into the Academy, which introduces Halo Infinite's multiplayer and how the UNSC are training a new batch of Spartan IVs in the wake of Chief's disappearance at the start of the campaign. Alongside a detailed tutorial on the controls for Infinite, the Academy includes a number of well-made weapon drills, providing an approachable means of testing out each firearm in the game without having to worry about something shooting back at you, creating an ideal space for learning more about what each weapon does. It's a good addition, especially since it's not especially apparent what the secondary effects of some of Infinite's new firearms (like the Disruptor and Cindershot) are.The Academy is available in Halo Infinite's separate free-to-play online multiplayer as well. For my full thoughts on the game's online multiplayer, check out GameSpot's Halo Infinite multiplayer review in progress.Halo Infinite strives to transform what it means to be a Halo game, making Chief into a reluctant father figure for a young and naive AI and putting him into an open-world setting. It turns out that was a risk worth taking for the franchise, as Infinite is an incredible game. Certain story elements are on the weaker side and the amazing Grappleshot makes the rest of Chief's equipment feel a bit lacking in comparison, but these are small shortcomings in what otherwise feels like the best Halo campaign in years and an excellent evolution of what Halo can be."
4081,The Sacred Rings,4.0,0,"  More of a rehashing of Aura: Fate of the Ages than a sequel, The Sacred Rings is yet another Myst knockoff aimed solely at adventure gamers with a high tolerance for frustration. This Streko-Graphics game is deeply difficult and overflowing with excruciatingly obtuse puzzles based on the same sort of surreal contraptions that were introduced by Atreus back in 1995. However, like its predecessor, and unlike much of the Myst series, The Sacred Rings lacks a well-developed plot and interesting characters, which makes it tough to summon up much enthusiasm for trudging through this airless collection of brainteasers.        For what it's worth, the plot picks up right where Aura ended. Apprentice Umang of the Clan of Keepers awakens in a strange, apparently movable house in possession of the sacred rings that solving a lot of weird mechanical puzzles led him to in the last game. However, his quest remains unfinished, as a group of rebellious Keepers headed up by the evil Durad have started a revolt to try and grab the rings and the two pieces of the Tetrahedron artifact, which can be used together to grant great powers to their bearers. Soon you're off on another scavenger hunt through new surreal dimensions with a lot of locked doors and bizarre gadgets.     It's hard to tell up from down in The Sacred Rings, as Streko-Graphics has again given characterization and story little attention. Much of the plot is developed in grainy cutscenes, complete with stereotypical characters and a villain who actually ""Muhahahahaha!""s about your plight at one point. You spend all of your time exploring a handful of locales trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing, so you have no time for idle chit-chat. The game's visuals are good in a 1999 sort of way, and they establish an intriguing setting by being imaginative, although they are also both claustrophobic and seriously dated by a reliance on Myst's one-step-at-a-time movement. And while the impressive voice acting makes characters come to life (especially Umang), there is little of it because your interactions with human beings are few and far between.     So it's really all about the puzzles. And make no mistake, The Sacred Rings boasts an impressive collection of out-there challenges geared to test your reasoning and your sanity. There is a fairly wide variety as well, although each usually comes down to scrounging for clues and then pushing buttons, turning gears, or activating something similarly mechanical. Most deal with glyphs, colors, or some other geometric patterns and shapes that have to be dialed up or plugged into a machine (although you do get tossed the odd curveball, like in one instance where you have to examine the patterns presented by partially burned candles), so it feels like you're breaking one code after another. All are extremely hard, which leads to some satisfying ""Aha!"" moments where everything finally clicks and a solution comes to your mind.     Still, just as with Aura, Streko-Graphics doesn't provide enough context for your puzzle solving. Not only is the game missing the backdrop of a satisfying story, but it's also missing even the barest of motivations. You're typically plopped down in some whacked-out garden or a metal building with more sealed hatchways than a submarine and abandoned with nary a clue of what to do or how to go about doing it. Right at the very start of the game, you wake up in a strange house with a weirdo who tells you only to find a way to open a stuck metal door, before he goes off and takes a nap. You aren't even informed which of the house's many doors he's referring to before he goes beddy-bye. Clues are provided through notes and letters, although they're typically so mysterious and/or wordy that they could be considered puzzles all on their lonesome.        Exploration is very tedious, both due to the step-by-step movement and a need to scroll your cursor around to carefully examine every object on the screen. The latter is particularly annoying, because it feels clunky and because areas are loaded with fine details that make it impossible to tell what's useful and what's not. You come across a desk loaded with books and odd-looking paraphernalia, yet only one item is accessible. A shelf features three locked cabinets, yet only one of them can be opened. And so on. It's nice from a visual perspective that the developers took the time to dress up the game's varied environments, but there are way too many red herrings here, which makes it very easy to overlook vital objects and clues.     You need to be a hardcore puzzle-solving adventurer to get any entertainment out of The Sacred Rings. While the game features some truly devilish mysteries that provide no small sense of accomplishment when solved, don't expect to get through this one without checking out an online walk-through...or tearing your hair out.    "
47,Pikmin 4,7.0,2,"One of the most prominent apps on my phone is a simple to-do list app. I have a handful of recurring tasks every month or year, along with whatever I jot down as a reminder. It took me more than 20 hours with Pikmin 4 before I identified that the sensation it evoked was the same as that of completing my to-do list. Pikmin 4 is a game, sure, but it's also a sort of low-impact activity that gives you the same satisfaction of checking off a list of small, relatively simple tasks. That makes it pleasant to play, but that quality also makes it feel discordant when it briefly adds elements that provide a mild but noticeable degree of pressure--elements that make it more traditionally ""game-like."" On the whole, I think I prefer Pikmin the activity to Pikmin the game.Pikmin 4 is meant to be a welcoming entry point for first-timers. The effort to bring you into the world of Pikmin begins very literally, with a character creator that allows you to make your own Rescue Crew member. The tools weren't robust enough to make a facsimile of me--very few beard options, for one thing--but I made a cute little man who I was proud of and wanted to see go on an adventure regardless. With my stubby adventurer fully formed, I was ready to explore the world of Pikmin.For the uninitiated, that world is basically a suburban Earth-like backyard. While the diminutive characters never acknowledge it, it's very clear from your surroundings that you've crash landed in a garden. Your surroundings might be checkered with gardening tools or mounds of dirt left by whoever occupied the home. There's a playful sense of scale to the setting that recontextualizes common household objects as massive obstacles or helpful bridges. Sometimes, you fall into a steady rhythm of puzzle-solving and completely forget the nature of your surroundings, until you suddenly pull back and realize there was a giant metal pail or bag of sod just next to where you've been excavating.Pikmin centers mostly around these environmental puzzles, as you guide your band of tiny plant-like Pikmin creatures around, seeking treasures and using their unique skills to traverse the world. A small puddle might seem like an impassable ocean to you and your Pikmin, but toss in a handful of Ice Pikmin and voila, the sea freezes up and you can cross it. Learning about each of the Pikmin's strengths and using them efficiently is part of the relaxing, chore-like cadence of Pikmin 4.The blue Ice Pikmin is one of the new types introduced in Pikmin 4, and as the fresh newcomer, it gets its fair share of attention with puzzles built around its unique attributes. Inversely, some returning Pikmin seem to get the short end of the stick with barely anything to do at all--the white, poison-resistant Pikmin and pink, flying Pikmin were treated like specialist classes, and barely used at all. Rock Pikmin, meanwhile, are hearty little creatures that make noticeably short work of walls, but they appear so late in the game that they aren't as frequently used as they might have been. In fact, for most of my playtime, I stuck almost entirely with the same core team: an even distribution of red, yellow, and blue Pikmin.Rounding out the regular cast of Pikmin is Oatchi, a two-legged dog-like creature. Unlike the Pikmin, which come along in different types and numbers, Oatchi is one-of-a-kind and your constant companion. It has the strength of multiple Pikmin, and you can split up to solve a puzzle. The best part about Oatchi, though, is that he's a rideable mount. Shortly after you get him, he grows big enough for you to ride, so you can hop aboard and explore the stage more quickly. This also makes it easier to visualize where all your Pikmin are. It's a little anxiety-inducing for me to have my Pikmin scattered loosely behind me, even if I know they're supposed to follow. Having them all clinging to Oatchi's fur (felt?) keeps them all together and tidy, and makes it very easy to visualize if one is lagging behind.Keeping your Pikmin close at hand is important because they're vulnerable, both to environmental hazards as well as the critters who roam around the garden. Unlike the gardening implements and backyard decor, these aren't generally recognizable creatures. Most of the otherworldly animals will crush or swallow your Pikmin whole. You can always go back to the ship to gather more Pikmin, but I never liked losing the critters. Part of that is because the other characters in your earpiece mourn their loss, but I also just felt generally uncomfortable with losing a resource, even if it could be refreshed. Especially when encountering a new enemy, it would be easy to get caught up in a new attack pattern or trap that I hadn't anticipated and lose a couple of Pikmin.Oatchi is useful in battle as well--not only can he attack enemies, but charging into enemies flings all of your Pikmin onto an enemy en masse, much faster than you could reasonably fling the little buggers manually. Freezing a large enemy with Ice Pikmin, for example, would risk losing some while you fling them one at a time, but charging into them with Oatchi freezes them almost immediately. Between the added security of keeping my Pikmin close and the combat advantages, riding on Oatchi became my standard mode of playing the game. Others might prefer to treat him like a super-Pikmin, who can dig out and transport treasure faster than the average critter. And while it's a small change, playing this way functionally looks and feels very different than a typical Pikmin game.For the times that you absolutely can't avoid losing Pikmin, there is now a new Rewind Time feature. Previous Pikmin games have offered a do-over at the end of the day, but Pikmin 4 expands the concept by regularly saving. You can't manually save during a day, and it's easy to see how that would be too exploitable, but the auto-saves typically happen every 2-5 minutes, so you never lose too much progress. For those who are very protective of their Pikmin, it's a huge convenience feature to just rewind a few minutes and try an encounter again if you ran into trouble in the interim.In the main exploration areas, which make up the bulk of the game, the Pikmin-tossing combat is incidental and mostly player-initiated. You can almost always keep your distance from a creature if you don't feel adequately prepared, so you're very rarely caught off-guard. Taking on enemies gets a much heavier emphasis in two new modes, which help break up the pacing with varying degrees of success.The more Pikmin 4 leans into fashioning itself after a more traditional game, with competition and fail-states, the more prone it is to getting in its own way.The first is the Night Missions, which take place after dark. These feature the new Glow Pikmin, and only Glow Pikmin, in a tower defense minigame. The presence of a glowing, nectar-like substance attracts and enrages the local fauna, but that nectar also happens to be a vital ingredient in your mission, so you have to protect the hive-like nests where it's generated until morning comes. Only a handful of them are mission-critical, though you can go on many more if you'd like. These aren't terribly difficult, but that feels intentional. The pace of Pikmin 4 is so relaxed that it would seem incoherent to have high-stress tower defense segments. While I'm sure they ramp up in difficulty if you want to do them all, it's nice having an option to do something different that has the same deliberate cadence.The same can't be said for Dandori, the other new game type. Often you'll find Leaflings--other explorers who have gone feral and have leaves covering their faces--and they'll challenge you to Dandori. The game explains that Dandori is a Japanese concept referring to orderly planning and efficiency, and in practice, these come in two varieties. The first is a Dandori Challenge to beat a high score within a time limit, while the other is a competitive Dandori Battle where you gather treasures against an AI opponent. This one is directly competitive, as you can steal one another's treasure and drop special items to disrupt their progress. Both flavors of Dandori felt at odds with the rest of the game. I didn't struggle too much in either type, but I did sometimes have to retry after just barely running out of time. Pikmin 4 is so centered around taking things at your own pace, it's strange having a game type that serves the exact opposite purpose.The in-campaign Dandori Battles are obviously meant to train you for the game's multiplayer mode, which is competitive Dandori against another human player. In fact, one of the very last story-required Dandori Battles introduced a new game mechanic, so it seemed clear that this was meant to serve as training wheels. Dandori against another human player may give the game legs, but I generally avoided playing these battles whenever possible in the campaign, and I can't really imagine wanting to do it against another player. Competitive Pikmin is such an odd concept; even saying it aloud sounds wrong.Pikmin 4 introduces a few other traditional game-like elements with more success. You can enhance Oatchi using the pup power granted by rescuing people, which lets you upgrade your canine companion with a stun power for its charge attack or the ability to withstand extreme cold. This gives you a welcome level of customization to use Oatchi as you like--in my case, I dumped everything into a few factors like speed and the charge attack and didn't see much use in the other upgrades. The other upgrade path comes from equipment, which you can purchase using the raw materials you gather. Those raw materials are also used sometimes to build simple bridges or ramps, though, so I made sure to keep some in reserve. A handful of equipment types are permanent upgrades, like the vital ability to call all Pikmin back to your base, while others are temporary power-ups. As with the Pikmin, I didn't want to waste my precious resources, so I used those sparingly (and sometimes, accidentally).Captain Olimar is a major factor in the story, but he's not the star. Instead, your mission is to find and rescue him, along with the first Rescue Crew dispatched to rescue Olimar, which also crashed. The distress signal sent out attracted a gold rush of other explorers and curious travelers, giving you plenty of hapless munchkins to rescue. Some turned into Leaflings that you need to challenge to Dandori to rescue, while others are just passed out at the hands of some strange bug-monster.That story, like most of Pikmin 4, is gentle and unobtrusive. It's all just very agreeable and sweet, and there's a certain gratification that comes from directing your little army of plant-people to gather treasures like fruits and Game Boy Advance cartridges. The more Pikmin 4 leans into fashioning itself after a more traditional game, with competition and fail-states, the more prone it is to getting in its own way. Sometimes, it's enough to simply have a relaxing activity."
4222,Eragon,4.0,0,"  Eragon the video game is based on the movie, which itself is based on the book of the same name. It's a typical fantasy world full of dragons, wizards, and magic, which would seem to lend itself well to a video game adaptation in the vein of the very good series of Lord of the Rings action games that came out alongside those movies. In fact, the Eragon game bears a striking resemblance to those Lord of the Rings games, which only makes sense because the games were all developed by the same company. But while the Lord of the Rings games were well-polished action games, Eragon feels unfinished and lazily thrown together. It's the same basic hack-and-slash principle that's readily accessible to just about any fan of the film, but Eragon feels like a skeleton of a game that's been padded out with some licensed content. There's not nearly enough to make the game interesting or even remotely worth playing, though. The action is mindless and repetitive at best, and buggy and unresponsive at worst. In addition, the presentation ranges from bland to ugly, the game is short, the fixed camera angles are frustrating, and there is no online play. Even for a straightforward action game, Eragon has very little to offer.         Eragon is a young farm boy in the fantasy world of Alagaesia. One day while out hunting, the boy stumbles upon a glowing blue orb that he thinks is a stone. Come to find out, it's actually a dragon egg. Eventually, a dragon hatches from the egg and Eragon discovers that he shares a magical bond with the creature. Turns out Eragon has been chosen as a legendary dragon rider, which is a warrior with special magic abilities that flies around on dragons and fights the impending evil that's sweeping across the land at the behest of a ruthless tyrant. It's up to Eragon to save the day by hacking through an army of clones in several linear, uninspired, and mercifully short levels.     You control Eragon, and you start out as a relatively feeble farmer. You have a sword and a bow, and you quickly learn to use magic, as well. There are 16 levels in the game, with a couple extra levels if you're playing the Xbox 360 version. You'll spend most of your time on foot, fighting wave after wave of generic enemies. You have a quick strike, a powerful strike, and a block for melee combat. You can string together combos of the two strikes to pull off special moves like grapples or knock downs. But even with those few moves, the action still boils down to mashing buttons until your thumb (or your brain) goes numb.      The enemies are all easy to kill, but they do take quite a few hits. So you can hack away at a foe uninterrupted for several seconds before he finally goes down, only to repeat the process with a dozen more enemies. It doesn't help matters that the hit detection is spotty at best. You'll often find yourself swinging away and watching your blade go right through your foes with no effect whatsoever. You can use a bow in the game to pick off enemies from afar, but since your bow does even less damage than your sword, you'll have to spend a long time slinging arrows at an enemy before it finally dies. There are some platforming sections in each level that require you to shimmy along ledges, climb up buildings or other structures, leap small gaps, and tiptoe across narrow beams. None of it is the least bit interesting or challenging, and it ends up feeling perfunctory and pointless.      As a dragon rider, Eragon is able to use magic, which factors into the combat in the game. The magic does actually make for some enjoyable moments, such as when you light enemies on fire and watch as they run off a cliff in a panic, or when you use magic to pull enemies off a high ledge. But even though you can do some fun things with a couple of the magic spells, it does very little to liven up the combat in the long run. Aside from pushing and pulling enemies and lighting them on fire, you can shoot magic arrows and use your magic to interact with the environment. Certain objects in the environment can be moved or rearranged using your magic. It's not very interesting, though, because you can't choose what you interact with or how you do it. Instead, it's usually along the lines of moving a pile of conveniently placed loose boards to create a makeshift bridge between two platforms.      Being a dragon rider, you do get to fly around on a dragon from time to time, but it's not nearly as fun as it sounds. The few flying levels in the game play like a rail shooter, where you fly around on a predetermined path and shoot enemies with magic arrows or blast them with your dragon's fire breath. The levels are simple loops, so you fly around in circles and kill the same enemies as they respawn endlessly. It's like being on a very tedious treadmill, because you never actually get anywhere. You just kill enemies until you've met the predetermined quota for the level.      You can easily beat Eragon in six hours, and once you've done that there's no reason to go back and play it again. Perhaps the only good news is that if you're playing the Xbox 360 version of the game, you can get some easy achievement points by completing each of the short levels on normal and hard difficulty settings. Other than that, there's not much to do in Eragon. A second player can join in at any moment during the game to play cooperatively, but the co-op suffers because both characters have to move in unison to keep all the action contained within one screen. This means that unless your partner moves with you, you can't go anywhere. It's also frequently possible for one character to get stuck behind an object in the environment if the other character moves too far ahead. One solution for that would be to let you play the game online, where each player has his or her own screen, but that feature is conspicuously absent. It's not a major loss, because this game isn't any more fun cooperatively than it is solo, but it's just one more way in which Eragon comes up short.      Another way that Eragon fails to impress is in its presentation. The game looks best on the Xbox 360, but even then it doesn't look good. The character models are all blocky and undefined, and although it's common in games of this type, the fact that there are only a handful of enemies to face just makes the game look and feel cheap. You'll see the exact same mobs over and over throughout the entire game. The fact that many of the levels look quite similar also makes the game feel repetitive and shallow, as if each level is exactly the same as the one before it. The character animations are no better. The few canned animations look decent, and some of the finishing moves are pretty brutal (and bloody if you're playing the PC or Xbox 360 version), especially for a T-rated game. However, most of the time the animations are stilted and jerky, and you'll often see enemies or ally characters get stuck behind objects and twitch wildly or clip through solid parts of the environment.      Eragon also has an extremely frustrating camera. The game employs fixed camera angles, so you have no control over your perspective on the action. That means that if you're behind an object, you're left to fight blind, which happens much more often than it should. The perspective also sometimes hides the path that you need to take to progress through the level. For instance, you might have to hop up and grab a ledge and pull yourself up to the next area, but with the fixed perspective, you won't even be able to tell that ledge is there.         The sound is also disappointing. Some of the music is halfway decent, but the voice acting is stiff and often missing entirely. John Malkovich plays the main enemy in the movie but doesn't have a single speaking line in the game. The actor who plays Eragon provides some voice-over work, but none of it sounds very good, and the dialogue consists almost entirely of terrible one-liners. The sound effects are functional, but there's nothing about the tinny clink of blade against blade to give the combat any weight.     Both as an action adventure game, and a licensed work, Eragon comes across as substandard in just about every way imaginable. It feels like an unfinished game that was rushed through to release in time for the movie to appear in theaters. The combat is repetitive, the presentation is dull and lifeless, and the entire game suffers from an apparent lack of effort.    "
3525,Snoopy Flying Ace,8.0,2,"Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge meets Peanuts in Snoopy Flying Ace, an Xbox Live Arcade game from developer Smart Bomb Interactive, which mashes Charles Schultz's legendary comic strip into an arcade flight sim. For just 800 points, you get a full-featured game loaded with ways to take Snoopy's famed Sopwith Camel into the skies, courtesy of a solo campaign, co-op missions, and a range of multiplayer modes. Dogfighting can be a bit on the shallow side in the single-player assignments and some of the multiplayer may be too chaotic to enjoy in the early hours, but you still get a lot of beagle-on-biplanes action for a very reasonable price.      Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, which came out for the PC, PlayStation 2, and PSP in 2006. This is more of a straightforward steampunk arcade shooter, with lots of odd futuristic weapons grafted onto century-old technology, than a Beagle's dream of being a WWI air ace. Still, the flight sim model here is loose and forgiving. All of the various plane models are easy to handle because they vary only in a few basic categories, like speed and turning. Plane movement is done courtesy of the left stick, rolls and loops are called up with the right stick, and shooting is mapped to the triggers. Special weapons like a shotgun, missiles, and even an EMP blast can be changed on the fly with the B button. You can get a look behind you with the right shoulder button. The intuitive control scheme is so friendly that you can settle in and start blowing up enemy planes right away.     However, it might have been nice if more were done with the Snoopy theme. Once you get past the basic concept of the delusional beagle flying into battle with the Red Baron in a World War I-era biplane, few references are made to the Peanuts cast. Charlie Brown drops in for a couple of appearances as a fellow flying ace you follow through races. You shoot down Lucy and Linus, along with lesser lights from the strip, such as Rerun and Pigpen, but they're identified only by text under their planes so they could just as well be anybody. Not a lot else has been taken from Schultz's comic aside from Snoopy's high-pitched laughing barks when sending bad guys down in flames and great piano tunes recalling the Vince Guaraldi scores from Peanuts cartoons (which are also augmented by some fantastical martial fight music during battles). So you end up forgetting all about the Peanuts subject matter and concentrating on just shooting stuff.     The focus here is on nonstop action, and thankfully, shooting is what Snoopy Flying Ace does best. Missions throughout the single-player campaign (which can also be played co-op over Live as one-off missions) are tightly structured. There are just a handful of types, though, so you're always taking on waves of the Red Baron's goons, defending bases with gun turrets, escorting recon balloons into enemy territory, attacking a zeppelin and its defense fighters before it can bomb your headquarters, and the like. Regardless of the main objective, you spend just about all of your time blasting away at streams of enemy planes that can spin and turn well enough to give you a bit of a challenge. Only a handful of races break the pattern, as in those missions where you fly through hoops, follow Charlie Brown through acrobatics, and rescue Woodstock and his pals from floating mines. Missions generally move along quickly, with you reaching the end of each in no more than a few minutes. The whole campaign can be wrapped up in just a couple of hours. Only the two zeppelin assignments drag a bit, as you can easily spend 20 minutes in each one of these showdowns before getting a final shot at perforating the balloon boss.        Competitive multiplayer has more long-term appeal. There are four basic game types on offer. Dogfight is a straight-up free-for-all mode that can be played mano a mano or with teams. Capture the Flag is exactly what it sounds like. Dog Pile is a battle to hold onto a bone. And Pigskin sees teams trying to fly a football into an end zone. All are fast and frenzied, as well as a real blast to get into due to all the pell-mell mayhem. More work was obviously put into the multiplayer, too, as it holds the lion's share of the achievements and even some cool Peanuts frills like your biplane morphing into Snoopy's doghouse if you clock nine kills without being taken out yourself. That said, it can be frustrating in the beginning because the congested maps result in your getting killed constantly while figuring out the lay of the land. Get some seasoning and the chaotic fun of the multiplayer modes--particularly the deceptively strategic Pigskin--evolve into a great time.     Graphics can be a bit of an issue in multiplayer. While the game generally looks great, with a range of distinct battlegrounds like a Snoopy-headed desert sphinx and the dusky skies above besieged Paris, the backdrops are occasionally so detailed and dark that you can't immediately identify enemy ships. This isn't that big of a deal when playing solo, but the problem is more serious when taking on cutthroat human opposition. Multiplayer seems to be a hit right now over Live, too, with dozens of players online, so you can get into a game instantly. This success might be a bit too much, however, because lag can be an issue in some matches, particularly when you're shooting it out at around the 16-player maximum.     Even though Snoopy Flying Ace might not be the deepest combat flight sim out there, you can't argue with how much game it gives you for the $10 asking price. Peanuts fans have grounds for complaint due to the strange lack of Snoopy-centric story and atmosphere, although there enough cameo appearances from the round-headed kid and his pals to remind you that this is a licensed game. Regardless of what you think of the story and setting, all of the solo, co-op, and multiplayer modes provide many hours of dogfighting action.  "
4929,Season Ticket Football 2003,2.0,0,"Season Ticket Football 2003 is the worst sort of sports management title. The Dave Koch Sports effort (best known online as Action! PC Football) is one of those curious amalgams of a migraine-inducing interface and relentless number crunching, a program so needlessly complex that you can't bring yourself to call it a game. Add in continual crashing and you have the leading entertainment option in the circle of hell designated for wife-neglecting couch potatoes who don't move a muscle on Sunday afternoons.   The biggest issue is the interface, which couldn't have been more counterintuitive. Strictly from a visual standpoint, things aren't that bad. But although the graphics are in line with those of the typical, text-heavy sports management sim (in this case, one with literally no sound at all), getting from point A to point B is nearly impossible. This is a problem right from the moment the program loads, as the initial menu screen doesn't actually offer the option of creating a new league. You can load a league, but that isn't much good if you don't have one to load. Not all the buttons even work properly. Hitting ""Play"" results in a run-time error and a drop to the desktop, unless you have a league up and running. Or, at least it seems that way--it's hard to make any concrete judgments about a menu system that is so vague and obscure.   Getting started with a league from scratch is a nightmare. Absolutely no pointers are given, so you're left to flail about, trying different menu commands in the hope that one actually leads where you're intending to go. Finding your way can take quite a while, as there are many likely candidates under the ""Start"" and ""League Utilities"" pull-down menus. Even when you do blunder into the right place, it takes a considerable amount of time to wade through the setup options. Something as straightforward as taking over a single team is about as much fun as applying for a mortgage. Things eventually become sort of clear, although you'll run out of patience with the pointlessly intricate design long before you start enjoying any football management. Never has a game more desperately needed an online help feature or a comprehensive print manual. The on-disc documentation is thorough, but it's poorly written and useless for getting started because it assumes that you have a basic idea of how things work. Virtually nothing is in the CD booklet at all, aside from a table detailing the effects of game time on player fatigue that is so brief it could have been tucked into a fortune cookie.   Going through all that hassle isn't remotely worthwhile, either. Season Ticket Football 2003 is too limited to satisfy most players. For starters, there is no career or dynasty mode. Although you can age players by a year before beginning a new season, ask the computer to select random retirements, and have a rookie draft, you essentially start from the beginning with every new season. You can't even bring a season to its proper conclusion, as there is no way to simulate the playoffs without setting up an independent tournament and manually plugging the teams into their respective places. All of which is odd, because there is a long list of rules and options that can be tweaked when setting up a league. There's no flow between the years or sense of building a franchise unless you take your league online and find human players. Generated numbers are respectable either way, though since we're dealing with fictional players and not the real superstars of the NFL, it's hard to make a determination about what's acceptable and what's not. Nothing stands out as being outrageous or impossible to believe, though.   Coaching a team in an individual game should be somewhat satisfying. You can even go online to take on live opponents. There are a lot of options available in regard to calling plays, and the games that result are typically authentic and entertaining. But you often can't finish them. Run-time errors show up frequently, often dumping you out to Windows in the midst of running a play. Actually, the program has trouble any time it has to deal with more than one window, or when you try to move a window. Just clicking on a menu bar will frequently reward you with a shortcut back to Windows via a run-time error box. Hitting buttons also brings up apparently random run-time errors. Additionally, it's easy to inadvertently ask for a report that cannot be generated. This brings up the same error message over and over again until you Ctrl-Alt-Del your way out. You'll want to raise a toast on those rare occasions when you get to intentionally shut down the program.   All this makes Season Ticket Football 2003 nothing short of insulting. You shouldn't have to waste hours of your leisure time trying to figure out the basic mechanics of the interface. You shouldn't have to jump through hoops just to set up a league with the default settings. You shouldn't have to experience recurrent run-time errors and crashes to the desktop. Thankfully, you can avoid all these problems by leaving the game on the shelf where you found it and backing away slowly.  "
2818,Mario Kart 7,8.0,2,"     The structure in Mario Kart 7 has remained unchanged from its many predecessors. Grand Prix races in 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc difficulties are available from the beginning, and you unlock mirror variants if you prove your worth in the initial offering. There are 32 tracks split evenly between new creations and returning favorites, with the retro versions revised to incorporate the new features introduced in this latest iteration. If you found yourself breezing through the single-player activities in previous games, then you should be glad to find a ramped-up difficulty in Mario Kart 7. Computer drivers are merciless in both their item usage and driving tactics, smartly taking tricky shortcuts or blocking your attempts to land shells on their noggins, which forces you to up your own skill if you're going to come out on top. The rubber banding that previously snatched victory from you at the last second has been drastically toned down in Mario Kart 7, so you finally feel as if you're in control of your own destiny. There is still one strange quirk, though: Your time is no longer recorded so you won't know just how narrowly you won (or lost).   Super Mario Kart, the more coins you're carrying, the faster your driver's top speed, which adds more strategy in how you handle turns. Do you go slightly out of your way for a couple of extra coins? Do you risk falling in a pit? It's a smart addition that makes you keep your eyes peeled for flashes of golden yellow, giving you even more to think about while you're navigating hairpin turns and avoiding deadly shells.      Although some of those those elements have appeared in previous games in some form or another, the hang glider is new. When you leap off a blue launchpad, your kart automatically sprouts magnificent wings until you touch back down. At first, this seems like a shallow gimmick, but after you experiment with what you're capable of once airborne, you realize just how much potential this new ability grants you. Once again, quick decision making is important. You can avoid the chaos happening below you if you stay safely in the clouds, and there are coins to collect as well. In some courses, tricky shortcuts are even available for those who have a daredevil's mentality. But other times, you may want to land as quickly as possible. Maybe there are item boxes below or boost pads, so hanging in the air is ultimately hurting your chance at victory.        Choice is a huge factor in why Mario Kart 7 is so exciting. Not only does every moment have you striving to hit the best line possible, but you have to decide the best possible route as well. It's an enticing system that makes every lap around the track feel unique. This feeling is further cemented by another new element: underwater driving. Just like some sections may force you to fly above the clouds, others thrust you into the briny deep. Once submerged, your kart moves more slowly, and exaggerated physics prop you on two wheels around turns. As with the gliding segments, sometimes you want to be underwater, where coins, item boxes, and shortcuts are hidden, whereas other times you want to circumvent this detour. You have to be quick and precise with your movements, and staying aboveground often requires you to tackle tricky turns, so there's a strong risk/reward element to contend with.      Excellent track design ensures that each of these elements is integrated in interesting ways. Shortcuts are present on almost every track, and figuring out not only where they're located but how to reach them requires you to thoroughly case the surroundings. But even when you realize what you have to do, getting there is hardly a piece of cake. Courses are littered with tight turns and deadly traps, continually pushing you to stay pointed the right way. Opponents can nudge you into the cavernous deep by either pelting you with items or slamming you with their karts, and the constant need to fight your foes along with the track creates a frenetic atmosphere that is exciting and rewarding. The retro tracks stand proudly next to the new so that no matter which you're on, you're engulfed in the experience. Seeing almost 20 years of tracks on display is a testament to how outstanding design stands the test of time. It doesn't matter if you're cruising down the newest iteration of Rainbow Road or the original from Super Mario Kart: the racing is fast, frantic, and always fun.     Mario Kart Wii, and it eliminates the huge disparity that was present in Mario Kart DS between snakers and non-snakers. Now you can focus on getting the right line, which is a more fair solution. Unfortunately, there isn't an option to use the D-pad. Although the circle pad works well, steering isn't quite as responsive without a digital alternative. If you fancy yourself a real kart driver, a cockpit view puts you right in the action. In this perspective, you can move your kart by tilting the system, and this is a fun addition to the formula. Because you can't see your surroundings, it isn't as useful as the normal third-person view, but it's neat to experiment with.        Driving is key in Mario Kart 7, but that doesn't mean the battle elements have fallen by the wayside. Items have been rebalanced this time around to ensure the best driver can stay in first place once he or she reaches that position. A tanooki tail is the most important of the new items. This lets you bat away shells and other objects if they come too close to you, and you can even send other drivers into the pit if they're getting too feisty. The fireflower also works more as a deterrent than a formidable attack. This lets you quickly launch fireballs that don't do much damage but allow you to gain a bit of breathing room when someone comes too close. These are great additions to the franchise because they help shift the balance away from items and back to racing. However, the blue shell is still overpowered. There's almost no way to avoid this first-place-seeking missile, so it can feel cheap when you're blasted off the road with no chance to escape from it. Still, these moments are rare enough that things don't feel unfair.      Mario Kart 7 contains a cast of 17 characters, eight of which are available at the start. They each have their own attributes, so you have to carefully decide if you want the quickness of Shy Guy or the heft of Rosalina. Having a wide assortment of characters to select from is certainly welcome, though the unlockable cast is fairly weak. Longtime fishing fan Lakitu makes his first appearance as a driver, and getting him off his cloud and into a kart is certainly novel, but most of the other characters you earn don't have the same appeal. Wiggler and Honey Queen look downright strange trying to fit into a kart (like Petey Piranha before them), and Metal Mario isn't even a real character. At least there aren't any baby variants this time around, nor do you have to put up with creepy female versions of male staples (Toadette, anyone?), but it's still a lackluster assortment of individuals.      Also disappointing is the brevity of the single-player activities. In Mario Kart DS, there was a mission mode that gave you more to do outside of the standard Grand Prix. These mini challenges had you driving through gates, collecting coins, defeating bosses, and engaging in other kart-based shenanigans and gave legs to the games when you couldn't round up friends to play. That feature has been unceremoniously axed in Mario Kart 7, which makes for a weaker overall package. Thankfully, there are so many unlockables to earn that you can play by your lonesome for hours before you see everything, but that doesn't make up for the removal of an entire mode. Battle mode is available in single and multiplayer, but it feels too similar to the battle mode in previous games to make it an exciting alternative to the Grand Prix. The racing is still extraordinarily fun in Mario Kart 7, but a little extra content would have gone a long way toward making this feel special.        As in previous games in the series, Mario Kart 7 is at its best when you play against human opponents rather than the inhuman AI. Up to eight players can take part, either locally or online, and you can share your game with others if they don't have a copy of their own. Going head-to-head with a group of hard-driving competitors is loads of fun, and things are so volatile that you can play for hours and still see new permutations. Competition is at its best in local play, when people can yell at each other or high-five after a great run, but online serves admirably if you don't have friends handy, though it's not without faults. Against random individuals, you're limited to one-off races. Because you stay in the same room, you can choose to play again, but being kicked out of a race has a disjointed feeling because there's no cumulative record of results. This feeling can be alleviated in the communities feature. Here, you create your own group, determine the speed, and decide which items you want to use. It's a neat addition, but if you want others to join you, they have to enter a code. It's a shame you can't just search for like-minded individuals and join their community. Once you start racing, things are great, but the infrastructure could use some work.      Mario Kart 7 contains the same framework that has existed in the franchise for years but has enough tweaks to the formula to stave off that stale feeling. The new additions, such as hang gliding and kart customization, should become permanent staples, and rebalanced items remove the feeling that you were unfairly robbed of victory. From a racing perspective, this is the best entry yet in the long-running series, and excellent track design pushes you to be inventive and smart in how you drive. However, the online structure has a few notable issues, and the removal of the mission mode is a big disappointment. Despite some problems, Mario Kart 7 is another explosive entry in the franchise.    "
2976,Deus Ex: Human Revolution,8.0,2,"    Deus Ex, you will appreciate seeing the origins of the turmoil to come, before nanotechnology further revolutionized the human condition. Electronic books you stumble upon hint at the coming innovation; newspapers document increasing social tensions (and, cleverly, refer to how you completed your most recent mission); and emails and PDAs provide insight into the minds of the game's key figures.        The visual design does a great job of setting the stage for those tensions. Human Revolution's color palette makes frequent use of gold and black, which results in eye-catching visual contrasts. Take, for example, a nightclub in Shanghai called The Hive. The honeycomb design stretching across its neon yellow exterior is not only striking, but also similar to interface elements associated with augmentations. This kind of thematic and visual consistency is common and makes for a cohesive atmosphere even when trotting across the globe. Human Revolution takes great pains to be believable and immerse you in its world, which makes its technical deficiencies all the more noticeable. The city districts you explore are good sized but not enormous, which makes the extended loading times between them seem drastic. You spend minutes at a time in lengthy conversations, staring at the dated, mechanical facial animations. On the Xbox 360 in particular, the frame rate can take a hit as you pan the camera around--a distraction in any case and a greater annoyance during firefights. On consoles, it feels like developer Eidos Montreal tried to squeeze a bit more out of its graphics engine than it could handle. On the PC, the game performs adequately but still looks slightly dated. But this is a case in which good art design overcomes the technology that renders it. The game is as much about places as it is about people, and it does an excellent job of giving its environments character and grit.      And so you perform story missions and side quests in these cities, where hobos huddle around flaming barrels for warmth and private security firms intimidate the locals. You find answers for a grieving mother, publicly humiliate a cowardly murderer, and seek a dangerous hacker. And in most cases, how you accomplish your tasks depends on how you wish to play. Let's say you must make your way through a heavily guarded facility. If you prefer the direct approach, you could shoot your way through. During the course of the game, you find or purchase pistols, revolvers, combat rifles, shotguns, and more--and you gain access to augmentations that further support your violent tendencies. As you play, you earn experience; in turn, you then earn praxis points used to unlock new skills and enhancements. Players into bloodshed should appreciate the dermal augmentations that increase your armor, reduce weapon recoil, increase inventory space, and improve resistance to concussion grenades. From the action-packed perspective, Human Revolution plays like a cover shooter. When you snap behind cover, the camera pulls into a third-person view, and you peek out or pop up to load your enemies with lead.        The shooting mechanics are fine but not outstanding. The cover system works well, but even with dermal upgrades, you are still fragile enough to feel in danger when you engage the enemy. And ammo is scarce enough (though not frustratingly so) that you'll want to make every shot count. Unfortunately, the none-too-smart AI frequently diminishes that sense of danger. It isn't uncommon for enemies to empty clip after clip shooting at the wall you are hiding behind, refuse to shoot back even when you're pumping bullets into them, or jump en masse into a grenade rather than away from it. Actually, it isn't just enemies that act in unconvincing ways. In many cases, you can tap away at people's computers right in front of them, saunter into a shopkeeper's storeroom to steal credit chips and ammo, and emerge from air ducts right in front of fellow Sarif employees. For what it's worth, the previous Deus Ex games also featured such illusion-breaking details. And like before, those details stand out because the game otherwise works so hard to create a believable cyberpunk world.    Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction, the stealth gameplay will feel familiar. You can tumble from cover spot to cover spot or press against walls and obstacles to remain out of view. And again, the right augmentations can complement this play style. In this case, they take Human Revolution from plain-Jane sneaker into fully featured stealth game. Eventually, you can observe enemy figures through walls, see their cones of sight on your minimap, or mark them with pips to make them easier to track. But even while sneaking, you can feed your hunger for violence with a melee attack. If you're feeling generous, you can clobber your enemy but leave him alive and earn a few extra experience points for your kindness. Or, you can forfeit the extra experience but get the rush of a vicious assassination.        These takedowns are accompanied by canned animations. The camera pulls out as you watch Adam knock some sense into a guard (or two guards, with the right augmentation) before returning to the game. These moments are often dramatic, but like other parts of Human Revolution, they can also disrupt the atmosphere the game works so hard to create. Your target might teleport to a new location for cinematic purposes or clip through a wall or another enemy. Meanwhile, any other characters in your field of view are frozen in place as if time has come to a momentary standstill. Such foibles aside, takedowns are a satisfying way to release the tension that naturally builds as you carefully inch ahead. And there are other gratifying payoffs to successful stealth. Some areas are guarded by robotic sentries--some of them large and intimidating. You could throw an EMP grenade in their direction, which results in a brilliant eruption of metal and sparks. But it's even more fun to hack into a security panel and turn them against their unsuspecting masters, though again, you need the right augmentation to pull off that technique.        Then again, you could discover other alternate points of entry. If you're strong enough, you can gain access to conveniently human-sized air ducts by moving vending machines and trash dumpsters out of the way. If you can jump high enough, you might leap a fence that stands behind you and the area you must access. Another augmentation allows you to see weak points in walls and punch through them. (Like stealth takedowns, this move results in a canned animation.) You might pluck a PDA with security codes from a corpse that allow you to open doors or access emails--emails that might contain even more such codes. You might also find PDAs sitting around on occasion. In Deus Ex: Invisible War, such codes were so easily found that the whole idea came across as relatively contrived. In Human Revolution, you might find such codes in hidden areas within a sewer or on a computer in a remote office. Because they aren't always found in ultraconvenient locations, the whole business of espionage feels less artificial. The game encourages you to thoroughly scavenge; whether you find codes, ammo, or a weapon you hadn't seen before (hey look: a laser rifle!), there is always an advantage to opening a row of lockers or getting into a locked storage area.      Don't worry if you can't find a relevant code, though. Hacking is a particularly enjoyable way of getting through locked doors. In the previous games, hacking was a mostly hands-free affair. Now, you must perform a minigame that involves creating a digital network path before the computer can shut you out. At higher levels, some locks can be rather tricky, though you can find hacking programs that ease the challenge. Some areas--a newsroom, for example--are full of computers begging to be hacked, and there are enough story tidbits, humorous Easter eggs, and other secrets to make it worth checking them all out. Hacking can get rather addictive, so don't be surprised if you lose 30 minutes or more just opening every lock you can find. But the joy doesn't just lie in the hacking on its own, but also in the context of such freedom. You could play as primarily a hacker, a sniper, or a sneak, but Human Revolution is flexible enough to let you mix and match as you see fit. If you get caught creeping around a rooftop or hacking a lock, shooting your way out is a viable alternative. If you tire of one approach, there's always another to try. And even when you arrive at your destination, you might see a vent in the corner and realize there was another way in that you never discovered.        You can even talk your way out of (or into) certain situations if you so choose. Some characters respond well to empathy; others prefer tough love. If you prefer charming your way past obstacles, you will enjoy the related augmentation, which unveils personality details on your conversation partner, among other helpful features. Adam himself doesn't infuse these talks with much character. He speaks with a dispassionate rasp, whether you respond to others with anti-tech rhetoric or empathize with your fellow augs. That said, he's much like the original's J. C. Denton in this regard, which should delight fans who want Human Revolution to be closer to that game than the oft-maligned Invisible War. In any case, your dialogue choices influence how certain quest details play out and might open up additional avenues. (For example, you might be able to gain unhindered access to a police station rather than have to sneak around.) Furthermore, your decisions determine which of the game's several endings you receive.      It's both fascinating and frustrating that Human Revolution, a game that's special precisely because it allows you so much freedom, would occasionally force you into a single style of play. This is especially true of the boss fights, most of which turn this free-form, do-it-your-way role-playing action game into a shooter. This may not annoy you too much if you've been playing it as one, but if you've built yourself up as a stealth star, a hacking hero, or a jack-of-all trades, boss encounters are not a welcome change of pace. Not only does forcing you to shoot feel out of place in a game that generally rewards you for keeping your foes alive, but the fights also aren't that fun on their own terms. Once you figure out your enemy's pattern, you just repeat the same moves until you whittle down his or her inflated life bar. (A life bar, mind you, that you cannot see.) On the flipside, a few side quests require you to hack locks of a particular level, which might frustrate action-oriented players who don't want to forgo the quests but also don't want to be forced into buying augmentations they don't particularly want.        Don't let these imperfections dissuade you from playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution if you're so inclined. This is an extensive (20-plus hours) game that by the very nature of its complexity invites replay. It is true that many of its individual elements don't withstand close inspection. But those elements add up to an impressive and absorbing adventure that invites you to improvise. You glide from rooftops like a cyberpunk angel in a world on the brink of technological breakthroughs and socioeconomic disaster, and uncover conspiracies in the unlikeliest of places. The longer you play, the more the story grabs you and the more you appreciate the customizability of the game. Hybrid games like this are uncommon. Even more uncommon are games with Human Revolution's power to eclipse its quirks with such enthralling atmosphere and exciting adaptability.      "
3860,Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics,5.0,1,"  Rarely is sorting through after-battle loot handled as poorly as it is in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics. While this PSP title from Kuju Entertainment is a mostly satisfying look at hardcore role playing, courtesy of slavish attention to D&amp;D's version 3.5 rule set, a spectacularly awkward interface slows the action to a crawl both before and after the long swords come out. Venturing into the bowels of the earth to slay dragons and load up on gold pieces has rarely been so tedious.     Despite the title, D&amp;D Tactics is actually a fairly straightforward turn-based RPG. The emphasis on tactical combat is only about as pronounced as you'd find in something like the old Gold Box games, which actually seems old-school appropriate for the debut of D&amp;D on the PSP. Battles are the primary focus here, making the pace more measured than the standard contemporary RPG. But even though you need to have some appreciation for the 3.5 edition of the pen-and-paper D&amp;D rules to truly enjoy this game, combat intricacies aren't too over-the-top. For the most part, you just need to have a reasonable idea of how to use each character class when it comes to melee and ranged fights, as well as some common sense when it comes to whipping out area-effect spells, such as a fireball. If you're a total newbie at this stuff, at least there are four opening tutorials to get you up to speed.        The only real difference between this game and a garden variety RPG is the predominance of set-piece missions with straightforward cleaning-house objectives. Instead of looking for the answers to some big mystery, you kill all of the goblins in a crypt, wipe out a bunch of thieves, or take on some similar style of methodical mayhem. While the role-playing depth isn't tremendous, there are loads of options. Full six-person adventuring parties are created from all of the D&amp;D core classes, such as the mage, fighter, cleric, and rogue. There are also more esoteric selections, such as the barbarian and a pair of psionicists. You select which ones go on each assignment. All of the standard races are here as well: human, elf, dwarven, halfling, half-orc, and so on. Characters are fully detailed with all the expected skills and feats, whether you choose from the sizable pre-rolled crew or whip up your own. Their backgrounds even include such extras as god worshipped (nice to see St. Cuthbert again).     The game's story is a pretty ordinary fantasy tale. The lengthy solo campaign deals with the usual claptrap about arcane prophecies of doom, magical artifacts, and the end of the world. All events are also nicely illustrated with what look to be painted scenes that wouldn't have looked out of place on a panel van in the '70s. Most of it is driven by hack-and-slash dungeoneering although there are some choices to be made. The ethical ""alignment"" you choose for your characters--whether they have evil, neutral, good, lawful, or chaotic outlooks on life--is also a concern. It can be very tough to remain on the straight and narrow as a good guy; make a few bad choices as a noble paladin, and before you know it, your character's alignment has changed to evil.     That is, if you can get that far. All of the good aspects of D&amp;D Tactics are sabotaged by major design flaws. Wrestling with the interface is the biggest headache. Although the two-part, turn-based movement and combat system is efficient when it comes to shifting your characters around the chessboard-like movement squares, as well as having-at-you in battle, everything features too many extra steps. You can't just push a single button and move, you need to push a button then scroll across a bunch of choices to select the move command. Same goes for attacking, casting spells, pulling items out of your backpack, resting, and so on, so that even the most common actions involve scrolling through at least three or four choices laid out in branching menus.     Sorting through items dropped by slain foes is even more irritating because you have to juggle the menus and deal with scant on-hand information on your new goodies. An extra four or five steps are needed just to find out if that cool new sword you've picked up is better than the shiny metal toothpick that you're currently wielding. And you have to go through this process every time you rob corpses because otherwise, your party ends up getting encumbered by all the weighty junk they have to carry around.     As a typical dungeon crawler, most of the action takes place in dark settings. This is great for atmosphere, especially when you've lit up a torch, but it's awful for control because it's impossible to see anything. Monsters often pop up out of nowhere. You're wandering through an empty crypt one moment, but the next moment, you'll be wondering: Where the hell did that pack of goblins came from? Worse, you can't rotate the camera back far enough to get a reasonable view of what's in front of you. It tilts some, but not nearly enough to see more than about 20 feet away from your characters, so you're stuck with what amounts to a top-down view on the action. This adds to the monster-pop-up irritation and makes it hard to explore dungeons because you never seem to get a good look at your surroundings. Making matters even more annoying is the camera's quick panning back and forth. When fighting long-range with bows or spells, it zips back and forth too fast for you to see exactly what's going on around you. For instance, if you summon a monster right at the feet of a baddie, the camera will snap back to you before it's even materialized, leaving you to wonder if the spell worked or not until you get around to your turn again. The speedy camera also makes it easy to miss a character getting knocked down to zero hit points and then bleeding to death.        Wireless multiplayer is supported, but it doesn't really add much to the game. You can't play cooperatively through the campaign, so your only options are monster bash and deathmatch. Both are pretty much mind-numbing killing sprees, although the former at least emphasizes teamwork. Its one big limitation is a paltry selection of just three maps (deathmatch fares a little better with five). Only the ability to switch character levels all the way from three to 15 adds any life to this mode of play.     Both visual and audio quality seem murky. Details on your characters and the monsters are so small that it's hard to tell who's who or what's what. The graphics are also afflicted with off-putting animations. Freshly killed foes kneel down like they're praying instead of collapsing like they've just shuffled off this mortal coil. Because this slumped-over posture doesn't vary much from standing up, it's tough to determine if an enemy is dead or not. All characters seem to make strange moves compared to what they're supposed to be doing. For example, opening a chest results in a triumphant leap into the air. Firing a crossbow looks like pitching a baseball. The animations are so far off that you often wonder if you've actually made the move that you intended. As far as audio goes, weapon clashes and bangs are tinny, while the choral music of the main score are so repetitive that you'll almost immediately mute the volume.     Faithfully re-creating its tabletop big brother is the sole positive aspect of D&amp;D Tactics. And that's certainly commendable, especially if you're a nuts-and-bolts rules fan. With a better interface and some serious tweaks to the visuals, this one could have been a contender. But as it is, the game has too many design problems to enchant anyone aside from pen-and-paper diehards jonesing for D&amp;D on the PSP.  "
2386,Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards,4.0,0,"      Reloaded makes concessions to the modern era, but its roots show quite clearly. Larry appears on mostly static backdrops, and you click onscreen icons to encourage interaction. Each screen contains several points of interest, and each poke and prod is narrated with gusto. The actor clearly relished his role, and he manages to make the rampant sexual innuendo come off every bit as sleazily as possible. There's lots of material to work with, too, which means you hear numerous jokes about sex and the male and female anatomy even though the artists didn't bother to illustrate the bulk of it (which is just as well, in some cases). The dialogue is also fond of breaking the fourth wall, sometimes even for genuine laughs.        Even with so many restrictions in place, it's easy to run into temporary dead ends as you try to coach Larry to coital bliss. Reloaded plays out as a more perverted version of the more monotonous games of its original era, so that whenever you find a new location, you need to run around licking, groping, examining, and talking to everything, just to make sure you're not missing something. Your alternative is to potentially overlook an important clue, then spend a half hour or more making a circuit of the city, trying to discover what you missed. Sometimes this process becomes ridiculous. For instance, the casino has eight floors. Most of those floors have doors you can tap on to interrupt people who are having sex on the other side, but you can't assume that's always true, because what if you then miss something important? You have no choice but to hear every silly joke at least once, and perhaps many times if you find yourself truly flummoxed.     Moments when you're wandering around because you've missed a clue--perhaps even one that you've been holding in your inventory the whole time--only serve to highlight the game's most regrettable flaw: its interface. The new setup may have been improved compared to the old standard, but it still has a long way to go. If you are wandering a street and interacting with objects outside, that requires the hand icon to be active. Passing through the door to enter some buildings may (or may not) then require you to switch to the foot icon. Once inside, you need to switch back…except when you don't. Riding a taxi from one location to another is also inconvenient, not to mention expensive. You can earn additional money to pay for fare only by playing games of chance, so you're essentially encouraged to save a file after each win and to reload one after you lose, lest you exhaust your funds and find yourself forced to accept charity from a wandering bum.       "
2843,NCIS,2.0,0,"     Ties with the hit CBS TV series about a team of investigators solving various murders and other nasty crimes on behalf of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in Washington, DC, are front and center, of course. The marketing here revolves around you supposedly working with the well-known team of sleuths led by Mark Harmon's Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo, and Cote de Pablo's Ziva David. You take part in four different cases structured like episodes of the TV show, complete with opening credits, B plots that let the characters indulge in some very non-witty repartee (you will want to kill DiNozzo in mere moments), and closing unfunny moments geared to inject a bit of lighthearted fun into all the murder and mayhem. The reality sees you slogging through tedious pixel hunts at crime scenes and enduring simplistic minigames geared for children. The content and the gameplay contrast so much that the game can be quite jarring; You investigate bloody murders and conduct autopsies via minigames that could have been taken out of a game aimed at 6-year-olds.     Each episode plays out in the same fashion that the procedural TV show does each week. You watch an opening sequence showing the crime to be investigated, and then you plunge into work at crime scenes and with forensics back in the lab. All of the searching, sampling, and bagging have been distilled to simply searching rooms and taking photos of evidence, such as bullet holes and explosive residue (that magically translate into actual physical evidence like slugs and powder that can be analyzed back in the lab). The most obnoxious part of this sleuthing is navigating the crime scenes themselves, because the camera angle is locked so tight to your character that you can't move more than a few feet per button press.        Once all of the requisite photographs have been collected at the crime scene, you switch to forensics back at the NCIS offices. Everything is based on minigames. Need to lift prints off a gun? Snap the left stick around to apply and remove tape. Need to conduct an autopsy? Scroll around the body taking photos. Need to analyze tire treads? Match up samples by scrolling through a short list of options. Need to figure out who did what to whom? Hit the ""deduction board"" to drag and drop clues before answering a multiple-choice quiz to solve crimes. Need to interrogate a suspect? Watch the dialogue and hit the A button every so often to ask a follow-up question. All of the games are spectacularly easy. It is just about impossible to fail any of them at any time, but even if you mess up by, say, falling asleep, you get do-overs courtesy of the Caf-Pow drinks favored by forensic Goth goddess Abby Sciuto both here and on the TV show. And even if you run out of this magical beverage, failure just means that you get to try again.    People's Sexiest Man Alive. But mostly you just wonder how much Ubisoft saved by not bothering to properly animate these sequences.        Aspects of the art seem to have been assembled from older games, too. How else to explain the appearance of massive CRT monitors on desks in the otherwise high-tech NCIS offices? There is virtually no music to speak of during gameplay, and character dialogue is recited in a reading-the-phonebook manner by a cast that includes only a pair of secondary characters from the TV show. Oddly, those characters are two of the biggest names to appear on the series: Robert Wagner and David McCallum. They say next to nothing, however, and Wagner shows up for little more than a cup of coffee before exiting stage left. The roster of cheap soundalikes that fill out the rest of the cast is unimpressive at best, especially the one-note wonder taking the place of star Harmon.     The only possible plus in NCIS is that the simplistic, repetitive gameplay likely depicts the drudgery of real police investigations far more accurately than procedural TV shows loaded with lasers and sci-fi gadgets. Of course, you have to think that the developers probably weren't going for that sort of authenticity here. Stick to the TV show. Or knitting. Knitting's good.   Full disclosure: NCIS, the television show on which this game is based, airs on CBS, GameSpot's parent company."
3427,Ivy the Kiwi?,8.0,2,"     Ivy the Kiwi begins with beautifully illustrated pages from a storybook that set up your adventure. Having (almost fully) hatched to find herself alone in the forest, Ivy takes off at a run in search of her mother, and you are dropped into the first stage. Each stage is built with stationary blocks that hang in midair in front of a static background, but both elements are slightly animated. This effect combines with the frosted edges of the screen to create kind of an antiquated, illustrated look. The visuals, along with the looping music for each level, give the presentation a simple, familiar charm. In a way, the abundance of blocks feels like a missed opportunity, given the potential for fully fleshed-out, detailed environments. Yet the simplicity resonates well with the gameplay, giving the overall package a pleasing sense of harmony.             This thoughtful structure offers incentive to casual players and challenge seekers alike, the latter of whom can also strive to top the score leaderboards for complete play-throughs, or earn medals by playing stages individually. To earn medals, however, you must first collect all 10 feathers found on each level. In early levels these feathers are generally found along your way to the finish, while later on they become trickier and trickier to acquire. Those who need a little help (or just want a little company) can have a second player join them at any time. With twice as many vines onscreen there is more potential for protecting Ivy, as well as a greater tendency for Ivy to get all tangled up. If tangling is more your speed, there are a bunch of splitscreen multiplayer stages that up to four players can compete in. Players must guide their own Ivy towards their own goal, but getting to the end is much tougher because your friends can draw vines on your screen to obstruct you. Though things often get a bit too tangled, there is some frantic amusement to be found here.     Ivy the Kiwi does a good job of using simple gameplay mechanics to create a layered, engaging adventure. Experienced players may find it quite easy in the early going, but there is a solid, satisfying challenge to be found in many of the later levels. Even though the blocky levels may make you yearn for more detailed, vibrant environments, the presentation still strikes a nice chord that is likely to please. Very reasonably priced at $29.99, Ivy the Kiwi has a good mix of charm and challenge, with unique visuals and clever gameplay that make it quite appealing.    "
3557,Desert Thunder,5.0,1," A budget-priced game that adopts some of today's hottest technologies--in this case, Unreal's graphics engine and MathEngine's vaunted Karma physics modeling--is not something you see every day. It's especially rare when it's blended with a storyline that's not only contemporary but also downright pertinent to current headlines. Nevertheless, this is precisely the formula behind Groove Games' Desert Thunder, a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later tank-based orgy of ordnance. The good news is that Desert Thunder is a sensory overload of explosive, destructive good times that'll cost less than a family outing at the local fast-food joint. The bad news is that the game is so easy to learn and so very arcade-oriented that anyone who appreciates longevity, tactics, and even a modicum of authenticity will inevitably be disappointed.      Designed by first-time developer Brainbox Games, Desert Thunder is a rough-and-tumble affair that puts you in the role of a tank commander who is stationed in an unnamed Middle Eastern hot spot. As is customary for most games of this ilk, you are the only remaining representative of the ""forces of good."" Everyone else has been permanently wiped from the map, and scheduled reinforcements are nowhere to be found. As a result, you and you alone must now battle hordes of unidentified terrorists.   As the game opens, you'll find yourself looking down upon your vehicle from a slightly elevated rear-chase perspective. You may raise or lower this vantage point and adjust the camera so that it follows either your swiveling turret or your tank, but otherwise, this is the only camera in Desert Thunder. Zooming is not permitted at any time, neither in the main window nor in the miniature topographical map/radar located in the lower left of the screen. You cannot access enemy views, weapons views, or binocular views, nor can you look freely about the countryside. And you can't jump inside your machine for a first-person perspective, either.   This absence of perspective variance is one of the big problems in a game that concerns itself primarily with the fine art of tank warfare. Though Desert Thunder often requires you to battle enemies over great distances or when hidden just behind a hillside or massive outcropping, it doesn't offer the necessary viewing tools for the job. Additionally, the game doesn't give you any method for controlling--or even knowing--the maximum length, the proposed arc, or the trajectory of your upcoming cannon or minigun volleys. Instead, you can only adjust your positioning and move your turret up and down blindly, not really knowing if you have a good read on the current situation until you've actually fired off a couple of volleys. Worse still, you can't adjust your cannon into a steep enough orientation to effectively lob shells toward short distance targets. Consequently, if you need to attack an enemy who's just 50 feet away but is positioned on the other side of an obstacle, you're forced to bring yourself, at least partially, into the open to do so. Furthermore, you're never able to stealthily tuck yourself away behind an object, which prevents you from skillfully working out a proper trajectory for your attack.   That having been said, Desert Thunder is far from a stealthy game. In reality, this is an action-packed arcade-style game. Moreover, unless you really need to use a given object for cover, the suggested tactic is to shoot everything that looks even marginally shootable. That list includes live enemy vehicles, the smoking hulks of damaged enemy vehicles, large fortresses, small structures, guard towers, airplanes, and even perfectly innocent boulders and palm trees. Why? Because there's a chance that by taking out that big rock in front of you, you'll also impact or kill the enemy who's hiding behind it. Furthermore, many of the seemingly most innocuous objects house the very staple of the Desert Thunder world--the power-up.      Yes, Desert Thunder has power-ups. When you begin the game, you have an infinite number of basic cannon shells and basic minigun rounds. But to appreciably advance, you need the beefed-up ordnance you can only find through power-ups. Whether you uncover a high-impact shell, a homing shell, a hellfire shell, an armor-piercing minigun round, or a 10-percent or 50-percent repair token is unknown, but you can bet that you'll discover at least one of the above in every three or four rocks or palm trees that you demolish.   Certainly, you'll need all the help you can get when you move beyond the game's ""easy"" level to the ""standard"" level and then to the ultra-demanding ""difficult"" levels. Newcomers will undoubtedly want to first try their hands at easy mode, where they can most often barnstorm through their enemies without too much fear. Here, they'll face substantially smaller numbers and significantly less-destructive firepower. However, when campaigning the ""standard"" or ""difficult"" levels, the sheer number of enemy forces and the damage factor of their weapons grows by leaps and bounds. At the difficult setting, wherein adversaries attack the moment you become visible, the game's lack of advanced targeting and camera/zoom functions becomes a serious detriment. Ultimately, you'll be compelled to play in a fastidiously cautious fashion by creeping along--sometimes an inch or two at a time.    As challenging as its difficult level is, Desert Thunder can never be accused of being a long-term affair. Indeed, in easy mode, most experienced action players should polish off the entire game, from beginning to end, within a single afternoon. The question then becomes whether the excitement of seeing the exact same landscape in the exact same linear fashion (but with far more enemies and harder-hitting weapons) is enough of a driving force for another go. If you're the type who appreciates a good firefight and oodles of impressive explosions, it probably will be. If you're looking for more variety or a more deeply engaging or authentic experience, it probably won't. In the end, even the most ardent fan will have trouble seeing this game through more than just a few days.      From a purely visual standpoint, Desert Thunder feels both stripped-down and impressive at the same time. On the upside, the game's resemblance to the latest versions of Unreal is evident. Though the stars of the show--the tanks--are somewhat primitively rendered, the majority of the scenery is relatively solid. Enemy soldiers are authentically drawn and are fully reactive to the situation. They may react a bit oddly at times--by walking into the open and letting loose with their rifles or rocket-propelled grenades--at least they don't stand there motionless. As for enemy tanks, the truth is that it's difficult to distinguish a T-72 from a more powerful T-90. The slickest vehicle of all is the mobile antitank vehicle, which launches a spectacular flurry of homing missiles that inevitably find their target.   The game is at its best when you're simply out there blowing stuff up. Whether targeting a group of enemy foot soldiers on a bridge, a top-heavy guard tower, or just a brick-built apartment building on a city street, you can be rest-assured that the item in question will explode in a profusion of smoke, fire, and broken parts. Certain players may also enjoy the bloody thrills that come from running down a foot soldier or blowing one off of a rooftop.   Nevertheless, the presentation is clearly not as sophisticated as it could be. Most vexing is the game's distance-fogging, which impacts the game aesthetically and makes far-off targeting an impossibility. As soon as an enemy comes into view, it has most likely seen you as well. Additionally, there simply isn't enough vehicular variety. Your own tank looks the same from beginning to end, whether it's taken heavy damage or has just received a bevy of power-ups. The same applies to enemy vehicles, which show damage only when they finally succumb to you (though they never receive any upgrades). Even the game's final enemy, an experimental Russian-made tank, doesn't look all that impressive, even if it is an enormous beast with several cannons.      There are other annoyances scattered throughout the Desert Thunder world as well. It does not support multiplayer battles, it keeps track of just one saved game at a time, and its mandatory rear-chase view often becomes muddled in nearby scenery. The game's sound is fair, exhibiting big booming cannon fire and some truly cataclysmic explosions, but it simply isn't varied enough. When you get to the third or fourth hour of gameplay--which in easy mode may be near the end of the game--you'll be hoping for anything to break up the repetition.   Because of its cost-conscious price point, Desert Thunder can be forgiven for some of its foibles. And it certainly delivers some absolutely hellacious firefights and tons of cool break-apart items. Nevertheless, though, a game that offers so little playtime, so little variety, and so few options cannot be considered great--at any price point. If you're hell-bent on seeing a bunch of explosions, you'll find some things to like about Desert Thunder. If you're looking for anything more substantial, look elsewhere.   "
2121,Dead Sky,2.0,0,"  The game's menu greets you with ill-suited blaring rock music that doesn't fit the tone of the game that follows. (When you're trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, your first step is probably not to turn on a soaring guitar solo to draw attention to yourself and your roving gang of gunmen.) The single-player campaign is a quick six-mission distraction to introduce you to the core multiplayer action, with only two missions actually reflecting that core experience. The game opens up with you defending your buddy's escape plan (his car) from a meager offering of slow-moving, mostly nonthreatening undead. Once the car starts, you must drive away on a long street littered with zombies just waiting for you to plow them over. The mission is failable, but only if you come to a complete stop. And though the road is winding, you can drive straight until the very end for one final turn in order to beat the stage. Once you come to the end of the street, the game introduces you to a caricature hillbilly who tinkers in scrap metal (the game's resource) in order to turn it into more usable forms, like a gun turret or a strange bug zapper that stuns the encroaching zombie horde. Wyatt, the aforementioned redneck, isn't a humorous portrayal at all; he's simply an overacted representation of Southern stereotypes. This character is grating, and he's present throughout the multiplayer game. The campaign attempts to get to survival shooter roots with a trip through the zombie-infested sewers, but because the zombies are uniformly spaced apart, there's almost no tension in the journey. The sewers play more like an attempt at capturing the gameplay of an action role-playing game like Diablo or Torchlight (minus any exciting character skills) than a shooter, and the randomized weapon drops further push the game in that direction. You don't find weapons in preset locations; they drop randomly from the zombies. Their temporary boost in power is great, except that the amazing power of the rocket launcher and railgun is wasted in a sewer with no more than two to three zombies approaching you at a time. There's no epic carnage or cathartic mega-corpse explosion extravaganza.       "
1495,Grand Ages: Medieval,5.0,1,"I knew this was what Grand Ages offered going in. I knew that the game focused on economic and diplomatic power and even went so far as to discourage military intervention beyond basic self-defense. I was excited to see a game try to focus on more subtle definitions of power. What I played, however, was possibly the dullest iteration of this. Grand Ages attempts to build itself on an intricate web of economic systems, but it reduces the nuance of finance and politics into convoluted trade networks and one-dimensional diplomacy.You begin the game as a merchant, but your goal is far more ambitious: to bring the entirety of Europe under your control. To accomplish this, you need to first manage and optimize smaller regions and townships. Small settlements have limited capabilities, so to spur economic growth, you lash cities together with roads and keep them alive with an army of traders to keep the money flowing. This is Grand Ages’ best conceit.The limited capabilities of any given town incentivizes cooperation on a massive scale. You get your metals from one place, your coal from another, use both to forge tools in a third, and then sell them to the highest bidder in your best port. Supply lines, not armies, are your primary weapons. Crashing the economy of nearby rivals before flooding their markets with your cheap goods isn’t just possible: it’s one of the only ways you can expand your territory.For a strategy game that funnels everything through the lens of economics, Grand Ages is disappointing because it over-complicates the management process.This leads to a pattern of building momentum followed by rapid expansion. You build up stockpiles in your cities before demanding that other nations submit to you and your merchant fleets. Then you can rework and retool the new trade routes you control to grow your profits. Conceptually, this is incredible. This flow gives nods to the real historic importance of trade and financiers in the creation of the global society we see today. But Grand Ages fumbles the execution.For a strategy game that funnels everything through the lens of economics, Grand Ages is disappointing because it over-complicates the management process. You can set your traders, for example, to automatically choose when to buy and sell which goods to maximize profits or help boost the material production of local businesses. It's a great feature, but each town can only support one trader, so you need to be careful about their routes and monitor where they're buying what and for how much. Grand Ages doesn't make the task easy for you. Production costs for goods can vary based on a number of conditions, and that can have a huge impact on whether or not your empire is making money. Instead of making that information easy to understand, Grand Ages puts it all into one field. This is confusing, and it makes it difficult to make easy decisions.Balancing budgets can also be tedious. Once, I expanded a bit too much, and as my economy began to crash I turned to my balance sheet to see where all my cash was going and whether any markets were still turning a profit. I could see broad categories--I was spending a large amount on building maintenance-- but not the specifics I needed to start turning things around. Because the prices of goods are always in flux, the general balance sheet you see is never accurate enough to base your decisions on. You could cut excess coal production and boost your pastry output, expecting a boon only to dip further into the red the very next week. It makes for an unstable economic base, and rather than feeling in control of a situation, you're always at the whims of an unpredictable system that's difficult to decipher.Rather than feeling in control of a situation, you're always at the whims of an unpredictable system that's difficult to decipher.Things get even worse when your economy has completely tanked. You can't borrow money to get enough cash to make investments in new businesses to bring it back. Instead, you have to shed production and overhead, undoing hours of work. I enjoy balancing spreadsheets, and I love planning and organizing, but Grand Ages gives you a lot to do but too little information to make informed decisions. It's a struggle to keep anything aloft.Battles and wars are dull, and when the economy starts slipping, you won't be able to maintain an effective military. The morale of your troops drops so fast and the effects are so crippling that soldiers carry little value.You can exercise some level of soft power through well-managed trade routes, but there's little in the way of political deal brokering. There's nothing mimicking the complexities of swapping nobles and royals to secure trading rights, and that leaves you with no stakes. The best way to conquer a city is to trade a lot, establish yourself in the region, and ultimately pay for ownership outright. Grand Ages doesn't offer much pushback at that point; once you have the gold, you're set.As time went on, I didn’t get the sense that I was becoming better at the game so much as I was smashing my head into walls until they relented. And that’s a shame because Grand Ages has so much potential, and it does one thing--trade--really well. But there’s nothing to support that core, and the more you play, the more you run into roadblocks. For a game that needs to present information clearly and effectively, it fails to do so, and this failure has an unfortunate ripple effect on the rest of the game."
4499,Dark Angel (2002),4.0,0,"When Radical Entertainment began work on a PlayStation 2 adaptation of the sci-fi television series Dark Angel last year, the show was a hot property. The allure of sultry leading lady Jessica Alba and the presence of James Cameron as producer and cocreator turned it into a pop-culture phenomenon. But it didn't last. The show flared out in record time, vanishing from the airwaves for good last spring after just two seasons in production. Alba moved on to a movie career, and Cameron went back to polishing the Oscars he won for Titanic.   Radical, however, was stuck creating a game for a defunct TV show. And it shows. Although it's impossible to say whether or not the developers' morale was affected by the cancellation of the series, this third-person action adventure plays like it was cranked out to fulfill a contract. Gameplay is a mix of elements from the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Splinter Cell, although Dark Angel lacks the enthusiasm of the former and the exacting challenge of the latter. The unfulfilling combat system and poorly implemented stealth mode turn up the frustration factor to a level where even the most die-hard Alba fan will turn back to reruns rather than finish this game.   About the only aspects of Dark Angel that might hold a fan's interest are the story and setting, which seem to have been lifted from the series in their entirety. You play as Alba's Max, a genetically engineered supersoldier looking to find her siblings and carve out a new life in postapocalyptic Seattle. Helping her in these tasks is Logan Cale, an ""underground cyber-journalist"" looking to expose corruption. The corruption that you're taking on here is the -I- Corporation, a company trying to speed along its research into genetic engineering by capturing Max, a prime specimen of such science.   However, the plot is meaningless once you start playing. Max is voiced by Alba, and series regular Michael Weatherly returns as Logan, but the story is so generic that the identities of the actors don't matter. Almost every level sees Max stranded in a run-down city district, with only occasional communiqués from Logan to assist her in getting to safety. Level design consists of little more than ruined streets, gates that can be opened with keycards, and barrels that must be blown up with a lighter to expose an exit. You always know exactly where to go and what to do. The developers practically lead you by the hand from one plot point to the next, going so far as to highlight the object you need to use whenever you get close to the location where you need to use it.   Also along for the ride is the usual assortment of bad guys ready to beat you into submission. Your best bet is of course to beat them up first, which is possible thanks to the initially intriguing combat system. As a supersoldier, Max can pull off a lot of comic-book moves. Along with basic punches and kicks, she can do flying backflips off walls, spinning uppercuts, roundhouse right crosses, and grappling maneuvers like a pro wrestler. Attacks are emphasized by the use of a Max Payne-like camera that freezes Max in midstride as she delivers a devastating flurry and then returns to regular speed as the victim is hurtled in the opposite direction.   But as engaging and as attractive as combat in Dark Angel can be in isolated instances, it never changes. Repetition is a big problem, and there is little challenge in fighting here. You can slap around virtually any enemy in the game in a one-on-one scrap, so most battles are wild melees where you're engaged with around half a dozen foes. Yet even these fights aren't much of a challenge. Combination moves are ridiculously easy to activate, as most involve nothing more elaborate than pressing the punch or kick button numerous times in succession. Employing the powerful spin uppercut, for example, takes just four quick presses of the punch button, while using the killer spin kick takes just four quick presses of the kick button. Although there are more elaborate combos available, especially when you whip Max into a fighting fury by maxing out the rage bar, you just don't need them to hammer the challengers into submission. Simply engaging in unthinking button mashing does just as good a job of taking out the bad guys as does executing planned moves. You get the feeling that Radical dumbed down the combat system for the benefit of those drawn to playing this game solely because of the Dark Angel license.  Still, that doesn't explain away all of Radical's questionable design decisions. Cozying up to casual gamers certainly doesn't clarify the reasoning behind the stealth mode. Many levels feature sections where you have to use the L2 button to slink up behind guards and knock them out before reinforcements arrive. This is a noble idea that would have gone a long way toward livening up the dull action mode, but it wasn't well thought out. Most importantly, the interface doesn't support sneaking around. You have a danger bar that changes color when you're in danger of being spotted, although it goes so quickly from green to red that there is no chance to get back under cover after the enemies have gotten a glimpse of you. Once you're seen, you're attacked immediately. And you might as well restart the level as soon as you're noticed, because at this point a timer begins to count down the few moments until overwhelming reinforcements arrive to take you into custody. If you haven't defeated all of the foes on the map before the timer hits zero, you automatically lose. Expect to lose a lot unless you're near the end of the level when first attacked, as you always face the near-impossible task of taking out five or six enemies in little more than a minute.   Other problems with stealth mode are caused by the graphical engine. Although you can swivel the camera around with the right analog stick, it has an aversion to walls. Whenever you're trying to sneak by patrolling guards along a wall, it's impossible to tell where they are and whether or not they're looking in your direction, because the camera won't fully angle outward. Climbing ladders presents you with another blind spot. Ascend to one of the landings where power-ups are generally deposited, and you are prevented from moving the camera at all. So if you climb up from an area that's being patrolled, you have to just cross your fingers and hope that a guard isn't looking your way when you decide to climb down. Overall, sneaking around involves more pure chance than skill. The only mark in your favor here is dumb AI that frequently allows you to take out soldiers in plain view of their comrades.   Presentation values mirror the basement-level production of the Dark Angel television series. Virtually every level depicts what looks to be the same desolate Seattle street scene, with identical burning police cars and garbage blocking intersections. A lot of art and objects have been reused, such as the dumpster that you can close with a kick and the ubiquitous video game crates. Max herself looks reasonably good and is suitably animated, although her opposition is formed from just five or six character models. Most are soldiers, although as the game wears on you encounter different tough guys and some genetically altered humans. Also, load times are extremely long. Expect to wait nearly a minute to load a save, which is inexcusable in this case because much of the exact same art is loaded in each and every level. Audio hasn't been handled any better. Alba and Weatherly deliver their lines with the emotional impact of an automated voice-mail system. Most of Alba's contributions are stock action-movie one-liners or double entendres geared toward her adolescent male fans, and frankly, they're embarrassing.   Finally--not that this is really a complaint considering the quality of the game--Dark Angel can be finished at the default difficulty setting in just an evening of play. All in all, the development of this game probably should have been canceled at the same time as the television series upon which it is based. Questionable design decisions, terrible implementation, and the apparent lack of faith in a project doomed long before its completion make for a game that is more frustration than fun. "
3787,Maximum Pool,5.0,1,"With a name like Maximum Pool, you'd expect Sierra's Dreamcast pool game to contain an awful lot of pool. But the name Maximum Pool is a bit of false advertising. While Maximum Pool definitely packs in a lot of pool, it by no means contains the maximum amount of pool. Instead, Maximum Pool is a standard pool game with overly simplified control and fewer game modes than most other pool games on the market. Maximum Pool's only saving grace is its online play.   Maximum Pool contains only a few different modes. You can play exhibition, practice, and online games. A quickstart mode lets you pick up with the same game type and opponents as the preceding game. Picking exhibition lets you play several pool variants, such as straight pool, eight ball, nine ball, and cutthroat, with either human or computer opponents. There are five opponents to choose from, but the only major difference between the opponents is what faces pop up between shots to give you encouragement. Amy seems unsure of her ability, but she loves the game. Brad says nice shot, but he does so while gulping uneasily, as if losing would seal his fate. Buddy... well, Buddy is a dog. He barks at you between shots. Beating the computer opponents on the different difficulty settings can unlock other, more obscure games, such as 24 cents, a game played on an oddly shaped table.   Graphically, Maximum Pool isn't much to look at. The balls are round, the table looks OK, and you can rotate the camera angle around at will. The different backgrounds are pretty unimpressive, and the game gets pretty choppy on hard breaks. The music isn't very good, but Maximum Pool manages to sound just like a real pool table - balls hitting off each other clack rather loudly and so on.   The default setting shows small dotted lines connecting the end of the cue and the object balls. It has a distance limit, so long shots are harder to line up, but more often than not, there's no question when it comes to aiming your shots. The computer seems to use this logic as well, as it can run a table full of easy shots, even on its most novice setting. This makes most of Maximum Pool a pretty brainless encounter. There's no timing involved in hitting the balls, either - simply push up and down on the D-pad to select your shot strength and hit A to take the shot.   The game's obvious draw is its online play. As something like pool isn't terribly taxing on a modem connection, the game is essentially lag free, and it's just as good as playing with a person next to you. You can send chat messages back and forth, a feature that is made a million times easier with the Dreamcast keyboard. Maximum Pool DC is compatible with the PC and Mac versions of the game, giving you a much wider online audience to choose from.    Maximum Pool doesn't really max out the Dreamcast in any way, shape, or form. But then, Average Pool wouldn't be nearly as inviting a title. If you're looking for something to play online, Maximum Pool does the job, albeit without any bells or whistles."
3616,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team,5.0,1,"  Lovers of all things Pokémon are bound to be disappointed by Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, as are those looking for a role-playing game to play on their preferred Nintendo handheld. For starters, it isn't even a true Pokémon game. Nintendo and ChunSoft have simply taken a dungeon hack that ChunSoft has produced for numerous other publishers in the past and integrated the Pokémon franchise's characters and a few of its key concepts into it. The real kicker, though, is that ChunSoft's game wasn't that good to begin with, and the injection of Pokémon elements hasn't done a thing to change that.          ChunSoft has been churning out Mystery Dungeon games for various publishers since the early 1990s. Although most were published only in Japan, a couple have made their way to North America, including Chocobo's Dungeon 2 and Torneko: The Last Hope, both for the Sony PlayStation. Like those games, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon has you exploring randomly generated dungeons and fighting the monsters inside them in a manner that combines real-time movement with some of the nuances of turn-based games. In a nutshell, every time you take a step or perform an action, the enemies in the dungeon also take a step or perform an action. You command a party of as many as four Pokémon. You have direct control over the lead Pokémon's actions, but the CPU controls the other characters. For the most part, what happens in the dungeons is all of the usual stuff that you'd expect from a dungeon hack. You can perform close-up or ranged attacks, throw rocks and iron scraps at enemies from afar, and pick up any items that happen to be sitting around. Pokémon become stronger and learn new attacks as they gain experience, various items can be collected and used, and gold can be collected for later spending in the village. Also, like every ChunSoft dungeon hack, this game has a hunger meter. If you don't occasionally eat an apple or a seed, you'll faint and leave the dungeon.     Suffice it to say, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon has more in common with a litany of dungeon hacks than it does with any of Nintendo's traditional Pokémon role-playing games. Whereas a typical Pokémon game has a large overworld with multiple environments populated with hundreds of villagers and Pokémon, this game has only a single small overworld village populated by a few chatty Pokémon and a handful of useful shops. Everything of note, whether it's recruiting additional Pokémon or fighting legendary Pokémon, happens in any of the game's 16 or so dungeons. The game explains away its deviations from the usual Pokémon blueprint through its story. You assume the role of a human who has been transformed into a Pokémon and whisked off to a disaster-plagued continent populated by wild Pokémon. After arriving in a tiny forest, you are greeted by another Pokémon and you both decide to form a rescue team. The purpose of a rescue team is to help other Pokémon that have somehow become trapped in dungeons. This serves as all the excuse the game needs to constantly send you into dungeons, as Pokémon are constantly delivering mission requests to your mailbox. The overall story, which can take anywhere from 15 to 20 hours to complete, also pulls you into dungeons to quell legendary Pokémon to get to the bottom of why the world is currently falling apart.          Key Pokémon aspects have been incorporated into the game to varying degrees. Since there are no trainers around, you can't add new Pokémon to your team by capturing them. Instead, the wild Pokémon you defeat in battle will sometimes offer to join your rescue team. In a traditional Pokémon game, the Pokémon in your party evolve once they have reached a certain level. Here, evolution isn't even an option until you finish the main story. And once it does become an option, it's simply a choice you can make by visiting a specific cave. The major share of evolved Pokémon can be recruited during the normal course of the game. The process of teaching Pokémon new attacks, on the other hand, works almost exactly as it does in standard Pokémon games. Pokémon learn new attacks when they reach certain levels, or you can use rare TM items to teach them attacks whenever you like. This game also lets you link multiple attacks together during a single turn. Rounding out the list of key Pokémon aspects that made it into the game are elemental affinities, which also function much the way Pokémon veterans are familiar with. Water Pokémon are strong against fire Pokémon, ghost Pokémon are strong against psychic Pokémon, and so forth. In some dungeons, weather conditions can also hinder or help your Pokémon.     While the inclusion of characters and aspects from the Pokémon franchise serves to give Pokémon Mystery Dungeon a familiar and friendly atmosphere, it doesn't do much to address the weaknesses in ChunSoft's original dungeon hack. Chiefly, the design is overly simplistic and gets old really fast. Each dungeon typically has anywhere from 10 to 30 floors, which all recycle the same bland background tiles and contain the same three or four wild Pokémon. Although you can perform four different attacks, in practice you'll stick to the same reliable move and watch the same battles play out over and over again. There's a tinge of strategy involving the orientation of your Pokémon in relation to the enemy during battle, but what this boils down to is that it's best to have an ally next to you so you can double-team enemies. Wild Pokémon aren't aggressive as it is, and they don't do much to exploit obvious weaknesses. Making matters worse, the CPU has control over the backup Pokémon on the team, which takes yet another layer of control out of your hands. In some cases, particularly boss battles, you can let the CPU do all the work. Dungeon hacks are repetitive by nature, but this one takes sameness too far. Incredibly, aspects that would have made the game more interesting, such as traps, the ability to dig, and the ability to choose leaders, are in the game, but they don't become available until you've already completed the main story. Other flaws, such as randomly generated layouts that place an exit right next to your entry point, or the glitchy CPU artificial intelligence that sometimes sends your allies prancing off in the opposite direction, don't help.      Nintendo and ChunSoft also didn't do much to spruce up the game's production values. Not that any Pokémon game has ever pushed a system's hardware, but the graphics and audio in this one fall somewhere between the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance in terms of quality. The small overworld village and friend areas, where you spend hardly any time, are lush and colorful and flaunt animated water and haze effects. By contrast, the dungeons, where you languish for dozens of hours, are put together with repetitive tilesets that employ barely any color or animation. The Pokémon themselves aren't very animated, except for footsteps and some choppy attack motions, but at least they're colorful and cute. As for the accompanying audio, it's nothing special. The different tunes are upbeat, but they loop incessantly, and the sound effects and Pokémon cries have a static buzz that makes it seem like they were ripped out of the original GBC Pokémon games. About the only thing developers got totally right in terms of production value is the story, which is charming and mushy like Pokémon stories are supposed to be. On the whole, the game feels dated. Worse, since the DS version contains all of the same graphics and audio as the GBA game, it seems downright ancient compared to games that have been developed exclusively for that system.          As it often does for Pokémon games, Nintendo has produced two corresponding versions of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. This time around, however, one is available for the Game Boy Advance, and the other is available for the Nintendo DS. The story and characters in both games are identical, although each version contains a half-dozen Pokémon that aren't readily available in its counterpart. If you plan to get the game and have a choice of Blue Rescue Team or Red Rescue Team, you should opt for the Blue Rescue Team version on the DS. It doesn't look or sound any better than the GBA game, but the system's twin screens and touch-screen capability make it easier to stay informed and navigate the various menus. Health, status, and item indicators are constantly visible on the DS's top screen, while the lower screen displays the same top-down dungeon viewpoint and map overlay as the GBA game. The DS game also lets you open menus, make choices, and select enemies simply by tapping the stylus in the appropriate spots on the touch screen.      Two features exclusive to the Nintendo DS version are the dojo visit and the unknown dungeon modes. The dojo visit mode takes advantage of both cartridge slots in the DS to let you import the team from Red Rescue Team into the Blue Rescue Team version for battles at the dojo in the village. Unfortunately, this isn't a true multiplayer function, as the CPU controls the visiting team. The other DS-exclusive mode is called unknown dungeon. It works just like the bark mode in Nintendogs. Selecting the unknown dungeon menu item will place your DS into a low power state and have it search for other Blue Rescue Team games nearby that have also been put into the unknown dungeon state. When your DS gets close to another DS containing the Blue Rescue Team game, your Pokémon will automatically visit dungeons in the other person's game and bring back rare items.         Nintendo, of course, would prefer that you pick up both versions or convince one of your friends to pick up the version that you passed on. The incentive is that people with both games can take advantage of various connectivity features, such as the ability to share items and trade missions that unlock the few Pokémon that are normally exclusive to a particular version. The only way to recruit all 387 pocket monsters is to trade between the two versions. You can also call a friend for help or answer your friend's call for a rescue. Indeed, when your team is knocked out in a dungeon, you have the option to send a rescue request to your friend. If your friend accepts the request, he or she can journey to the corresponding spot in his or her game where you were knocked out and revive you with all of your loot intact. After the rescue, your friend can even choose to give you a Pokémon to fortify your squad. Friends can send and receive rescue requests and items in a myriad of ways. Two copies of the DS game can initiate a wireless link, two copies of the GBA game can initiate a cable link, the DS and GBA games can share data when both versions are plugged into a single DS, or you can use passwords to send items and requests between any two versions of the game. Passwords are a pain to input, though, since they're a whopping 54 characters in length. Sadly, the game doesn't appear to interface with any other Pokémon games.     No matter how much you claim to love Pokémon, you should probably skip Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. It may contain plenty of recognizable Pokémon creatures and incorporate some of the franchise's key concepts, but it's nowhere near as diverse, slick, or fun as the canonical Pokémon role-playing games produced by Game Freak. Odds are that even staunch fans of the dungeon hack genre will find this game far too simplistic and repetitive for their tastes.     "
1434,The Deadly Tower of Monsters,6.0,1,"The conceit of The Deadly Tower of Monsters is that you are watching a DVD of a film of the same name with commentary from director Dan Smith. Nearly every action you take is accompanied by maniacal comments from the director. The film itself follows the travails of Dick Starspeed and his two companions--an alien woman and his robot servant--as they try to overthrow an evil emperor exploiting an alien world for material gain while they climb a seemingly infinitely tall tower. It never goes any deeper.Thankfully, looking at The Deadly Tower of Monsters never ceases to be a delight; it relishes in its artificiality, to great effect. Giant robots are clearly re-purposed vacuum cleaners. You can see the strings holding the pterodactyls in the air. The killer primates' costumes look more fake than those worn by the crew in the original Planet of the Apes. Every visual element looks like it was assembled from spare trash lying around the studio. What this game may lack in polygon counts, it makes up in sheer dedication to a cohesive, charming style.It's a shame, then, that playing The Deadly Tower of Monsters is never half that entertaining. The game's mix of twin-stick shooting and melee-focused combat rarely strays far from ""mindlessly murdering everything around you."" The only tactical consideration is the limited energy meter for your ranged weapon, but because you have efficient melee options, it's almost never an issue. Once you've killed the same enemies a couple dozen times, combat begins to feel like you're simply going through the motions, and the game's limited customization and upgrade system for your stats and gear does little to alleviate the tedium.It's also disappointing that a game that so clearly exemplifies the visual dynamics of trashy classic science fiction doesn't have anything deeper to say about the form. For the majority of its campaign, The Deadly Tower of Monsters is just a bad science fiction story; that this was largely intentional doesn't make the story any less bad. Though the director's commentary gimmick hangs some lampshades on the silliness of it all, we live in an age in which films like Galaxy Quest, Planet Terror, and The Big Lebowski have proven that satire can elevate its source material, rather than simply ape it.As I trudged through one meaningless combat encounter after another, I found some solace in the things that surrounded me. The vibrant and tactile world is charming, and it was impressive to see the stories and enemies of hours past rushing upwards as I plummeted from the tower. While the stylistic appeal of science fiction schlock may be niche, The Deadly Tower of Monsters has silly sights that effectively recall the iconic parts of the works that inspired it, if not much else."
3058,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,6.0,1,"      The campaign is spread across seven chapters, each one focusing on a different Transformer (or, in one case, two Transformers). When in robot form, you have a few different weapons and abilities available, and the unique abilities of each Transformer lend the action a bit of variety from chapter to chapter. Mirage, for instance, has a cloaking ability and a sniper rifle, and Megatron can drain health from nearby Autobots. But these abilities aren't significant enough to prevent the action from falling into a rut as a result of the repetitive and uninspired level design. You spend most of your time walking or rolling your way through levels, pausing frequently to blast generic robots of the opposing faction. On very rare occasions, you need to do things a bit differently, such as in one section as Mirage during which you have only the cloaking ability and melee attacks at your disposal. But for the most part, there's nothing that makes one battle significantly different from the next. You fight the same standard enemies in similar environments over and over.           In addition to the campaign, Dark of the Moon has a multiplayer mode. Here, the Transformers are divided up into four classes. There are speedy scouts, airborne hunters, well-rounded commanders, and hard-hitting warriors. There are only three game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Conquest, in which teams earn points for controlling nodes. As in so many multiplayer games these days, you earn experience and level up, unlocking new perks (like faster speed on foot, or an automatic grenade drop when killed) and new abilities (like a healing ability, or a temporary boost to armor and damage for all nearby allies). Battles tend to be chaotic, with lots of players shooting and clobbering each other at close quarters. They're good for some quick and shallow Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots fun, but they lack the depth to keep you coming back for long. You level up very quickly and can earn every ability for every class in a handful of hours. With shallow action, just three basic modes of play, and five maps, this multiplayer quickly loses its appeal.    "
819,FIFA 19,5.0,1,"If FIFA 19 on PS4 and Xbox One is a 40-piece orchestra with all the bells and whistles you can think of, then FIFA 19 on Nintendo Switch is the tribute band. The Switch version of EA's footballing behemoth purports to have all the same qualities--the Champions League! Ultimate Team! Career Mode!--but under the surface, each of its many facets lacks the depth and longevity from other versions. On the pitch the Switch port feels relatively smooth, if a little dated, but it's hard to shake off the feeling you're playing an inferior and incomplete version of this year's biggest soccer sim.Some improvements from the PS4 and Xbox One editions carry over to the Switch port, such as timed finishing and the new Kick Off house rules options like No Rules and Survival Mode. Others, such as game plans--or any kind of tactical tweaks or player instructions--do not make the cut.Once you get on the pitch, things feel satisfying--sometimes. Passing still feels imprecise, even with the world's best players, but shooting and dribbling feel almost as good as what's available on other platforms. But this port also seems to pull from older versions of FIFA--many cutscenes and environmental cues like those read out by stadium announcers are from as far back as FIFA 10.Additional problems crop up when you want to play a friend with one Joy-Con each. It works, but not particularly well. As with FIFA 18 on Switch, fewer buttons and sticks means there's no way to use finesse shots, threaded through balls, knuckle shots, manual defending, skill moves, or driven passes. Double-tapping the right bumper allows you to knock the ball ahead of you in a similar fashion to the right stick when playing with traditional controls, but similar workarounds don't exist for the other missing functions. Playing with one Joy-Con is possible but often ends up feeling like more hassle than it's worth. You are, at least, able to matchmake with friends when playing online, which was missing from last year's Switch port.The Champions League license and standalone mode do form a part of the Switch version, complete with Derek Rae's Aberdeen-Atlantic commentary and UEFA's operatic anthem. Night games look impressive on Switch, even if the atmospheres don't quite live up to the sights and sounds of the PS4 and Xbox One editions, in part due to lower resolution. The standalone mode is essentially a stripped-down version of Career Mode, which itself is even more bare-bones on Switch than it is on home consoles this year. On Switch, neither mode contains the dynamic cutscenes or interactive transfer negotiations found on other platforms. Here, FIFA 19 really does feel very similar to 18, just with updated licenses.Ultimate Team has a similar story in this version. FUT is easily FIFA's biggest and most popular mode, thanks in large part to EA's Squad Building Challenges, in-form cards, and more live services that keep things fresh. All those are present and correct on Switch, but the mode is lacking in ways to actually use your squad. Division Rivals, FUT's new sub-mode for this year on PS4 and Xbox One, is nowhere to be found, meaning you have to make do with standard old Online Seasons matches. Squad Battles, the primary method of play for offline players in FUT, is also absent--the more miserly Single Player Seasons are your best bet here. To make matters worse, you still need a constant internet connection to access even Ultimate Team's single-player sections, so playing FUT on the go isn't an option unless you tether your Switch to your phone signal. Oh, and the FIFA 19 companion app is not compatible with Switch versions of the game, so you're out of luck there, too.All that's left is to lament the ongoing absence of The Journey, which of all FIFA's modes appears the best fit for Switch--a deep, offline story playable in small chunks--and yet it's omitted entirely from the port. And that sums up the Switch version of FIFA 19: a playable, competent game of football encased in a package of outdated modes and lacking the controls and features you really want."
1982,Dark Souls II,9.0,2," If you were disappointed by the less-than-exemplary PC port of the original Dark Souls, you'll be glad to know that Dark Souls II for the PC fares far better, featuring graphical settings and resolution options that befit a proper PC game. Otherwise, Dark Souls II for the PC looks similar to its console counterparts, and its mouse and keyboard controls are comfortable and intuitive enough to make the game a good bet for PC players that don't own gamepads. All told, Dark Souls II is every bit the same superb game that appeared on console last month, and deserves respect for its diverse world and nail-biting challenge. - KV, 4/24/2014 15:00 PDT How much of your humanity are you willing to give up for even the slightest chance of victory? Dark Souls II asks this question of you at every turn, encouraging you to press onward in spite of imminent death. And with each death, you lose a little of your humanity and become more hollow. Your maximum health slightly diminishes each time as well, eventually sinking to 50 percent of its full value, and yet as each sliver of humanity is sliced away, you heed the call to move onward. Eventually, you overcome the obstacle that stood between you and victory--that quartet of gargoyles swarming you on a rooftop, that arachnoid demon plunging poisonous pincers into your flesh, that disgusting mound of meat that defies description. You have triumphed! But your gain does not come without sacrifice. You have sworn, you have gasped, and you have sweated. You have forfeited your own humanity so you might collect the souls of the damned. Dark Souls and Demon's Souls before it, Dark Souls II is not just a fantasy role-playing adventure, but a cloud that hangs heavy over your head whenever you so much as think about it. These modern classics developed by From Software have rightfully earned a reputation for being brutally difficult, but their beauty is derived not solely from difficulty, but also from dread. Dark Souls II is not a survival horror game in the normal sense, but few games can make you this afraid to peer around the corner, while simultaneously curious as to what awaits you there. Death is so very beautiful in this game, for it comes at the hands of amazing beasts and warmongers: hulking armored knights, shimmering otherworldly invaders, and tendrils that rise out of black pools of poison. Sure, each death punctures your heart, but one of Dark Souls II's many gruesome pleasures is discovering new ways to die. The eerie blackness is front and center as you start up the game and enter the mysterious abode in front of you. Three old crones await you inside and ask you to customize your character and choose a class before venturing into the unknown. Like most of Dark Souls II's characters, these women offer vague advice and refer to events and concepts without filling in the details. The anxiety mounts as you weave in and out of the nearby caverns that fill you in on the basics of movement and combat. This area may teach you the fundamentals, but it also raises a number of questions. What are those odd voices you hear when you stand near the bird's nest that rests on a narrow ledge? What is the significance of the flame sconces scattered about that you are meant to set alight? How do you survive encounters with the monstrous ogres on the beach below that squish you like a measly bug when you draw near? Welcome to Drangleic, a world that is not quick to whisper its secrets to you, in a game that trusts you to find the answers for yourself. This introduction is not as soul crushing as the original Dark Souls' opening, but that's just fine, for Dark Souls II offers you an early taste of hope, a feeling that was quite rare in its predecessors. That hope arrives by way of Majula, a gorgeous oasis that's as close to a home as you will find in the game. My first glimpse of Majula was a revelation. As I emerged from the nearby shadows, the glowing sun blinded me, and I stood in awe of the world opening up before me. Whenever the bleakness of Drangleic at large overwhelmed me, I was glad to return to this hub for an emotional refresh. Majula is more akin to Demon's Souls' Nexus than to Dark Souls' Firelink Shrine. It is your central hub of operations, and while it's mostly devoid of life when you first come upon it, it slowly fills out with the vendors you meet upon your travels, many of whom set up shop there. Your most important contact there, however, is the cloaked woman who allows you to level up in exchange for souls, the game's currency. But even Majula is not immune to mystery. There's an impossibly deep hole in the ground here, one that spells certain death if you fall into it. (Don't let it fool you; the boards that crisscross this passage may look high enough to provide a safe landing, but you will not survive that fall.) What's down there? Surely something valuable must lurk down there. Or something horrifying. You eventually make your way down, but Dark Souls II doesn't tell you when or how that may happen. Death is so very beautiful in this game, for it comes at the hands of amazing beasts and warmongers: hulking armored knights, shimmering otherworldly invaders, and tendrils that rise out of black pools of poison. Instead, Dark Souls II trusts you. As in its predecessors, there are no waypoints, and there is no quest log. Instead, you simply head out into Drangleic seeking to light primal bonfires and thus restore some dignity to this decrepit land. The only way to defeat the defiant creatures that guard the bonfires, however, is to grow stronger by murdering enemies and collecting their souls, which you then spend on new levels, new armor, and other trinkets that strengthen your resolve in battle. If you've played the earlier Souls games, you should take to the combat quickly. You feel each swing of your axe, each stab with your spear, and each fireball you lob. Timing is key: every action leaves you vulnerable, so you must pay close attention to the rhythm of your enemies' attacks and strike at the opportune moment. Managing your stamina is also vital to success. Every attack you launch uses up stamina, as does successfully blocking an attack. You can't simply flail about with abandon; this is not that kind of game, and not taking care during every encounter will get you killed. Not that you shouldn't expect death. Dark Souls II is built around your repeated demise. When that inevitable moment comes, you drop all the souls you were carrying and must retrieve them if you don't want to lose them permanently. You get only one chance to get them back, for dying before you reach them eliminates them from the world forever. Of course, this mechanic is nothing new: it's the same concept that powered both Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, after all. But just as Dark Souls represented a structural change over Demon's Souls, so too does Dark Souls II over its predecessor. Some of the differences are noticeable early on, though their benefits aren't always immediately clear. I was not sure how I felt about one such change: the limited enemy respawns. Each time you die or rest at a bonfire, the world is refreshed and the standard defeated foes respawn. Or at least, that's how it used to happen. In Dark Souls II, there comes a point when many local enemies don't respawn anymore, allowing you freedom to progress with fewer obstacles in your way. It's true that infinite respawns encouraged grinding, particularly when the enemies you faced dropped important items. But that repetition also instilled a bizarre connection between player and game. I can still clearly remember, for instance, exactly how to progress through Dark Souls' Undead Parish--where each enemy is, what attacks it will use, and what precarious drop-offs I must keep a lookout for. When I first encountered the limited respawn system, I worried that the sequel had lost a vital element that would keep Dark Souls II from commandeering my waking and sleeping thoughts. How much of your humanity are you willing to give up for even the slightest chance of victory? As it turns out, I shouldn't have worried. The grinding opportunities are still there, and there are in-game items that force enemies in a given region to begin respawning again (and make them more powerful, to boot). Dark Souls II's hook isn't the endless cycle of enemy death and resurrection, however, but the promise of new and exciting places to explore, and new and exciting foes to face. And that hook is supported by any number of subtle changes to the formula. For example, once you activate a bonfire, you can warp to it from any other bonfire without having to pass through perilous places over and over again. Again, I didn't immediately take to this change, but once I discovered just how vast Drangleic was--it's decidedly bigger than Dark Souls' Lordran--I embraced the structural tweaks. These changes might not have worked had Dark Souls II not made discovery such a thrill, but with each new area comes a new wondrous vista and a new challenge to overcome. The early forests and ruins are very Dark Souls, but the intricate architecture and carefully planned enemy locations make even familiar-looking environments fresh and unique. The more progress you make, however, the more unusual the settings become, and the more you need to consider new methods of approach. Suddenly, undead freaks are flinging themselves to the ground and exploding, and so you must hasten your rhythm. You walk through an archway and into the thickest fog imaginable, where you cannot lock on to the ghostly shimmers that attack you. Poison rains from the sky, bedeviled urns curse you when you linger near, and anthropomorphic tortoises stop, drop, and roll all over your puny body. Dark Souls II wants to kill you, but the cycle of death and rebirth is worth it if it means finding the royal ring that lets you open that giant door and discover what new and wonderful lands lie beyond it. Those lands are incredibly striking. Given reports of Dark Souls II's new engine, I was disappointed by the game's lighting, which was flatter than I had hoped, thus rendering my torch less vital for providing dynamic light than it might have otherwise been. But to fixate for too long on this single visual element sells the fantastic art design short. Make your way past Harvest Valley's poisonous pools--and the fantastic monstrosities that fire orbs of darkness at you--and you can only marvel at all of the windmills that lie before you. Of course, this is Drangleic and not the Netherlands; those windmills are not quaint landmarks, but harbingers of disease and death. Then there's Iron Keep, which takes lava levels to a whole new height of fiery doom. There are very occasional frame rate issues that intrude on the grim elegance, but nothing on par with Dark Souls' Blighttown struggles. Poison rains from the sky, bedeviled urns curse you when you linger near, and walking tortoises stop, drop, and roll all over your puny body. And so Dark Souls II is hard--but is it harder than the original? No. I certainly did my share of shouting while playing through Dark Souls II, pitting my bastard sword against Drangleic's powerful protectors, but nothing caused me controller-flinging frustration the way Dark Souls' Ornstein and Smough did. Nor did I ever snarl and growl the way I did when making my way through the original game's Sen's Fortress, let alone facing Demon's Souls' red dragon. But don't overestimate any rumors that Dark Souls II isn't a great challenge. Trudging my way through shin-deep water while avoiding nearby mages' magical homing missiles was not easy. I yelled when I slipped into a drop-off while focused on the mean wizards, and cursed when sea dwellers swiped me from behind while I blocked oncoming attacks. And then, finally, when I reached the foggy door that led to a new area, I was able to breathe--at least until I realized there was a gross boss monster behind that door. I must give credit to Dark Souls II for making combat feel as fair as it does. The Souls games have always given you the tools to succeed, but while playing the newest entry, I was impressed by how it balanced new challenges with subtle ways to help you succeed. Sometimes, the path to success is relatively obvious, like using a lever to dunk baddies in boiling lava, or luring an armored turtle under a blade and watching the makeshift guillotine slice the half-shelled villain in two. Other possibilities are so subtle as to be obtuse, rewarding thorough investigation with an unexpected boon. Is poison complicating a battle against an evil queen? Is darkness inhibiting your ability to lock on to a pouncing behemoth? There might be some help out there, just hidden from view. Dark Souls II trusts you to find it--or if not, to overcome without it. Just as before, help comes from other players as well as from the game itself. Every Dark Souls II player is intertwined in a comforting web of ambiguous communication. As before, you see the spirits of other players as they journey through their own copies of the grotesque wilderness. You teach them (or mislead them) by forming messages out of predetermined phrases and leaving them on the ground for others to spot. You even teach them with the mere act of dying, leaving a bloodstain that others might touch to witness your ghost reenact the last precious seconds of your life. And if you feel truly cooperative, you can offer your services to other players, who can then summon you in for assistance with a troublesome boss. You can also hinder other players by invading their worlds, just as before, though certain additions to online play keep battles more dynamic than ever. The notification that you have been invaded is still a stomach-churning event, as is the first sight of the red phantom that represents the other player. But your invader is not necessarily invulnerable to the undead soldiers that populate Drangleic--not if you use a particular item designed to make monsters turn on your human enemies. Luring an invader into a trap--look out for the creature with the scythe!--is an absolute delight, though you need to make sure you have your wits about you: the only thing scarier than seeing your evil intruder is not seeing him. There's so much more to talk about with Dark Souls II. There is the fantastic stretch near the end of the game that fleshes out the story by involving you in grander battles than you would expect from this series. Then there are the covenants--fellowships that bond you with other players and give you more tools to assist or annihilate each other. Joining one covenant allows other players to come to your aid should you be invaded; joining another lets you battle against characters from the original Dark Souls. How some of these covenants may change the very feel of the game is still unclear at this early stage, but having joined the Bell Keeper covenant, I look forward to being summoned to other worlds and preventing others from reaching the tops of their belfries and sounding out the bell that sways there. Dark Souls II is loaded with secrets and surprises, and even though I have finished the game once, there are so many elements I am still uncovering. I may not have yet unveiled all there is to know about this beastly game, even after 80 hours of play, but I do know this: I will be adventuring through Drangleic for many months to come, sure to be haunted nightly by the disturbing gazes of the faceless titans that tenderize my flesh with their two-ton hammers."
578,Phoenix Point,8.0,2,"You've earned the right to mess with the XCOM formula when you're the person chiefly responsible for it. Julian Gollop was the co-lead designer on the original XCOM: UFO Defense in 1994, and Phoenix Point, from Gollop's new studio Snapshot Games, is a self-described spiritual successor to XCOM. At first it feels all too familiar: You play the eponymous private military organisation defending Earth from an alien threat, patching holes in the sinking ship via tactical combat and strategic upgrades. But Phoenix Point reinvents the formula in both big and small ways, sending changes rippling across the strategic map and tinkering with the nuts and bolts of close combat. Not every new idea is equally successful, though many of them are welcome, and in sum deliver a refresh that points the genre in an exciting new direction.As with the first XCOM sequel, Terror from the Deep, the threat here comes from the ocean. A mysterious mist is creeping at the coast, luring people into the sea and returning them as Lovecraftian fish monsters--all scaly-skinned, newly betentacled, and packing crustaceous heat, an army of soldier crabs. Phoenix Point is joined in defending the planet by three ideologically distinct factions: New Jericho want to destroy the aliens, the Synedrion want to coexist with them, and the Disciples of Anu want to synthesize human and alien life. Many of the missions you undertake will inevitably involve offending at least one of the factions and so, no matter how impartial you to try to remain, eventually you're going to have to choose sides. It's a depressing, relevant example of humanity's failure to come together in the face of existential catastrophe.On the world map, presented here as it was in the original XCOM as the Geoscape, a rotatable globe pockmarked with scouted points of interest, the mist is a red miasma slowing enveloping the planet, a Doomsday Clock ticking closer to midnight one continent at a time. This strategic layer runs in real time as your Phoenix squads fly from one flashpoint to the next, while you work on increasing base capacity, manufacturing new arms, and researching new military solutions. All the while the red mist spreads, escalating the danger as new nests appear and strangling your ability to fight back as faction outposts fall. It's the perfect visual representation of the odds you're facing and the seeming inevitability of defeat. Despite the abstraction, it's genuinely painful to see the mist consume a settlement you had heroically rescued only days earlier.At a strategic level, Phoenix Point wants to let you pick your own path. The Geoscape is at the start shrouded in the fog of war. Through scanning nearby areas and aerial exploration it soon becomes a sprawling, cluttered morass of multi-coloured icons describing your own bases, factional havens, key quest destinations, potential scavenging sites, neutral colonies, alien nests, and other unidentified locations. You have considerable freedom in navigating your own route across this world. You can basically travel wherever you like and, when you arrive, you can usually decide whether or not to take on the mission you've encountered. Want to save this low-threat scavenging mission for some new recruits further down the line? Just hit abort and fly your veteran squad into more dangerous territory.It's liberating, at least early on, as you jet around, scouting the map, picking and choosing your next mission. Yet by the time you have multiple squads traversing the globe, and you're juggling a handful of different flight paths across a Geoscape that has exploded into a galaxy of competing icons, that liberation is swamped by confusion. It's not that it's hard to tell what you could do next--important story missions and factional quests are highlighted--it's more that there are so many things to do that it's easy to lose yourself in endless distractions or worse, drown under an overwhelming wave of map markers.Indeed, the chaotic, confounding clutter of the Geoscape is emblematic of some wider interface issues. The research screen throws every possible tech into a long list with scant attention given to how useful it might or where it might lead. There's a research order function, but you can only send one tech to the front of the queue, not adjust the order further down. Inventory management is a mess when it comes to comparing different weapons to equip and deciding which new gear to manufacture.The the freeform structure of the Geoscape guarantees no two campaigns will play out alike. What those campaigns have in common, however, is a mentally exhausted player. You're pulled in so many directions. Two colonies are under attack in India but an alien nest needs eradicating in Malaysia. New Jericho wants to assist its research in China but the Synedrion wants you to sabotage Jericho's research lab in Australia. And all the while there are dozens of unexplored spots in Africa that you haven't even visited yet. But it’s worth battling through the stress and clutter to get to the combat.What typically awaits at a destination is a bout of small-scale, turn-based combat. Occasionally you will stumble upon a simple narrative event that will give you a decision to make and readjust your resources or factional reputation in response, but for the most part, you will find yourself engaged in a firefight.At a combat level, Phoenix Point is all about tactical flexibility. There are four primary classes--heavy, assault, sniper, and melee--but perk trees are semi-randomly rolled for each soldier, and you can also allow them to multi-class. This means no two soldiers have to be the same, and you have a lot of room to tailor each six-person squad to suit your preferred style of play. My first heavy was the typical tank character, lots of health and a big cannon, but later adopted a secondary class and would jet pack onto a roof and launch a few grenades to destroy the enemy's cover before switching to a sniper rifle to finish them off.Many of the man-made structures on a map can be damaged and destroyed. Grenades and other heavy weapons can remove that pillar you were relying on for cover. Even the humble pistol can shoot through a thin wall, hitting anything that was on the other side and leaving them more exposed for a follow-up shot. My jet-packing heavy nearly bit the dust one time when the roof they'd landed on gave way in an explosion, dumping them into the room below where a nasty crab creature lurked. Fortunately, on the next turn, they were able to jetpack to safety out of the newly renovated ceiling.When you take a shot, you aren't given a percentage chance to hit while some dice are rolled to see if you did any damage. Instead, bullet trajectories are said to be physically simulated, meaning if you can see something, you can hit it. There are two ways to take a shot. The default has you aiming generally at the centre of the target's mass. Take an aimed shot, though, and you're given a first-person view where what you point at is what you'll shoot. You can target an enemy's limbs or their weapon or even another object in the environment, and for the most part you're likely to hit it. There is a degree of fuzziness here--you'll see the crosshair surrounded by two rings, the inner one indicating where most of the shot(s) will hit and the outer accounting for any remainder--and the accuracy and damage of any particular shot is still affected by the weapon's range and other stats. But it's very satisfying to destroy an enemy's shield with one well-aimed sniper shot, then follow it up with an assault rifle round to the now-exposed head.The ability to target specific limbs becomes vitally important as more diverse enemy types start populating the battlefield--you'll very quickly need to worry about more than those wielding shields. The sheer variety of enemy types and behaviours issues an interesting challenge every turn and have you constantly thinking about cover, height, range, support, supplies, teamwork and priorities. In addition, every enemy is susceptible to a well-aimed shot that cripples a specific limb, thus slowing its movement, nullifying its special ability, destroying its weapon or inhibiting its mode of attack. As a result there's so much more to think about in combat than just methodically moving your squad forward and shooting the enemy when they appear.The flexibility is heightened by the action point system that provides more options than just moving and shooting. Every soldier has 4 APs, but different weapons and abilities use different amounts, and the ground a soldier can cover in 1 AP is affected by their speed stat. Two of my assault troops worked in perfect tandem: one was a shotgun expert with the speed to close quickly on their target and use a debuff that reduced the APs of nearby hostiles, the other hung back a bit, offering support with their longer-range rifle, entering overwatch every turn thanks to its cheaper cost, and running in with a medkit if the other took damage. Both characters started out the same, but the wildly different level-up choices I made for them, coupled with the capacity to spend their APs every turn on a mostly unique suite of options, meant they felt distinct--like characters whose behaviour I had authored and who I was personally responsible for. I'd invested in their stats, tweaking them in parallel to become complementary, and as a result, had become emotionally invested in them.When you lose a soldier it hits hard, of course. Any soldier that goes down in a fight is permanently dead, and you have to recruit a novice to replace them. Yet while your emotional investment can never be fully recovered, the stat investment can be at least partially reclaimed. This is because experience points earned from completing missions is awarded to each individual soldier who participated and to a common pool. You're free to dip into this pool whenever you wish--maybe you just need a few more points to unlock that next tier perk you've had your eye on--but my strategy was to save the pool for new recruits. Every time I hired a new soldier I was able to level them up several times before they had pulled a trigger. It's a clever, flexible system that means veteran troop losses are a setback, but never a debilitating or irredeemable one.The tactical combat doesn’t suffer from the clumsy interface design that plagues the strategic layer. There are convenient overlays informing you of movement ranges, AP consumption, and targeting possibilities, it’s easy to scroll between different terrain heights, and everything requires deliberate selection so you don’t end up performing an action you didn’t intend. However I did very, very occasionally run into a problem where the overlay would tell me I had line of sight from a certain tile if I moved there, only to move there and discover I couldn’t actually see the enemy. And after dozens of hours of play, I still have no idea why my soldiers would sometimes start a new mission with their weapons needing reloading, nor indeed how to reload them when not in a mission. But these feel like trivial concerns in the grander scheme of what is an overall robust combat engine.Phoenix Point has plenty of bold new ideas for the XCOM genre, but not all of them have the same level of shine. It can feel a bit unwieldy at times, a bit less user-friendly than you'd hope. But it's a game that feels more concerned with experimentation than perfection, that's more interested in discovering new paths to take than walking one that's already well-trodden. As a hybrid tactical/strategy game, it's dynamic and deep with the occasionally disorientating misfire along the way. As a contribution to the genre XCOM first defined, it's a well-aimed shot."
1986,NES Remix 2,7.0,2,"NES Remix was a good idea when it launched without fanfare in late 2013 and reintroduced you to some of the greatest gaming moments from the 8-bit era, but NES Remix 2 is even better because it boasts a superior roster. Borrowing from a fresh assortment of classic games, this second retro bundle is a treat even though it doubles as a virtual salesperson. In NES Remix 2, you find a total of more than 150 bite-sized challenges carved from 10 different NES games. Typically, you are offered a series of three or four objectives, and you can make three attempts. Sometimes, there are extra steps, in which case you're provided additional lives. Elsewhere, you face only a single objective, but it's more difficult and time-consuming. At the end of a given challenge, your performance is awarded anywhere from one to three stars (with a special rainbow flourish also appearing for the truly adept), depending on how long you took and how often you failed. You also receive in-game currency called bits that unlock stamps you can use on your Miiverse posts. The game saves a video record of your run, for easy embedding and sharing, which adds a competitive side that these games once mostly lacked. Super Mario Bros. 3 stage, and you must choose when to jump and with how much vigor. Elsewhere, Link navigates a perilous series of ledges patrolled by mobile octopus enemies, all with a life meter that is nearly exhausted. These stages may be familiar to you, but they pose a new challenge if you're not used to hurrying through them. The most interesting diversions, however, are those that combine elements from multiple series, because you're especially likely to be caught by surprise by a setup you've never encountered before. Link might need to hack his way through bricks to collect coins in the Mushroom Kingdom, or Pit from Kid Icarus might have to try to collect fairies while avoiding flying ghosts in an environment that was ripped from Link's Adventure. Dr. Mario, Super Mario Bros. 2, Kirby's Adventure, and more. Had NES Remix 2 included complete editions of the selections it sort of compiles, the result would have been difficult to ignore. However, the only game you can completely explore here is a reworked version of Super Mario Bros. known as Super Luigi Bros. That addition lets two players take turns running through the classic platformer game, but with the experience modified so that the screen now scrolls from right to left, and the protagonist is Luigi. The less famous sibling slides and skids like a kid in socks on linoleum, but he jumps higher and further as compensation. When combined with the unconventional orientation, the altered physics make a stranger out of familiar terrain. Muscle memory and time-worn technique are no longer your allies. They're more likely to land you in a pit or send you flying headfirst into a patrolling goomba or koopa's personal space. Although there's more than enough content to keep you busy with NES Remix 2 for a good while, the package sometimes feels like the world's greatest glorified demo and not a distinct new experience. There's even a handy link to the eShop, which conveniently sells full versions of each excerpted game. A fair number of the objectives provide an overview of those selections and their most iconic hooks and gameplay mechanics, which is enough to whet your appetite. Other inclusions, however, are inexplicable. One challenge involves watching the Wario's Woods opening tutorial, for instance, and another screens a training montage from Punch-Out. The ending sequences for the various games are also shown, so it's a good idea to finish them ahead of time if you were saving such things for a surprise. NES Remix 2 is a highlights reel that you pay for, but that's not as bad as it sounds provided you are interested in challenging yourself while you reminisce and sample. Old conventions have been modified to offer enough variety and genuinely interesting challenges that they manage to prove fresh all over again. Nothing here works as a replacement for the original material, but this is still a delightful experience whether you remember blowing the dust out of 8-bit cartridges or not."
2778,AMY,3.0,0,"  Amy's eponymous infant is psychic, mute, and immune to the mysterious plague that has turned the people of Silver City into zombies. She is also a tiny fool who dashes from a safe hiding spot through a patch of zombies if you leave her alone for a few moments. If you think a frightened little girl deserves your unending patience, you haven't played this game. Amy (little girl) isn't nearly the biggest problem with Amy (downloadable survival horror adventure), however. The game stacks frustration on frustration such that you resent its rudimentary puzzles, shoddy stealth sections, and awkward combat far more than the kid you've led through it all. It's not without decent ideas, but any goodwill they earn the game burns through early and fully; tension and horror quickly give way to exasperation, punctuated by the occasional fake-out jump scare.         When you leave Amy's side, the omnipresent infection gradually zombifies Lana. As the contamination sensor on her back goes from green to yellow to red, her skin turns pale and veiny, and her vision becomes red and hazy. When Lana is contaminated enough, zombies mistake her for one of their own, as long as she moves slowly and leaves Amy behind, maybe stuffed in a cupboard somewhere. Despite all the supposed visual cues, it's unclear when Lana is infected enough to pass as a zombie (somewhere between veiny and very veiny). For maximum annoyance, couple that with a city street stealth section with an instant game-over on being detected by an enemy.         The imprecise controls extend to the kid's magic brain powers. You can't control Amy directly--though you can command her to stay still and occasionally send her to a designated spot--but you can clumsily aim and steer her two psychic spells. The most creative sequence based on these powers has Amy positioned high on a walkway, psychic-blasting enemies onto motion-sensitive electric mines, clearing the way for Lana, who is unarmed, as usual. But this, like all of Amy's sound ideas, is undermined in the wobbly execution. Amy can't climb ladders but can crawl through small gaps and press elevator buttons, giving rise to the preponderance of basic elevator puzzles (stand on elevator, make Amy push remote button). Old-school coloured key cards for locked doors are another puzzle staple. The most novel puzzle-like element comes via DNA-based locks; Lana has a hacking device that leads her to possible DNA samples (read: corpses) that might unlock the way forward.        "
1847,Gauntlet (2014),6.0,1,"Diablo, and clearly, it's done all right for itself over the years. That said, while Diablo is accessible, it's not the kind of game you'd have found swallowing up quarters for quick 10-minute sessions back when arcades were still profitable. As such, there's room in the current landscape for something far less ostentatious. The Gauntlet reboot wants so very badly to be that game, and on some level, it is. The formula has changed little since the 1985 original. You have four classes: warrior, valkyrie, wizard, and elf, and after a short introduction to the controls and the personalities--there's some mild but enjoyable Terry-Pratchettesque banter between the heroes throughout--you walk through a door, down a hallway, and then jackhammer the attack button into oblivion for the next six hours, laying waste to skeletons, cave monsters, trolls, and sorcerers. When you're done clearing enough rooms of them, and you've collected enough keys, eaten enough meat, and stolen enough gold, you find the exit. You rejoice. You repeat.   The first stages of nu-Gauntlet almost give the impression that the game requires just as little thought as its arcade forebears did. The good news--and the bad--is that this is not the case. Like the best of the best in this genre, Gauntlet does surprisingly solid work making each of the four characters play wholly differently from each other. The warrior is a straight top-down brawler; the valkyrie is a defensive, reactionary, strategic class; playing the elf is like playing a twin-stick shooter; and the wizard is an escapee from a real-time role-playing game, whose attacks involve two-button combinations that change spells from simple fireballs and beams of ice to full on cyclones summoned up to level the playing field. Put all four characters in the same level for some cooperative adventuring, and you've got a field of absolute chaos the likes of which you rarely see. Yes, you can still shoot the food. And yes, the game and your teammates are even snarkier and angrier when it happens. Zelda-ish spin attack, for instance, and the valkyrie throws her shield, Captain America-style--but the expected catharsis of taking out entire fields of your enemies in one fell swoop is nowhere to be found. Most of the time, you're stuck with standard attacks, and none are as precise or as free-flowing as you'd hope. Yes, you do have the ability to level up your characters. You can either buy new gear from the shopkeeper in the hub, or by use of a mastery system which rewards you for everything from killing a certain number of enemies with specials to getting yourself exploded. Pursuing mastery rewards gives Gauntlet a jolt of fun, but the rewards are slow coming, and should you perish during a stage, the game takes away the gold you've collected. And thus the stuff you could really use to get past that hard stage is out of reach until you clear the stage without it. Such cruel, cruel irony. The end result is a game that seems stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground, harboring more intricacy and challenge than the Gauntlet pedigree implies, but too bare-bones of a package to stand tall next to the action role-playing games currently competing for your time. The new Gauntlet has charms, and teaming up to take down the endless hordes is one of its most gratifying ones, but in a game like this, you shouldn't have to fight so hard for your right to party.  "
1149,Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap,8.0,2,"The Dragon's Trap is an early example of what's now commonly called a ""Metroidvania."" This style of action game presents a free-roaming map that you're able to explore more of as you obtain new items and abilities. Most of your abilities in The Dragon's Trap come from the animal forms you can take after beating the dragon bosses. You start off as a lizardman who has limited defense and movement capabilities but wields a ranged fire projectile. As you assume other forms, your abilities will expand greatly: a mouseman with small stature and the ability to scale certain walls, a piranhaman who can swim through water freely, a lionman with a fierce offensive sword swing, and a flight-capable hawkman who can soar the skies but rapidly loses health in water. Each of these forms offers a play style that's both unique and easy to grasp--you won't have to struggle to re-learn controls for each transformation.The world of The Dragon's Trap is fairly small compared to most modern games of this nature--there's no in-game map, but you probably won't need one. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially since this game doesn't have true ""save points."" If you die or continue a saved game, you'll always begin in the hub town. It's a nod to the game's old-school, password-save roots (you can even use old passwords, if you like), and while it can be a bit annoying to redo entire dungeons if you're KO'd partway through, it also emphasizes the importance of skillful play and proper preparation.What does ""proper preparation"" entail? Upgrading your weapons and armor, stocking up on limited-use magic spells that aid you in beating some of the game's more obnoxious enemies, and keeping a few health-restoring potions on hand that'll save your scaly/furry/feathered behind.A bit of exploration and creative thinking will pay off immensely in the form of loot-filled treasure rooms, permanent health boosts, and secret shops selling high-powered gear. Few things are more satisfying in The Dragon's Trap than pressing up in a suspicious-looking enclave to find a wondrous hidden door to a treasure chamber with copious goodies for the taking. Developer Dot Emu has even gone the extra mile and included new, extra-challenging secret areas made exclusively for this version of the game.Despite the world map's small size, each area manages to remain distinct and interesting--and this is augmented by the remake's charmingly upgraded presentation.Despite the world map's small size, each area manages to remain distinct and interesting--and this is augmented by the remake's charmingly upgraded presentation. Between the stunningly drawn backgrounds, exceptionally well-animated characters, and little visual flourishes that make every set of screens unique, The Dragon's Trap is a visual delight. What's even more amazing is that the core gameplay hasn't been compromised at all from the original to accommodate the new visuals--it's still the same in terms of controls, physics, and overall exploration progression. In fact, you can switch from new- to old-school visuals and sound on the fly with simple button presses.Despite its modernized 2D graphics, The Dragon's Trap does show its age in a few places. Sometimes the means of progression isn't always obvious, leaving you feeling stuck. This version of the game adds a fortune-teller who sometimes drops vague hints, which helps somewhat, but it's still a bit annoying to wander around aimlessly trying to find something to help you progress. (At least the old FAQs for the game are still useful.)A few of the mechanics also take some getting used to, such as the odd stun state that can happen when you're trapped by an enemy or rapid-fire projectiles and debilitated for seconds at a time. The boss fights also feel very underwhelming--the enemy dragons fall into simple patterns that are easy to learn after a bit of observation, and they don't change them up even at low health. But since they can tank a lot of damage, these encounters turn into tests of patience and endurance rather than skill.As things stand, however, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap shines as one of the best retro remakes yet. It knows not to tamper too much with the enjoyable, exploration-driven gameplay that made the original so good, instead focusing on updating the presentation to reintroduce the game to a new generation of players. While it's a bit on the short side--you can probably beat it over the course of a lazy Saturday--its small world is packed with personality. Whether you've played the original or are completely new to the weird, wacky world of Wonder Boy, The Dragon's Trap is an adventure well worth embarking on."
4096,The Godfather II,4.0,0,"  If The Godfather II had been a mediocre, mindless action flick, the game of the same name could at least be considered faithful to its source material. As it is, though, Coppola's Mafia-themed masterpiece has been reduced to an uninspired, repetitive open-world action game with out-of-context movie quotes and a handful of recognizable characters sprinkled throughout its forgettable story. To make matters worse, The Godfather II has clearly been released in an unfinished state and is riddled with performance issues and bugs like they've been fired from a Tommy gun.        You play as Dominic, an important member of the Corleone family who somehow managed to make it through the epic movie trilogy without ever wandering into camera shot despite apparently being involved in a number of key scenes. As one of Michael Corleone's most trusted men, you've been groomed to head up your own family, and after a brief introductory sequence set in Cuba, the game proper gets under way in a diminutive New York where you're instructed to set about making a name for yourself. From this point on, much of your time is spent seizing and attempting to retain control of businesses run by rival families in order to make money and, ultimately, force said families to retreat into their compounds where you can eliminate them entirely. Unfortunately, killing rival mafiosi and intimidating business owners gets repetitive quickly and isn't much fun to begin with.     That's largely because the gunplay in The Godfather II is neither challenging nor satisfying. You have an impressive arsenal at your disposal, and weapons like the Magnum and the shotgun really feel like they pack a punch, but the enemies you're using them against rarely seem too interested in self-preservation. Too many of them simply stand their ground or charge at you and, if they somehow manage to get close before you put a couple of bullets in their heads, can easily be grabbed, punched, strangled, or head-butted into the afterlife. With that said, the made men working for rival families are geniuses compared to the clowns you get to recruit into your own family. They have their uses, but even having them do something as simple as walk through a doorway ahead of you or climb into one of the game's many slow but slippery cars with you can take some work. Predictably, things don't get any better when they're put into combat situations or are asked to perform the very specific tasks that they supposedly each specialize in, which include cracking safes, committing arson, and kicking down doors.        The problem isn't that they're unable to perform those tasks; it's that walking from A to B is rarely straightforward for them. When they're not failing to get into cars with you or running rings around one another at superhuman speeds, your guys can often be observed wandering off in the wrong direction or just remaining stationary while appearing to ponder their next step. Doorways are especially problematic, regardless of whether you're leading the way or are trying to send your guys in ahead of you to soak up some enemy fire. When you're in front, it's not uncommon to open a door, step into a room, and encounter the guys that were right behind you already standing around waiting for you in there. Other times they prefer to enter through different doors while running backward, or perhaps crash through a window for an entrance that really gets them noticed. If you turn your back on them, though, they'll be warped instantly to your side, sometimes.      Initially you get to recruit only one of these laughable soldiers for your family, and you get to choose between a demolitions expert and a medic. The former can create shortcuts through walls and blow up buildings, but like most of the crew abilities, these can be used in only very specific locations. The latter is arguably the most useful guy you'll ever meet, because if you or any other crew member gets killed, he can bring you back to life with full health just by sticking a needle in you. Ultimately, you can recruit up to seven made men for your family, and as they prove their worth, you can spend money on attribute upgrades and better weapons for them and even promote them so that they can specialize in more than one field. It behooves you to take the maximum allowed three crew members with you on every mission that you accept and to every business that you make a move on, because location layouts are generally so contrived and architecturally improbable that, for example, the only way into a building with seemingly easily accessible doors might be to blow a hole in a wall or to have your engineer cut a hole in a fence. Annoyingly, there's no consistent rule set in the world of The Godfather II, so while some fences can be cut through in specific locations, other, identical-looking fences, are impenetrable. Doors are another example; some can be kicked down, some can be lock-picked, and others can't be opened even with dynamite. You can't even predict which waist-high walls you'll be able to vault over until you get close enough to try, which is incredibly frustrating if you're fleeing from the cops on foot.        Businesses that you control after successfully negotiating all of the aforementioned problems don't just earn you money; they can also unlock special perks for you if you claim every business within a crime ring. Controlling both of New York's prostitution rackets will get you brass knuckles, while three diamond smuggling operations in Florida will earn you and your crew bulletproof vests, for example. These crime-ring bonuses add some small degree of strategy to the proceedings when it comes to planning your next move, not least because rival families can benefit from the same bonuses that you can, but none of the bonuses significantly impact the difficulty of subsequent actions--regardless of who has them. Rivals will often attempt to reclaim or bomb businesses that you control, denying you your bonuses if they succeed, so it's important to hire guards to protect them. The guards aren't always up to the job if a rival family decides to send soldiers and capos along, but at the very least they'll buy you some time until you can send members of your own crew there via the ""Don's View"" map screen or go and join the fight yourself.         Rival families can be eliminated only when they've lost control of all businesses and have retreated to their fortress-like compounds. At this point, the compounds become unlocked so that you can get into them and fight your way to wherever it is that you need to place a bomb. In theory, you shouldn't attempt this kind of operation until you've weakened a family by assassinating a number of its made men, but in practice, the only real difference between those guys and the regular guards is that it takes more bullets to put them down. Interestingly, the only way to permanently kill a made man other than to bomb his family's compound is to do so in a way that sends a specific message to his family, and you can find out which message needs to be sent only by doing favors for people you meet on the street. Remember how Vito Corleone was unable to turn down any request from a friend on his daughter's wedding day in the first Godfather movie? Well, this is nothing like that. Rather, you approach complete strangers and tell them they look like they need help, at which point they tell you who or which building they want attacked. Do them the favor, and they'll tell you where one of your enemies can be found and that he can only be killed with a Molotov, with a shot between the eyes, with a fall from a great height, by being run over with a car, or something similar. Not only is soliciting murder advice from random pedestrians totally absurd, carrying out these contrived actions is more trouble than it's worth, so you'll probably end up just bombing the compound every time.         Once you take down all five families, you're about done with the single-player portion of The Godfather II. Multiplayer modes designed for up to 16 players include Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault, FireStarter, and Safecracker. You play as one of the members of your crew from the single-player game, and as you earn honor points online, you can use them to upgrade your guys' weapon licenses so that they're able to use more-powerful guns both online and off. Your choice of crew member will likely be dictated by the game type that you're playing because, in case you hadn't guessed, those last three modes favor players with demolition, arson, and safecracker skills, respectively. Unfortunately, The Godfather II's multiplayer isn't much fun. Targeting enemies without the lock-on feature feels too imprecise on consoles, completing objectives on the non-deathmatch modes doesn't earn you as many points as just killing people, and most of the maps are too big for just 16 players.     One of the more interesting multiplayer features, regardless of the fact that it's functional rather than fun, is the option for one player on each team to play as the don. As the don, you don't play as a guy on the ground at all, but as a disembodied camera flying high above the map and able to relay information to teammates about enemy locations and the like both with voice chat and by dropping waypoint beacons. When your team captures strategic locations on the map, you can also reward them with bulletproof vests and other perks, which is great for them but as boring as it sounds for you. Worse still, you can only fly around freely at a fixed altitude, so although you have the option to jump between players and key locations with a couple of button presses, your movement still feels oddly restricted. It's possible to make money as the don by betting on the outcome of games, but money's unlikely to be an issue once you near the end of the single-player game, so it's hardly compelling.        Questionable design choices aside, the problem with almost every aspect of The Godfather II is simply that it feels unfinished. Dated visuals, voiced lines of dialogue that seemingly play at random and often inappropriate times, dead bodies falling through scenery, a car hovering in the air about half a mile off the Cuban coast, being able to snipe enemies through walls and doors that haven't popped into view yet, guards who fail to recognize you as a threat when you walk into a federal building and crack a safe, cars and pedestrians that appear and disappear long before they leave your range of vision, getting stuck in an animation somewhere between a regular walk and a crouch after vaulting through a window--these are just some of the problems we encountered in the 13 hours or so that it took to play from start to finish. Even looking past these anomalies, all you're going to find is repetitive, unsatisfying gameplay in an illogical, inconsistent world. The Godfather II should have been an offer impossible to refuse, but like Michael's brother Fredo, this one will break your heart.   "
3795,Terminator Salvation (2009),5.0,1,"  If you've ever wondered why movie tie-in games have such a bad reputation, Terminator Salvation can provide an instructive example. Though this third-person shooter is technically sound, it seems to rely entirely on the presumption that you'll be so jazzed to be playing as characters from the movie that you won't notice how boring and shallow the action is. Most of the game has you jogging from skirmish to skirmish, fighting the same three enemies and using the same cover-and-flank maneuver. This quickly becomes repetitive despite the fact that the environments are diverse and detailed, and the few on-rails sequences fail to inject any substantial excitement into the proceedings. The campaign is only about five hours long, there is no online component, and the only multiplayer option is playing the campaign in split-screen mode. It's a sparse effort, yet it is brazenly offered at full retail price. Suffice it to say, it isn't worth it, and even Terminator fans looking for a weekend rental should prepare for disappointment.      The game is set two years before the events of the movie, and though it features some of the actors from the film, Christian Bale is notably absent. The story chronicles a particularly foolhardy mission, and it does a reasonably good job of depicting John Connor on his journey from foot soldier to leader of humankind. There are a lot of cutscenes (sometimes too many) that help lend the game a cinematic feel, but the not-so-great character models and general blurriness keep them from feeling dramatic. The thoughtful and detailed environments do a better job of setting the postapocalyptic stage. It's interesting to make your way through the various conflict-ravaged locations, but your progress is frequently interrupted by fairly long loading screens that give you a close-up view of the iconic Terminator face. You can move this impressively modeled head around (and make it nod in response to silly questions), but its piercing red glare soon becomes an unavoidable reminder that you are sitting through yet another loading screen.     Unfortunately, the action isn't as diverse as the environments. You spend the majority of your time in Terminator Salvation on foot, moving from location to location and dispatching mechanical menaces along the way. You move at a light jog unless you are sliding between cover positions using the clever radial movement menu. A semicircle pops up when you are in cover and incline the analog stick toward another cover position, allowing you to select a new spot to move to. This mechanic makes maneuvering around the battlefield slick and easy, though it is plagued by inconsistency that can leave you exposed to enemy fire or trapped in a corner. Your AI teammate(s) can get you out of a jam by distracting the enemy or firing at its weak point, but they too are prone to inconsistency and aren't fond of using more-powerful weapons or explosives.     So it's up to you to grab the rocket and grenade launchers when you come across them and use them to take down tough enemies, such as the flying Hunter-Killers. With the exception of these HKs and a few other special guests, you fight only three types of enemies throughout the entire game. Each of these is weak to a specific munition, of which there are three loose categories: bullets, shells, and explosives. The three enemies match up to the three munition types, and this simple correlation makes combat very formulaic: destroy the flying drones with shells, shoot the crablike robots with bullets in their weak backsides, and blast the humanoid T-600s with explosives. You can obliterate weaker enemies with explosives, of course, but then you'll have to expend a huge number of bullets on the tougher ones to bring them down. This combat design essentially forces you to use the same simple tactics throughout the entire game. You get into cover, blast the enemy with the appropriate weapon, and flank when necessary. The only real threat is getting caught out in the open and riddled with bullets, or getting meleed by a T-600 (which can kill you with a swing of its arm even if it's five feet away and there is a barrier between you). With some light maneuvering, these threats are easily avoided, and enemies are more than happy to vigorously shoot at your cover position, waiting for you to destroy them.         This repetitious combat is broken up by a bunch of on-rails sequences that put you on the back of a vehicle manning a weapon with unlimited ammunition. These sections are a good change of pace, but they are too lackluster and awkward to be fun. You never get to drive the vehicle, which could have been a thrill on the perilous ruined freeways of postapocalyptic Los Angeles, and it seems that the coolest stuff that happens is conveyed by a cutscene that disconnects you from the action. Shooting your enemies in these sequences is a bit tricky, and not just because you are both moving at high speeds. Your targeting reticle will often drift inappropriately, as if you were standing on a Roomba in the back of your vehicle instead of hunkered down in a fixed position. The struggle to compensate for your vehicle's motion, your enemy's motion, and your mysterious drift makes these sections more challenging and less fun.     Terminator Salvation is a completely linear adventure without any collectibles or hidden goodies to search for. Every weapon is highlighted with a green outline that is visible through walls, so you won't spend any time dillydallying. You can complete the story in under five hours, at which point your only options for replay are to play it in split-screen with a friend or to try it on a harder difficulty setting. There's not a lot of content here, and even the achievements and trophies are the bare minimum; you could earn them all just by playing the game through once on hard. This no-frills attitude runs throughout the whole game and reveals Terminator Salvation for what it is: a stripped cash-in attempt packed with dull, uninspired, and repetitive action.  "
4719,Underground Pool,3.0,0,"  It's unlikely that anyone would go into a budget- priced handheld pool game and expect the moon from it, but it wouldn't be hard to expect more than what a ramshackle piece of junk like Underground Pool offers up. Shoddy ball physics, useless artificial intelligence, clumsy touch-screen controls, ugly graphics, shrill audio, and a severe lack of modes are just the highlights of what's wrong with this game.         Underground Pool offers single game, challenge mode, and multiplayer options. The challenge mode is the closest the game gets to a career mode, but it's really just a scattered collection of tournaments that unlock, of all things, more tournaments. Winning tournaments nets you cash, but the cash doesn't do anything for you, except let you buy into more tournaments down the road. There are no bonus items or new pool gear to purchase--not even new games to unlock. In fact, Underground Pool offers only two variations of the game of pool: 8-ball and 9-ball. There isn't even an option to futz with the rules of each game.      Considering how utterly inept the two included pool variations are, maybe it's for the best that the developers didn't try to shoot for higher sky and add more. For one thing, you might as well just ignore most of the game's touch-screen functions. The game lets you rotate the pool cue around the table with the stylus, but it's generally easier and less flustering to do it with the D pad. Tapping on the cue when it's positioned at the top or bottom of the screen often results in no response whatsoever. The one thing the touch screen is useful for is setting power for your shot, but even this mechanic is flawed because the game doesn't use an intuitive power meter. It's just a stick that you move up and down to determine how far back the pool cue is from the cue ball. While that might seem easy enough, there are times in this game when seemingly small amounts of power send balls flying every which way, so any measure of predictability is absent here. It probably has at least something to do with the game's oddball physics. There's a bit of weightiness to the balls on the table, but they seem too light overall, bouncing much more wildly than real pool balls do.     Another huge flaw is that the camera system makes lining up proper shots nearly impossible. You can float between a few different camera angles, but only one of them lets you properly line up with a ball on the table, and even then, it's tough to gauge whether the angles you're taking are beneficial or not. Again, part of the issue is the weird physics model, but it's tough to make much headway with these awful camera angles, especially when the on-the-table angle can't deal with your cue ball being near the edge of the table and obscures your view of practically everything.     That the AI opponents are basically idiots does ease some of the challenge presented by the lame camera and broken controls. These invisible dolts repeatedly screw up seemingly easy shots. Even when all they have to do is hit the side of a slightly blocked ball to avoid a foul, they still can't pull it together. The Black Widow these players are not.        On top of everything else, Underground Pool looks and sounds awful, which is sad considering that the graphics are probably the least offensive part of the game. The game does include several different tables and club backgrounds, but none of them are pleasant to look at. The tables look kind of grainy and blurry, and you can barely see the club backgrounds, save for quick looks now and again. The audio is probably the game's worst feature. The ball-clacking noises sound weirdly tinny and compressed, and the soundtrack consists of some of the most gratingly terrible MIDI you can imagine. It's not even music. It's a 5-year-old with hooks for hands slamming wildly on random keys on a MIDI keyboard. Horrific stuff.     Whether or not you're a pool enthusiast, Underground Pool is not the game for you. The single-player game is pointless and severely not fun to play, the multiplayer game isn't any better (and requires multiple carts--there's no download play), and the whole game is presented poorly. Go plop down $20 at a local pool hall, and leave this hunk of junk on the shelf.  "
876,WarioWare Gold,8.0,2,"The 300 microgames are split between Mash games (which use the D-Pad and A button, like in the Game Boy Advance original), Twist games (which are controlled by tilting the console, à la WarioWare: Twisted!), and Touch games (that use the touchscreen, like DS launch title WarioWare: Touched!). There are also a handful of games that make you blow into the microphone, making the playlists that incorporate them slightly more embarrassing to play on public transport. Just under 40 of these microgames are new, with the rest being pulled from previous games in the series.When you start one of WarioWare Gold's microgame playlists, you'll be hit with a cavalcade of tasks in quick succession. In the space of a minute you might find yourself hammering the A button to snort up a dangling snot bubble, using the D-Pad to guide Wario as he jumps on Goombas, or navigating a short maze to find a treasure chest. You could be tilting the system to ward off samurai attacks or to extract a dead tooth from an open mouth; if your stylus is out you might be guiding a needle through a thread on the touch screen or slicing flying food, Fruit Ninja-style. You'll be given a very brief instruction at the start of each game (""Avoid!,"" ""Stack!,"" ""Remember!""), and a few seconds to decipher and complete the task.In Story Mode, each supporting character is given a playlist with a control type and game theme. Most of the games are divided between Sport, Fantasy, Nintendo, and That's Life (essentially miscellaneous) categories, although these are mostly aesthetic distinctions, as a lot of them play similarly. When you select a playlist for the first time you only need to beat a handful of microgames and the character's Boss game--a slightly longer, more involved event that is closer to minigame than microgame--to clear it. The next time you play, you're going for a high score, with the games increasing in difficulty and speed as you go. The Nintendo-themed retro games are a highlight, as always, although the boss levels for the Mash and Touch playlists are disappointing (thankfully the tilt-controlled version of Super Mario Bros. you'll get to play in the Twist section is fantastic).You can comfortably complete every character's playlist and ""finish"" the game within two hours, and unlock all the microgames in five, but WarioWare is all about the long tail. Over time you'll want to build up familiarity with each microgame to get a high score--the best way to succeed is to immediately know what to do when the instruction pops up. There's a lot of repetition involved, but thankfully it's extremely fun. The three WarioWare games that Gold most directly pulls from--the original GBA game, plus Twisted and Touched--were all fantastic in their own ways and having all three play styles in a single game is a delight.The challenge playlists that unlock after you beat the story, which allow you to play microgames under numerous different conditions, offer even more immediate thrills than the story playlists, which can take a while to heat up. Playing with only a single life, or testing your mettle in a mode where games switch between the upper and lower screen with very little time in between, can be tense and exciting. Sneaky Gamer mode, the one excellent mode from Game &amp; Wario, returns here too. In this mode, you play as series staple 9-Volt, who plays microgames on the bottom screen but must occasionally hide under his blanket on the top screen if his mother comes into the room to check if he's asleep. Keeping track of your game progress while also looking out for the telltale signs that your mum is about to burst into the room is a surprisingly nerve-wracking experience. There's great variety in these lists, and you can choose which control styles you want to focus on--in the extremely fast Very Hard challenge mode, for instance, you're given separate leaderboards for Mash, Twist, Touch, and Ultra (which mixes every control style) modes.WarioWare is also where Nintendo lets its freak flag fly, and Gold gets beautifully weird. The artists interpret Wario in different ways throughout the game--one microgame might render him in janky polygons, while another might draw him as a downtrodden everyman working in a factory. He might be fat, thin, or absurdly ripped--it feels like each microgame was designed with a huge degree of artistic and creative control. The cutscenes before each chapter in Story mode are legitimately funny--WarioWare has a firmly established cast of characters, all of whom have separate personalities and backstories, and they're a delight to watch. Wario is given far more spoken dialog than is typical of Nintendo's characters, too. You'd be hard-pressed to find another game with so many lines delivered by Charles Martinet, who imbues Wario with a sense of pride and malice here that's a delight to witness. You can also unlock the ability to redub each character's intro and outro cutscenes with your own voice, which is perfect for anyone who thinks Wario doesn't swear enough.Outside of finding all the microgames, there's a long list of extras to unlock within WarioWare Gold. They're available through what is essentially a loot box system, although, thankfully, it only uses currency earned in-game. You can spend coins to crank the handle on a capsule machine, which will drop one of several prizes ranging from oddities (character-themed alarm clocks and collector cards) to educational props (a gallery of past Nintendo consoles and inventions), through to more enjoyable and substantial offerings, including soundtrack albums and larger, more fleshed-out minigames. Those minigames vary in quality and complexity, but a few of them are truly great, and they're really what you want every time you crank the wheel. While there's a lot of filler in the capsules it's also not too difficult to earn coins, which are handed out through regular play and whenever you achieve any of the goals set out in the game's Mission screen (which include several demanding high-score goals that should keep you engaged for a while). This means unlocks are tied to persistence rather than skill, and that anyone who sticks with the game for long enough can reasonably unlock everything.WarioWare Gold might not be entirely new, but it's the best representation available of what makes this series special. It's a true greatest hits package that showcases Wario's unique weirdo vibe, and this style of play remains inventive and thrilling 15 years after the original Game Boy Advance game. We're still hoping for an entirely new title on Switch in the future, but for now Gold is a compelling, generous victory lap."
67,Redfall,4.0,0,"Arkane doesn't put ladders in its games. The team says as much with a succinctly stated poster in one of the rooms in its Austin location: ""F**k ladders,"" it reads. The team has said ladders feel limiting by putting players in a ""mode"" where they can't use their weapons or abilities, and they often even fall to their deaths anyway--Arkane hates ladders. And yet, there are ladders early and often in Redfall. This surprise would become emblematic of my time in the vampire-infested Massachusetts town. Redfall is Arkane making compromises to its own design philosophies to serve a genre it may have been better off avoiding.Redfall is a four-player co-op loot-shooter that pits players against vampires and the cultists who follow them. The story premise is classic Arkane stuff, but in practice, it plays like a tug-of-war that its usually inventive team could not win. Most aspects of what the team is known for--unrivaled world design, intricate immersive sim elements, improvisational combat--are rarely found here. In their place are run-and-gun fights with unresponsive AI enemies amid a host of bugs that are so prevalent, it genuinely feels dejecting to see the game launch in this state. Wherever things have gone wrong in Redfall, and there are several places, it feels like the result of a team with a foot in disjointed worlds: what it's known for and what it's tasked with doing.The game's two maps are bigger than anything Arkane has done before, from either its team in Texas or France, but the team struggles to fill that space with the same intricacies that made games like Dishonored and Deathloop both Game of the Year winners and Prey a cult classic. Too often, you and up to three others playing in co-op will move across barren beaches or through wooded areas with little more than some sheds or campsites to rummage through. The game's second map, which you'll unlock halfway through the campaign, is noticeably better because it comes closer to the team's past efforts, with more interesting landmarks and more verticality built into its neighborhoods, but it still doesn't quite get there.Traveling from A to B in creative ways has always been Arkane's signature. And in Redfall, there are opportunities to get crafty when entering some buildings, like by going through the roof, by picking a lock on a door, or by climbing through a window. But moments like these are too spread apart, and in the middle you'll often find blander elements such as small gangs of enemies waiting to be dispatched with no more consideration than choosing which gun to use. In Redfall, you can only really speak one language: killing enemies. There's no reward for creatively completing missions and you're eventually funneled into an all-out firefight in every encounter, even when you take the time to play smarter, discouraging you from trying to solve any problem in a more creative way than just shooting everyone.The stealth mechanics are also underdeveloped. Sneaking up behind an enemy to deliver a knockout blow has no animation of its own. You just whack them the same way you shatter a window, and this method unpredictably leads to some enemies being defeated while others survive the blow and kick off normal combat.Underbosses serve as neighborhood terrorizers whom you must draw out after completing local missions, but in virtually every case, they can be one- or two-shotted on normal difficulty with the game's Stake Launcher, a weapon that is too powerful for the game's own good. Stakes should kill vampires quickly, of course, but because they do, the ubiquity of Stake Launchers nullifies many of the game's encounters. This is a balancing issue that is common in Redfall. Even the game's intended tougher parts, like vampire nests and overpowered enemies called Rooks--who spawn every so often when you've caused too much mayhem--can be overcome pretty breezily in most cases. And when that wasn't the case, often the opposite was true--suddenly overwhelming enemy forces would result in instant death. The game rarely strikes the right balance.Redfall is the latest in a long line of games to develop an obsession with loot, but the game struggles to nail even the basic, well-established concept of how that loot should be doled out. In most other loot-heavy games, tiered loot drops on a reliable upward trajectory--early loot grants you common or slightly uncommon weapons, and as you progress, you'll see the loot getting gradually better and rarer. In Redfall, the weapons tend to get stronger, but their rarities follow no pattern. The five color-coded rarities can each drop at any point in the campaign. I was finding purples and golds in the first hour, just as I was finding grays and greens in the final few missions.As such, the loot aspect of Redfall feels faulty and unnecessary. In one perplexing moment during one of the first side missions, a loot drop simultaneously granted me a gray sniper, a green sniper, a blue sniper, and a purple sniper. There are some cool guns to be found, like a UV Beam that turns vampires to stone so you can then blast them to pebbles, but the best guns are notable for their basic functions, not because of RNG-defined perks that have been hamfisted into yet another game. It's easy to see a version of Redfall that has smaller but deeper maps without the loot system. Perhaps that would be too much like the team's other games, which makes Redfall stand out for being different in Arkane’s catalog. But in all the ways it's different, it's worse.Its story, which is actually full of interesting lore, similarly struggles to leave its mark because of the genre's all-too-common use of stiff quest-givers dishing out instructions as they stand in the same place for the whole game. Arkane's worlds have always been rich with character and environmental storytelling, but Redfall needs to serve its loot-shooter master, so cardboard-like NPCs feign narrative intrigue, leaving the plot to feel like window dressing. What could've been a fun story that basically equates venture capitalists to bloodsuckers is instead nullified by forgettable delivery at nearly every turn.The silver lining is faint, but Redfall does have a few things going for it. For one, its foursome of vampire-slaying heroes are all fun to inhabit, not just because of their unique abilities, but their personalities too. The more you complete missions with a particular group of co-op partners, the more your characters will communicate as they build trust. This helps color in their identities which can be difficult in a game--and genre--that is so often focused on filling space and time with things to do to the point of drowning out its heroes.They also play off each other well due to their unique skills. It feels like the studio took its usual protagonist concept and divided it into quarters. This can sometimes mean solo players feel like they're incomplete, existing as only a fraction of Prey's Morgan Yu or Dishonored's Corvo or Emily, but when played in co-op, team synergy shines. Using one hero's ability to teleport over a gap where then another lifts up the team using her elevator-like maneuver to get onto a roof so that a third teammate can drop in through the skylight and cloak past enemies to unlock the front door and let them all in to cause chaos is the sort of player-driven moment that I thought this game would have a lot of. It doesn't have them often enough, but when they occur, the game is at its best.While the world doesn't feel like the player's canvas in ways you might expect, it is nonetheless a fun place to explore in one very particular way. It leans into its Massachusetts setting in a manner that suggests to me, a native of the state, that someone on the team really likes it there. Moving down cobblestone pathways lined with pumpkins to collect junk loot like legally distinct chainstore donuts and candles that smell of steamed lobster, all while NPCs with thick Boston accents berate each other over the airwaves like they're talking about the Sox, was an authentic touch of home, though I understand few players will get the same enjoyment out of that aspect.Ultimately, Redfall is a game that should not have been released yet. Its litany of bugs hampers the gameplay loop of exploring its world with friends, and that loop itself feels compromised by elements that are poorly executed and ill-suited to the team implementing them. I can't pretend to know whether Arkane chose to make a loot-shooter or was assigned to make a loot-shooter, but I can tell you what it feels like: one of the best game studios in the world suddenly made toothless."
3788,Classic Action: Devilish,5.0,1,"  Originally released for the Sega Game Gear and eventually ported to the Sega Genesis, Devilish was essentially Breakout with an evil twist. Instead of simply being tasked with using your ball and paddle to clear a static field of blocks, your challenge was to break blocks to progress through a series of levels filled with satanic enemies, power-ups, and screen-filling boss fights. Furthermore, you were given control of multiple paddles, which could be moved vertically or horizontally, and these paddles could be switched into different configurations on the fly. This would not have been a bad concept in the right hands, but clumsy execution prevented Devilish from being particularly noteworthy. Inexplicably, there is now a remake of Devilish on the Nintendo DS, which is even more awkward and pointless than its predecessor.        The basic gameplay of Classic Action: Devilish remains much the same on the DS as it was on the Game Gear in '91, but the 16 years between the two have afforded Devilish a story arc about a king and his daughter defending their kingdom against Satan's army. As entertaining as that might sound in synopsis, it plays out as a string of dull dialog sequences between levels. The functional updates made to Devilish are less pronounced. Though there's no touch-screen love, the action plays out across both screens of the DS, with gravity pulling the ball toward the bottom. Having a longer playfield improves the scope of the action, but once things start moving quickly, it can be difficult to switch your focus from one screen to the other. You can move both paddles horizontally using the D pad, though by pressing up and down on the D pad, you can affect the upper paddle's vertical orientation. Tapping the shoulder buttons rotates the upper paddle, which is an admitted improvement over the predetermined configurations you had to cycle through in the original Devilish.      All of this fiddling with the position and orientation of your paddles allows the game to throw some serpentine level designs at you. This means you'll have to bank the ball around sharp corners or U-turns as you smash through castle walls, piles of bones, and a somewhat limited variety of enemies. You'll also happen upon treasure chests with power-ups--as well as power-downs--that can change the size of your paddles, affect the speed of the ball, turn your ball into a brick-smashing rocket for a limited time, and more. There are boss fights at the end of each stage, but they're so pedestrian and unimaginative that it's hard to get excited. First level? Giant spider. Second level? Ghost lady. Third level? Two giant spiders.     The level layouts provide some challenge while a constantly ticking countdown clock adds a touch of urgency, but buggy ball physics and bad collision detection really just kill the whole experience. A big part of the problem lies in your ability to rotate your upper paddle to a variety of angles, which produces some erratic behavior. If you hit the ball at an odd angle, the ball might suddenly start moving several times faster, ricochet in the opposite direction than it should, or simply pass right through the paddle. This isn't the only frustration that Devilish offers either. As the game progresses, levels get longer and more involved, but despite their increasing challenge, any time the ball gets past your lower paddle, you have to start the whole level over again. It's agitating and a lousy way for the game to make up for the fact that you could otherwise blow through its five levels in an hour or two.     The fidelity of the in-game visuals has been improved since Devilish appeared on the Game Gear, though all of the personality has been siphoned out. Enemy sprites look generic, and backgrounds consist of lots of bland, repeating textures. Even on a technical level, the flat 2D presentation isn't up to the standards of the DS. The game also sounds generic because it constantly recycles the same few impact noises regardless of the types of surfaces the ball hits, with a vaguely spooky, medieval tunes rendered in lifeless MIDI awash in the background.     The original Devilish wasn't particularly great, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that its late-breaking follow-up doesn't really dazzle either. It does attempt some minor mechanical improvements over its predecessor, but the shoddy collision detection and bland presentation prevent Devilish from being anything more than a promising idea.  "
2160,Stick it to the Man!,7.0,2,"  Psychonauts. The arm proves invaluable and you can readily use its telepathic mode to read the thoughts of the people, animals, and robots around you to learn what they need and what puzzles you should be trying to solve. The surreal artistic style isn't the only aspect of Stick It to the Man that that's a bit twisted; the sense of logic has just as many oddball wrinkles. In the space of a few minutes, you might peel back the corner of a building to reveal the people inside, use the pink spaghetti arm to read a nearby poodle's thoughts to learn that it wants more-ferocious teeth, use the arm to steal a set of false teeth from a nearby person's mouth, and slap the false teeth into the dog's mouth all to the tune of the game's noire jazz tunes. The arm emerging from Ray's head is a remarkable and useful appendage. Need to reach a ledge? Just aim the spaghetti arm at a pin above the ledge, and trigger the arm to grab the pin, swinging Ray along in the process. This mechanic feels like a webswinging in a Spider-Man game, and using your worm body as a whip to grab a branch and swing across a gap recalls Earthworm Jim. A responsive, fun control system helps bring it to life here, and it's easy to execute half a dozen swings within a matter of seconds once you get used to it. Ray is chased by dozens of government agents who'll gladly gladly grab him and tase him to death, though he promptly respawns at a nearby Mr. Copy save point. Instead of dodging or outrunning the agents--which you can do if you want to--you can readily use the arm to gleefully read and mess with the agents' minds to find their weaknesses. If they're thinking about napping or about how to abduct you, for instance, you can grab a sleep icon or an image of your face from their thought bubbles, and then slap those icons onto your pursuers to put them to sleep or force them to chase a decoy of you, respectively. Should you find yourself cornered, it's easy to aim the arm at a nearby pin and quickly swing towards a ledge, traversing walls and surrounding scenery in the process. Even if you think you're trapped, an escape is usually possible, and the pink spaghetti arm makes continuous, nimble evasion both easy and fun. This is a world filled with the random thoughts of aliens, insane psychiatrists, presidential brains in jars, and government agents wondering about Descartes. It's easy to learn the Stick it to the Man's movement, environment and puzzle mechanics, which in turn allows you to apply your gray matter to solving the conundrum at hand. When the rhythm of a level clicks into place, there's unfettered joy in exploring the map and literally peeling away layers to discover new areas, reading the minds of the kooky characters around you, and using the nimble arm to solve three or four puzzles at once while swinging across the environment with abandon.    Your enjoyment of Stick It to the Man might be interrupted by occasional audio bugs, such as an issue where a character's screams echo no matter how far from the source you travel within the level. Misleading cues also lead to some frustrating situations. While I was generally able to figure things out, there are times when characters steer you in the wrong direction, especially during an escort session in the asylum level; I had to lead a girl outside of the asylum to a stuffed whale corpse, even though her audio cues indicated she wanted to be led to a dead mouse for her cat. Purchasing Stick It to the Man from the PlayStation Store functions as a cross-buy and entitles you to both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions. This is a dark, thoroughly ridiculous world you're visiting, but it's an inviting one, and its odd sense of humor, semi-absurd puzzles, and delightful action grab your attention and hold it."
2122,Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,2.0,0,"   Yes, there are a number of playable characters with different abilities. Marceline can float right over pits and traps, for instance, while the Ice King can freeze enemies. But no matter which character you choose, the exploration remains slow and tedious; the dungeons remain bereft of interesting places, enemies to fight, or items to discover; and the combat remains excruciatingly shallow and simplistic. No subweapon you might find and pick up in the dungeon, be it a kitten gun or a fire hose (that is, a hose that shoots fire) does anything to liven up the process of pushing buttons mindlessly until monsters fall before you. You can play with up to three friends, but then you're all just sharing a miserable experience. Rogue Legacy, in which there's a satisfying loop of earning more treasure in the dungeon, which lets you strengthen your character, which lets you earn yet more treasure on your subsequent dungeon runs. But in Adventure Time, spending time slogging through several levels of the dungeon, only to realize that you don't have enough treasure yet to purchase any upgrades and must try to slog through several more levels and collect still more treasure, just feels like punishment on top of punishment. Adventure Time won't find enough entertaining quips or goofy moments to reward them for struggling through the dungeon. The game's title may not provide justification for exploring the dungeon, but the much bigger I DON'T KNOW here is why anyone would play this game."
4143,The Mechsmith: Run=Dim,4.0,0,"Import - Played enough action games or strategy sims featuring mechs? Idea Factory recently released The Mechsmith for the PlayStation 2, bringing a slightly different perspective to your everyday mech game. The game takes place in the 21st century, a few years after global flooding has crippled the entire planet. Both military organizations and industrial corporations have developed mechs called RBs to revitalize the planet's global economy. With the financial support of the Green Frontier organization, you will operate a corporation that develops RBs.    You start out with a handful of engineers and one RB. You first develop several parts for RBs, such as body parts, engines, computers, and weapons. After setting up your RB, it is ready for a test battle. The test battle plays similar to Virtua On or Frame Gride, except that you don't control the mechs directly. You will be giving out commands - such as attack, guard, and avoid - to control the mech. The RB has two gauges during the battle, one for body points and another for energy tank points. The body points are basically the hit points of the RB, and the energy tank gauge indicates how long the RB can operate. Different commands consume different amounts of the energy tank, so you must choose wisely in giving commands. Winning the battle earns you more money, but every battle you engage in will cost you some money in the inevitable repairs. As you earn more money, your company grows and will be able hire more engineers and develop better RB parts. Your final objective is to create the strongest RB possible.    Developing new parts and customizing your RBs is fun, but having to observe the battle from a third-person point of view is where the fun starts to fade away. The AI of the mechs isn't too sharp, and unless you're outmatched from a parts standpoint, you're almost guaranteed a victory. The graphics and sound are sub par for a PS2 game, and with the exception of the smooth frame rate and the higher resolution, the game could have done just fine on the PS. After winning battles, you pretty much just repeat the cycle of developing new parts, re-outfitting your mech, and then returning to battle. The game's final objective of making the best RB is not terribly challenging, and you'll soon begin wonder what more the game has to offer. Perhaps the only replay value comes when you have another person playing against you. The game features a two-player versus mode, where you can use your saved data and your mechs to fight against each other.    The Mechsmith can be referred to as SimMech, but unlike the Sim series, it lacks what that makes these types of simulation games really interesting: fun. Take a pass on this one, even if you are looking for something different in a mech game."
2754,FIFA Soccer (2012),8.0,2,"  There's a reason FIFA Football (that's FIFA Soccer to those in the US) on the Vita lacks the ""12"" tag of its console counterparts. Many of the franchise's compelling new features, such as the Tactical Defending System, Precision Dribbling, and the Player Impact Engine are missing, as is the excellent EA Sports Football Club online mode. While that's disappointing, the classic FIFA gameplay is still a lot of fun, bringing all the thrills, spills, and drama of the world's biggest sport to the Vita. There's fluidity to the gameplay that produces some wonderful football, and that paired with the official licences, great visuals, and slew of modes makes for an experience few sports games can match.       Impressively, all of FIFA 12's single-player modes have made the jump to the Vita. At the heart of these is Virtual Pro, in which you create a player, selecting his age, play style, and position (goalkeeper is an option here). You can also customise the physical appearance of your player, but unlike in the console version of the game, you can't map your own face onto him--a strange omission given that the Vita has built-in cameras. Once you've got your player set up, you can use him throughout Career mode--and even the practice arena--building up his statistics and earning accomplishments.             "
1127,Farpoint,7.0,2,"The ""what” of Farpoint isn't as vital as the ""how.” Even among its virtual-reality-enabled peers, it's a fairly standard shooter about an unnamed space shuttle pilot who, along with two scientists, ends up stranded on an uncharted desert planet while investigating an anomaly near a wormhole orbiting Jupiter. When you wake up, you've got nothing but an assault rifle and your wits with which to face off against an ugly horde of arachnids. For much of the first half of the game, Farpoint is rudimentary, with linear--albeit pretty and atmospheric--desert corridors leading to open areas filled with enemies. Your weapons are shooter mainstays: an assault rifle and a shotgun, both with high-powered secondary rounds.It's only after the first boss fight that it becomes clear Farpoint is a late bloomer. The lethargic first area acts as a proof-of-concept demo for the PSVR Aim controller--an optional accessory that can be purchased as a bundle with the game. To Farpoint's detriment, it means anyone playing the game with a DualShock 4--Farpoint doesn't support PlayStation Move controllers--will be bored to tears before being torn apart by the game's nimble, vicious little beasts.For those who do splurge for the Aim, however, they'll find Farpoint's early hours show off all the slick ways the gun controller makes the difference between a boring game and an engaging one. Through the Aim, the otherwise lackluster desert corridors are a prime showcase for the kinetic motion and aiming that could only work in VR. One of the best tiny touches is the simulated holographic sight--modeled after real-world counterparts--that makes targeting encroaching enemies from a distance a more involved but satisfying process.Once you move past this tutorial-like section, Farpoint starts bringing its surprises out of the bag. The generic bug hunt in haunting, sunbathed landscapes gradually transitions into a pulse-pounding, run-and-gun nightmare scenario against a slew of unforgiving murder machines. The weapons take on a delightful alien bent, with a decidedly different heft and feel from the basic assault and shotgun options of the first half. With infinite ammo for all of them--only explosive rounds and rockets need refilling--you'll walk into any firefight comfortably.When bipedal aliens join the fight in the second half of the game, Farpoint becomes a true test of skill, and comes alive in a way the first half never hints at. Enemies suddenly know how to use cover, flank your position, and fire sniper rifles from afar. Sneaky killshots have to be carefully keyholed through minute gaps in wreckage with one eye closed and actual steady hand on the Aim controller. Alternatively, John Wick-style strolls down a corridor while blind-firing a shotgun and laying waste to a whole squad of enemies without breaking stride feels magnificent. Style and success in Farpoint are bound only by your own flexibility and guile.And yet, the biggest surprise the game has in store has nothing to do with the gunplay but the overarching plot involving the two scientists, Dr. Grant Moon and Dr. Eva Tyson, who crashed on the planet first. Time away from gunning down aliens is spent examining holographic records of the doctors' prior escapades. While this builds toward a somewhat predictable conclusion, the particulars are breathtaking in their poignancy; a tonal clash with the rest of the game. Eventually, every cutscene is a hard emotional swerve, and the ultimate fate of Drs. Moon and Tyson feels ripped from a much different, heartbreaking experience than an arcade VR shooter."
723,Baba Is You,7.0,2,"Baba is You has an appealing conceit. The basic gameplay resembles an '80s top-down puzzle title like Sokoban or Adventures of Lolo: you control a kind of sheep or rabbit character called Baba, who moves around a fixed environment, pushes objects, and pursues a goal. But many of the rules that govern the game--including what can be traversed, what can be moved, what’s hazardous, what’s the objective, and even what’s under your command--are represented on screen as blocks of text arranged into phrases that work as commands. These blocks can be manipulated and the phrases rearranged, empowering you to eliminate restrictions, neutralize threats, and redefine the conditions of victory. In this way, the solutions for the puzzles in Baba is You are found through rewriting the terms of each problem.Most words refer either to things (such as “wall”, “lava”, or “flag”) or to properties of things (such as “stop”, “push”, or “win”). When a thing is connected to a property with the verb “is,” that thing adopts that property, and can be modified with various conjunctions, prepositions, verbs, and adjectives, all of which follow the logic of a programming language. For example, suppose on a stage “Baba is you,” “flag is win,” and Baba and the flag are on opposite sides of a lake of lava. If “lava is hot” and “Baba is melt,” then Baba can’t pass the lava to reach the flag. But if “lava is push,” you can push the lava out of the way to reach the goal. Better yet, if “lava is you,” you can reach the flag as the lava, leaving Baba behind entirely.Baba is You is never better than in these moments of sudden realization--when it dawns on you that you can rewrite the rules and change, get rid of, or become the obstacle in your path, allowing you to figure out what can be done to solve a challenging puzzle. Most of these moments occur early on, as you familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics and start to understand the way that it wants you to approach its puzzles. Baba is You encourages lateral thinking by the nature of its design, and after 15 or 20 stages, you begin to get a feel for its peculiar problems and the oblique strategies they require. The game’s surprises are genuinely delightful, but they are primarily front loaded.The aesthetic is lo-fi in the extreme, though not without its charms. Its crude lines and simple blocks of color look like a child’s rendition of a NES game in crayon, every letter of the words that make up the commands scrawled in a shaky hand. In later, more complex puzzles, when instructions are crowding the screen and different objects are teeming all around you, scrutinizing this primitive style for clues can feel a bit like looking for codes in an abstract expressionist painting.Less successful is the music, which is bland, simplistic, and incredibly repetitive. Modeled after retro game soundtracks, it sounds like a poor approximation. It had such an adverse effect on my concentration that it wasn’t long before I muted it and listened to my own music.As the game progresses, and especially as the language involved gets more complex, words are ushered in whose meaning seems vague and whose purpose remains hazy, and that can make certain puzzles infuriatingly obscure.Baba is You is lean, stark, and conspicuously light on instruction. New words and conditions are introduced without commentary; what things mean is never explained, and how things function is yours to learn in practice. Such hard-lined rigor makes you feel your intelligence is being respected. It also has the tendency to leave you completely bewildered and confused. The genre’s best games aspire to teach you how to solve their puzzles as they are presented to you, parceling out crucial information elegantly, and subtly, as you proceed from one challenge to the next. The ideal is a kind of unspoken guidance, acquainting you with rules and parameters in a way that feels totally intuitive and clear.Baba is You doesn’t always do this so well. The earliest levels of its overworld map--including a preliminary stage that offers control prompts for how to navigate, undo actions, and reset--show a few simple approaches to the game’s unique brand of problem-solving. But as the game progresses, and especially as the language involved gets more complex, words are ushered in whose meaning seems vague and whose purpose remains hazy, and that can make certain puzzles infuriatingly obscure. It’s one thing to be confounded by a puzzle, and quite another to be uncertain how the puzzle works or what the puzzle wants. Often, I thought I knew what an ambiguous word did only to find that it didn’t actually do what I thought. More than once I solved a puzzle without understanding why.For instance, every level has a “you.” Usually it’s Baba, but it can also be a wall, flag, or a little red avatar called Keke. It’s clear almost immediately that you can assume control of any number of different objects by replacing the noun in the sentence that ends “is you,” and that, what’s more, something has to be defined as you in order to continue playing at all. Less clear to me was that “you” is always a property rather than a thing. This means that, while “Baba is win” can be a condition of victory, “win is you” and “you is win” are not. So much of the vernacular of the game I picked up only in fits and starts. For example, I only know from happening upon it that “crab and Baba is you” will allow you to control both a crab and Baba despite being grammatically incorrect, while something like “Baba is you is win” doesn't work as expected.This matters because you need some sense of why something does or doesn't work in a puzzle game in order to truly own your accomplishments. In one later puzzle, I managed to walk over a body of water unharmed by pushing a pillar into the water and stringing together the phrase “pillar on water is sink.” The property “sink” usually seems to make anything that touches the sinkable object disappear. I have no clue what happened here. Of course, I am sure this does “work out” in the technical sense, and that there is an explanation I’m simply not getting. But I shouldn't have to stumble through a fog of incomprehension in order to find the solution to a logic-based problem. Why does “box has box” clear a path through a lake of water? I couldn’t say, but I gathered it was what I had to do eventually. This feels fundamentally different than merely being stumped, and it doesn’t satisfy in remotely the same way.A-ha moments are precious things. Their relief can feel miraculous--but only so long as you understand what you’ve done and feel you’ve earned the victory. For the most part, Baba is You’s most brutal stages do offer this balance of challenge and reward. By puzzle 50--there are 200 in all--levels are flipping upside down, rules are compounded elaborately, and sentences are sprawling out to command things like “wall and hedge and key and flag is word,” to take one real late example. It can be torture, but of course in a puzzle game such torture is fun. Baba is You is among the most seriously arduous games of its kind I’ve played, and when its rules are clear and its instructions legible, it’s gratifying in a way only hardcore suffering can be."
796,Deracine,5.0,1,"Dark Souls creator FromSoftware is renowned for its vague, interpretative stories and captivating gameplay--two strengths of the studio that have been successfully applied to similarly styled games for nearly over a decade. Deracine is a departure from what the studio is primarily known for. It's a narrative adventure that makes good use of PlayStation VR and the immersive nature of the hardware but fails to consolidate a poorly structured story and mundane gameplay to create something truly special.Deracine puts you in control of an invisible Faerie who manifests in a mysteriously secluded boarding school that serves as a home to five children. You're summoned by one of the children, Yuliya, who believes in a Faeries' duty to guide and protect those in need with their ability to alter and traverse time, tasking you with looking over the other children at the school. Deracine's tale begins with innocent chores around the school, where you play simple pranks on the children in a bid to prove your existence. But its overarching narrative quickly starts exploring greater themes concerning life and its sacrifices, obsessions with the past and the morality surrounding the ability to change past events.It's a story that presents its ideas without much hand-holding, which combined with the frequent time jumps can create a difficult thread to follow. It can often feel like you have a grasp of where the narrative is heading before it completely flips itself again, introducing more characters and supernatural elements that undermine the overall story. The final two chapters are most guilty of this, tossing aside previously established themes and instead focusing on numerous jumps between two days in an attempt to explain these sudden additions. The repetitive nature of these chapters wear thin quickly and only confuse the narrative further, sadly undercutting the harrowing conclusion that desperately tries to tie everything together.As a Faerie, Deracine gives you two abilities to command with disappointing limitations. The first lets you glance at current objectives though a magical pocket watch, while also giving you the power to travel through time when the narrative allows it. The second is a glowing red ring that can absorb time from objects and beings around you. The earliest example of this has you transferring the limited time left on a ripe pair of grapes over to a wilted and dead flower, instantly rejuvenating and reviving it. This initially seems like a clever mechanic, but you rarely get to use it. You're only able to use it freely in two puzzles, and even then, the choices presented to you are too straightforward. It's a shame that more of Deracine's puzzle-solving couldn't be designed around this single intriguing mechanic, especially when you ponder how captivating it might have been to be given the chance to experiment with its power in smart settings.Each chapter takes place within a frozen moment in time, letting you explore the school at will and interact with both past and present versions of the children residing there. Translucent echoes of characters give you insight into past events and create a breadcrumb trail for you to follow back to their current locations for more context into their current actions. Past conversations play out after you manipulate certain objects around the house and on the children's persons, while larger changes to their surroundings culminate in short showings of how they react to your meddling. Deracine makes your impact on its world and characters felt with each action, even if it gives you little to no room for experimentation.Exploration is the gateway to Deracine's point-and-click-like puzzles, which have you hunting for items you'll need to advance stories during each chapter. This can be as simple as hunting down a key for a locked chest or as involved as figuring out a way to move a stubborn black cat from your path (since Faeries seem to fear the cute pets). Puzzles are all similar to one another and expect you to pay close attention to each of the conversations you stumble upon for vague clues to their solutions. Sometimes, these clues don't offer meaningful information, leading to infrequent but frustrating instances where you're stuck trying to use every item in your possession to elicit a response. But most of the time they delicately point you in the correct direction--not outright explaining what to do, but giving you enough to make your eventual solutions feel satisfying to orchestrate.Moving around Deracine's surprisingly large boarding school and accompanying grounds makes good use of existing VR systems of control. You're forced to use a pair of PlayStation Move controllers (since you'll be handling items frequently with your hands) but an intelligent combination of segmental rotation and teleportation makes getting around a breeze. You use two face buttons to rotate the camera through fixed angles and then use a third button on the right Move controller to teleport to any highlighted area within view. In instances where you need to take a closer look, you can get right up and close with the item in question, orbiting the camera around to give you whatever desired angle you might need. It doesn't take long to become comfortable with the control scheme, making its frequent exploration easy to engage with and comfortable during long sessions of play.Deracine does contain an impressive level of detail to its world, enrapturing you in a space that is primed for you to pick apart. Finely detailed objects give you insight into its lore, with the benefit of VR and motion controls letting you manipulate each item carefully to inspect its every detail. The ability to move around freely and engage without numerous objects within Deracine's world with your own hands is effective in making you feel exactly like the Faerie the children describe, which just wouldn't be the same with a traditional controller.Deracine has the buildings blocks of a good VR debut from Dark Souls creator FromSoftware, but it lacks the engrossing gameplay and mystique that has made the studio's previous titles so successful.Expressive animation also plays a big role in enriching the many character moments with a strong sense of emotion and personality. The boarding school and its surrounding forests are also beautiful, bathed in warm lighting and rich seasonal colors. It's contrasted by a delicate and somber score, which loops and changes with each scene to provide a serene backdrop to your adventuring. Silence is also used to great effect, creating an ominous atmosphere at key, powerful moments. With the immersive properties offered by virtual reality, Deracine is a technical treat on both eyes and ears.Deracine has the buildings blocks of a good VR debut from Dark Souls creator FromSoftware, but it lacks the engrossing gameplay and mystique that has made the studio's previous titles so successful. It is a good example of a PSVR-exclusive title that uses the medium effectively, giving you ample control over your movement and an enticing space to explore fully with the flexibility of using your own two hands to pick it apart. Its narrative ambitions fail to meet the same bar, though, with intriguing themes that get lost within a poorly constructed narrative that's difficult to follow. Its puzzles fall prey to the same inadequacies, failing to leverage the more exciting mechanics presented from the start and instead relying on trivial scavenger hunts though frozen time. Deracine is a disappointingly flawed adventure that won't likely stick with you long after its conclusion."
612,Sayonara Wild Hearts,6.0,1,"Playing Sayonara Wild Hearts' best levels is an intangible, hard-to-describe feeling. When the art, the movement, and the music all come together in a track, it's absolutely captivating. But it's also fleeting, and I spent the majority of my time playing Sayonara Wild Hearts chasing that feeling. It came through in a few standout levels, but for most of the game, I found myself on the verge of falling in love with songs only to fall short of that high.It's an interesting kind of music game. The main goal is to simply flow with the music, rather than hit a series of precise rhythm-based inputs or dance along to beats. Crystalline hearts line the paths you ride (or fly) through, and often, following the hearts is the best way to get through a level safely without scrambling to avoid oncoming obstacles. Timed inputs are reserved for flashier moves--big jumps, deft dodges, graceful attacks--and these sequences are all scripted, so all you have to do is hit the button somewhat on time and then watch as the moves play out to the music. The camera and forward movement, including your speed, are automatic, too, leaving you to move only from side to side with rare exception. This all lends Sayonara Wild Hearts a dreamlike feel; you are both participant and observer, somewhat in control but mostly just along for the ride.Initially, the dreaminess of Sayonara Wild Hearts is enchanting. The scripted moves, which often come during fight sequences against brightly colored antagonists, have a distinct magical-girl flair. Dodging an attack becomes a balletic leap, a flurry of punches culminates in an explosion of color, and even punch-induced vomit (in one level) is so colorful and abstract that it flows seamlessly with the overall aesthetic. Some levels are bathed in electric neons, while others are more pensive, dark blue interdimensional affairs. And yet all of them, even at their most bright and exciting, are tinged with melancholy, largely due to the heartbreak-infused pop soundtrack--it's the kind of music that, if it were to come on in a bar, would make you feel incredibly lonely but also kind of like dancing.When this all works together, it really works. My favorite level, Dead of Night, closely matches the music with the action and, as a result, the song has impact. During the buildup, you ride your motorcycle through the forest, weaving between trees and picking up hearts while all is calm. Ahead of you are four masked enemies; they strike a group pose, and then, right as the drop hits, their three-headed wolf tank appears and the mini-boss-like sequence begins. You slide side to side to dodge attacks, then hit X with the prompt to leap over the tank as the music swells. It's timed beautifully, and you feel a sort of abstract sadness as the singer belts, ""I'm the only one alive in the dead of night,"" and the tank slides, defeated, on the forest floor. You've ""won,"" but it's bittersweet.Most of the levels, however, aren't as finely tuned. A lot of times, the timing-based moves feel offbeat, like you should hit them a moment or two early or late to really be in-time with the music--or like they aren't really set to the tempo at all. It makes it hard to get into a lot of the songs, even though the soundtrack as a whole is excellent, and distracts from the overall spectacle of a level--you have to watch the prompts' visual cues rather than listen for the right timing most of the time.Movement, too, can disrupt the flow of things. It can be hard to line yourself up properly for hearts, turns, and jumps; you might find yourself a little bit to the right or left of where you thought you'd be. This is largely caused by the independent camera, which sometimes leaves you blind going into turns or unsure of how obstacles and collectibles will line up. The highly stylized, dreamy feel of each level also leaves some ambiguity as to the placement of things. I found myself wishing there were either fewer obstacles or tighter controls; while the flowy feel of moving side to side fits the aesthetic perfectly, it's hard to stay in the zone when you're constantly tipping the analog sticks slightly to better line yourself up.Each level continues into the next not like tracks on an album would, but with short breaks in between. On top of that, the main story mode kicks you to the menu after each level to see your score and select the next song. There is a seamless mode of these same levels in the extras section, and the broken-up structure lends itself well to mobile or handheld play--but the story is the first mode you're introduced to, and it's only about the length of a long album. Where you might listen to an album all the way through at least once before jumping around and picking songs, you do the opposite in Sayonara Wild Hearts, and that saps it of its momentum.On repeat playthroughs, I found myself getting more and more used to Sayonara Wild Hearts' quirks and better appreciating each level as I gained the muscle memory for them. Only a few hit me like Dead of Night did, and those levels are stellar. But the rest are either forgettable or somehow discordant, whether because of movement issues or strange timing. I wanted to get lost in the daydream it presented, but I kept getting ripped back to reality, just a bit more melancholic than when I started."
162,Saints Row,6.0,1,"It's been nine years since Saints Row IV was released, pitting the 3rd Street Saints against an alien invasion that featured superpowers, time-travel, Matrix-style simulations, and the complete destruction of Earth. Where do you go after a game so ridiculous and outlandish? After a period of absence, rebooting the series sounds like a logical next step, and that's exactly what developer Deep Silver Volition has done with this new, stripped-back Saints Row.It's still not ""realistic"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it is slightly more grounded. However, you still shouldn't envisage finding many of the modern trappings of open-world games. For as much as Saints Row differentiates itself from the bombast of its past few entries, it still closely resembles a game from the same era, leading to an experience that often feels stale and dated.For the most part, this isn't something you could level at Saints Row IV's approach to freedom around character identity and gender, and this has carried over into the rebooted Saints Row. The character creator lets you design pretty much any person you want. There's a broad range of prosthetic options, various types of vitiligo, a number of sliders for body options that do away with binary gender selection, a choice of six distinct voices, and the ability to make an asymmetrical face, to name just a few of the available options. You can also hop back into the character creator at any point and change your entire look. This sounds like an insignificant feature, but it isn't always a given and speaks to Saints Row's focus on inclusivity.You can create a character that represents you, or simply delve into some of the more eccentric customization options and devise a creation with metal skin, demonic eyes, and glowing red hair. There are already some fairly accurate recreations of Shrek being shared, just to give you an idea of how exhaustive the process is.Once you've finished creating your ideal gang boss, you're thrown into a story centered around four young friends who share a dingy apartment and commit crimes to try and make rent. Saints Row adopts an anti-capitalist stance and touches on some socially conscious issues throughout its first few hours, with characters bemoaning their crippling student debt and lack of health insurance, while also taking a satirical swipe at toxic corporate culture. Alluding to these issues makes the cast somewhat relatable, but it doesn't take long before you're building a criminal empire and discarding these topics in favor of more outlandish endeavors.While the main character is a self-described murder machine, the rest of your friends are well-rounded and avoid falling into a pitfall of homicidal archetypes. The perpetually shirtless Kev, for instance, is obsessed with food and music, regularly talking about the kitchen appliances he hopes to buy when not busy DJing a party. Neena, on the other hand, is a mechanic who loves restoring classic cars but also has an appreciation for art and an interest in gallery curation. Then there's Eli, the strategist and aspirational entrepreneur of the group. He's averse to violence but spends his off-hours LARPing in the desert and shooting like-minded individuals with foam bullets.The heart of Saints Row has always resided in its characters, and the dynamic and playful banter between the friendship group is the highlight of the story. They may be violent criminals, but they're the kinds of people you wouldn't mind hanging out with and provide a bright spot in an otherwise unfulfilling narrative. The overarching plot is fairly boilerplate and plays out as you would expect. It's anticlimactic, too, as most problems are solved with relative ease, adversaries are simply dealt with, and more than a few loose ends remain unresolved. After the previous two numbered games in the series were imbued with such creativity, it's disappointing that the storytelling in this reboot is so humdrum.While the story does touch on some modern social trends, the gameplay feels dated. Much of Saints Row feels like a throwback to the open-world design of a decade ago. Its third-person shooting is adequate, but it's tough to get a good feel for the aiming when playing on a controller. The reticle is always slightly too finicky, even after fiddling with the sensitivity settings to try and find a sweet spot. It's something I grew accustomed to over time, but the best way to approach combat is by making liberal use of the auto-aiming assistance that locks onto targets when aiming down sights. This makes it easier to execute headshots and trigger the satisfying splat that accompanies them.The arsenal of weapons at your disposal is rather lackluster, however. There's the usual assortment of pistols, SMGs, and shotguns, but there's little reason to deviate from the starting assault rifle. The inaccuracy of the SMGs only compounds the game's awkward aiming, and the shotguns feel decidedly weak and are irritatingly slow to fire--an issue when most enemies soak up damage. The base assault rifle excels in any situation, so it quickly became my go-to for the majority of the game, especially since neither of the upgrades for it were all that appealing due to their slower rate of fire.Fortunately, the addition of whimsical skill moves does spruce up combat quite a bit. By completing missions and earning experience points, you level up along a linear progression path where each level unlocks a new skill move. You can assign up to four at once and utilize them in combat by killing enemies to accrue the Flow points you need to activate them. These points fill back up relatively quickly, so it's unlikely you'll ever be left wanting for a chance to use one of these skills.The first one you unlock lets you grab an enemy and stuff a grenade down their pants before heaving them back towards their buddies, which is especially useful for crowd control, on top of just being fun to do. Other skills range from a powerful flaming punch to an anti-gravity device that launches enemies into the air and leaves them defenseless. The standard weapons are lacking, but these skills add some much-needed variety to combat that shake up the familiar routine.For the most part, these skills also incentivize you to push the attack and mix it up in combat, and this is something the game factors into its health system. Your health bar is divided into separate chunks. Your health will recharge automatically if you don't sustain damage for a few seconds, but it will only refill up to the nearest checkpoint--whether that's one-third of your health, two-thirds of your health, and so on. To get more health back, you need to kill enemies by getting up close and performing a stylish execution. You can only use these cinematic takedowns once before the ability needs to charge, but kills recharge the meter much more quickly, so you're encouraged to create mayhem in order to better heal yourself.There's no cover system, only a roll that can help you avoid weapon fire, so combat is all about staying on the front foot and being aggressive to survive. It's at its best when things are frantic and you're overwhelmed by enemies converging on you from all sides. This happens more often on higher difficulties, but the checkpoints in campaign missions are so unforgiving that the tradeoff doesn't seem worth it.When not shooting people, most of your time is spent behind the wheel of various vehicles. Driving in Saints Row feels overly floaty, but this was never a hindrance to my enjoyment of cruising around the city. There's a dedicated drift button that lets you swerve around corners with ease, and the addition of a sideswipe attack makes vehicular combat more exciting. Having to shoot and drive at the same time has never felt good in these types of open-world games, so being able to shunt cars off the road and watch them explode in a fiery blaze is a marked improvement on what's come before.It helps, of course, that the fictional city of Santo Ileso is so visually appealing, mixing towering skyscrapers with quiet suburbs and large swaths of desert. Set in the United States' Southwest, it calls to mind places such as Albuquerque and Reno while being distinctly its own. You can see the influence of Mexican culture in some of its architecture and the beautiful murals adorning certain buildings, while the neon lights of its casinos cast a seedier vibe. It's a shame, then, that the city doesn't produce the emergent action that would give it life. This goes back to the game's archaic feel, where you spend much of your time simply driving back and forth between missions.A significant part of Saints Row's campaign revolves around various Criminal Ventures. Once your startup is up and running, you can purchase these ventures to generate more money and gradually grow your business. You start off with a car dealership before being able to acquire a restaurant, laundromat, toxic waste disposal service, and more. Obviously, each one is a front for illicit activity, and it's your job to help out with that side of the business.You need to steal food trucks full of drugs for the Chalupacabra restaurant, for example, while the car dealership tasks you with jacking specific vehicles around the city. These missions initially seem optional, providing you with another avenue to earn some cash. Before long, however, your progress through the campaign is gated by missions that require you to have purchased and completed a number of these Criminal Ventures. I always had multiple missions available, so it never felt like this halted my progress; the main issue is that these ventures are decidedly milquetoast.Each one usually involves driving from A to B with only minor variations between them. Sometimes you're being chased, other times you have to avoid the police by dodging their big red circles on the mini-map. Either way, it's a lot of driving from point to point, over and over again, and it doesn't take long to become tedious. Some of the ventures offer a little variety, like the clothing brand that asks you to take pictures of different materials, or the medical clinic where you commit insurance fraud by throwing yourself into moving vehicles. The latter has featured throughout the series before and is the best of the bunch; the rest are just bland.The traditional story missions add more impetus by engaging in action-movie hijinks, but the mission design still feels like a relic of the past. One early mission sees you assaulting a convoy by leaping from car to car to make it up the line. This sounds like an exciting set-piece, but in practice, you're just shooting static enemies before watching a short cutscene of your character making an untroubled jump. These missions are still enjoyable at times, but there's always this nagging feeling of déjà vu because it all feels so familiar.Even when its creativity shines, it's let down on the gameplay side. One of the Criminal Ventures you can purchase involves Eli's Mad Max-inspired LARPing exploits. These missions are combat-focused and stand out because everyone is committed to role-playing. Your previously violent executions now consist of fake punches and pretend-chest-bursting, and your arsenal is replaced by toy weapons that fire foam projectiles. Later on, there's a giant cardboard worm that knocks people over with its roar, and there's an excellent recreation of the greatest death scene in movie history. I loved everything about this quest line except playing it. Despite all of these changes, combat is very much the same, only you're forced to use bad weapons that take twice as long to kill people. Saints Row has a lot of good ideas, but it restricts itself by not being ambitious enough from a gameplay perspective.It's also worth noting the open-world jank that comes with the territory. There's everything from characters that appear as floating heads to NPCs getting stuck in walls, broken vehicle physics, and enemy AI falling apart to the point where they don't realize you're there. For the most part, these are minor oddities that don't significantly hamper the game, but I also ran into a few more serious issues. During one mission, the scripting failed and left me trapped with no door to go through, while restarting at the nearest checkpoint caused the game to crash. There was another instance where a vehicle I had to destroy was indestructible, and a few other cases where a mission wouldn't progress.Saints Row reins in the absurdity to a fairly significant degree but still manages to indulge in some of the chaotic action and silly hijinks the series is known for. Its story is simple and fairly predictable, yet spending time with its diverse and well-rounded characters makes it worth seeing through to the end. It's a shame the gameplay isn't quite as progressive, opting instead for out-of-date mechanics and level design. Combat is decent, and the story missions are enjoyable when at their most over-the-top, but there's too much bland filler in between. Rebooting the series made sense, yet in many ways, Saints Row is still stuck in the past and struggling to live up to its legacy."
3162,Hard Corps: Uprising,7.0,2,"is Contra…almost. This action-intensive 2D shooter dips heavily into the well of the classic shoot-'em-up series' past for inspiration, going so far as to feature character and story tie-ins to Contra: Hard Corps on the Sega Genesis. If the unmistakable opening prog-metal guitar riff and the frenzy of bullets that erupt from the get-go aren't a dead giveaway, the game's sadistic difficulty should be enough to jog your memory. Uprising adds a fail-safe or two to make its brutal eight-stage gauntlet of unending death somewhat playable for newcomers, but this retro throwback should come with a coupon for a free session of anger management classes.        This spiritual prequel to the similarly titled 1994 Sega Genesis game casts you in the reprised role of Colonel Bahamut, a former villain who has now taken to battling an evil empire of clown-masked soldiers and mechanical drones run by a futuristic dictator. Aside from a cool anime intro sequence, the story unfolds in brief text snippets that serve as a simple distraction during the game's lengthy loading screens. The Contra franchise has always been about raw arcade-style action, and Uprising doesn't disappoint in that department. You're dropped into the fray with guns blazing and offered immediate gratification as you run left and right, churning through droves of masked soldiers, flying robots, gun encampments, and nasty alien beasts. Familiar gun power-ups such as lasers, spread cannons, machine guns, rocket launchers, and flamethrowers help pleasantly speed foes to their graves. However, your own death rears its ugly head fast and frequently, even if you possess godlike reflexes. Some games are hard. Other games are ridiculously hard. Uprising's harsh difficulty curve manages to wildly overshoot such paltry levels of sadism and ventures instead into the magical realm of the purely ridiculous.     Each of the game's eight stages is lengthy and packed with minimal checkpoints and multiple boss battles. Successfully battling through the first level alone is a daunting task, and your threshold for anguish and frustration will determine which mode to play. Uprising's default Arcade mode is strictly for Contra purists. With meager health, three lives, and very little in the way of extra abilities, it offers an undiluted experience--one that makes you want to hurl your console through the TV screen. Rising mode is much more manageable. While it starts you out with limited health, only a few lives, and some basic abilities, every kill you make earns you points that can be spent unlocking new power-ups that help you push deeper into the game. You can buy extra lives, additional continues, more health, dash maneuvers, speed enhancements, and other crucial boosts. These upgrades take some of the sting out of plowing through a tough level only to die at the stage's last boss battle, since you keep your accumulated points until they're spent. A certain amount of grinding is required early on, but unlocking perks makes it a little easier to progress. Going alone is far more arduous than tackling the game with a friend in local or online two-player co-op. Playing with a teammate cuts down on a portion of the frustration. Having an extra gun on your side is useful on its own, though some of the trickier platforming stages later in the game require careful communication and near-perfect timing for both players to make it through in one piece.        A brisk challenge can be a great thing, but the insidious stage designs start off pretty brutal and grow exceptionally wickeder as you progress. This can make Uprising hard to stomach at times. Only one or two checkpoints are woven into the lengthy levels, and being forced to repeat a mid-stage boss battle you just struggled through because you ran out of lives only seconds after completing it is maddening. As spectacular as the boss encounters are, there are usually two or three per stage, and each boss often has multiple versions for you to defeat before it goes down for good. Regular enemies are no pushovers either. While common weaker foes take only a bit of your life away (and any weapon you have equipped), you encounter snipers that dish out one-hit kills, plants that spew life-draining poison, and other nastiness early on in the game. Things get worse from there. Throw in some sporadic platforming sections that require an inhuman level of precision, and it's tough to hold off the desire to snap the controller in half. Jumping back and forth to ride on detonating missiles rocketing upward through a massive elevator shaft is a very cool idea, but it's too difficult to be enjoyable. The grating metal soundtrack and awful voice-overs don't help when concentration is the key to your survival.      Despite its many cheap shots and frustrating moments, Uprising is a highly creative animal that changes constantly and keeps you on your toes. The beautiful hand-drawn art style has a pleasant anime vibe that updates the otherwise classic run-and-gun gameplay. Not only does each stage offer a stark visual contrast from the previous one, but they also throw in new and unexpected twists that break up the flow. Aside from hoofing it, you spend time riding a turbo-charged bike, battling away on a futuristic train network, boating along a river while blasting a giant mecha-sub, and riding missiles in space. While it'll probably be one of the most rage-inducing games you'll play this year, this Contra cousin rewards patient and skilled players with a nonstop glut of jaw-dropping, action-soaked moments.

2349,Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3,6.0,1,"               Outside of the single-player campaign, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 lets you mix it up with other players locally and online. The online play functions well and allows you to jump into ranked or unranked matches and to set up tournaments for up to eight players. As with story battles, the accessibility and the impressive visuals make fighting against other players enjoyable from the get-go, but the simplicity of the action prevents it from holding your interest for long. The fighting system doesn't allow for much of a nuanced, tactical approach, and so your online opponents tend to spam the same few powerful attacks over and over again. It becomes routine and predictable quickly, and the prospect of unlocking more titles and images for your ninja info card (a profile that is made visible to and traded with your opponents) isn't a compelling reason to soldier on. This game is only for those who care to see Naruto's story continue to play out, and though it has its moments, it doesn't deliver quite the level of excitement you'd hope for from a game bearing the Naruto Shippuden name.

675,Imperator: Rome,5.0,1,"The latest grand strategy game from the genre's current leading light, Paradox Interactive, puts you at the helm of one of the great powers of the late 4th century B.C. and asks you to conquer the world from western Europe to southern Asia. At the same time, it can also leave you in charge of one of the region's meekest tribes and ask you to accomplish little more than its survival. Regardless of your chosen nation, Imperator: Rome is a stubbornly single-minded strategy experience that borrows freely from its Paradox stablemates (Europa Univeralis, Hearts of Iron, and Crusader Kings), culls much of their personality and complexity, and marches into battle with a steely-eyed focus on military conquest.At heart, Imperator: Rome is a game about building armies and marching them into foreign lands. You recruit troops, secure the strategic resources necessary to recruit upgraded troops, assign generals, point them towards the target, and let them loose. There are technologies to research, civic matters to pursue, and religious concerns, but these are secondary factors, each just another gear in the military machine.Combat is intuitive and uncomplicated. Armies are routed when their morale breaks, while strict supply costs in each territory work well to prevent amassing units in ludicrous ""stacks of doom."" Meanwhile, the need to lay siege to an enemy fort for up to several in-game months at a time helps to put the brakes on any notion of steamrolling. You can holler the occasional tactical instruction, but when it comes down to it, the winner in battle will be whoever has the greater numbers. And if your opponent has the terrain advantage then you're going to need an even greater numerical advantage to overcome it.While I definitely prefer a strategic game that offers varied paths to victory, there is a simple pleasure in Imperator: Rome's rigid insistence that all you have to do is paint the map the same colour. You don't have to play as Rome, of course, but it does make things more straightforward. Your choice of nation is a de facto difficulty slider, with Rome (situated among compliant vassals and easily overrun neutral states) offering a gentle introduction and Phrygia (larger than Rome but riven with internal division and despised by its neighbors) tossing you right in at the deep end. There are hundreds of nations from which to select, spanning half the globe from Britain to North Africa to Scandinavia to Sri Lanka, and you can play as any of them. More than a difficulty setting, however, your choice of nation sets expectations.Rome is well-known, though not as well-known as Macedon or Egypt, and so the effects of its actions will be felt further and wider, rippling out in diplomatic waves over the Mediterranean and drawing condemnation or perhaps congratulations from its rivals. As a major power, you've got weight to throw around, but other powers take notice and react, adding their own weight to the scale. The result is a world that feels dynamic and connected, at least to the extent that you can appreciate territories on the political map flipping back and forth between your own nation's color and those of your enemies.When playing as a smaller nation, though, you have no weight at all. You control very little territory, you've got a tiny army, and your choices are extremely limited. The world most likely doesn't even realize you exist. If they do, it's probably because they just noticed you have something they want, or worse, you're merely a slight speedbump on the way to what they want. Played in this way, Imperator: Rome feels oddly timid, an unsatisfying waiting game momentarily brought to life through tentative forays into expansion while you hope no one important notices.The asymmetry of the starting positions, and the resulting diplomatic relations maintained by each nation at the outset, lend variety to the early stages of each new game. Beyond that, though, the heavy focus on military conquest and lack of options in both empire management and international relations place severe limits on the breadth and depth of strategic tinkering available to the player.A major problem is the implementation of Paradox's ""mana"" system, as it is colloquially known. These are the pools of resources--military power, research, oratory power, and religion--you accumulate over the course of the game and which fund many of the decisions you make. Mana increases as you play, based almost entirely on the randomly rolled stats of your leader and those you have appointed to your government. When you have saved enough, you can spend it on extra discipline for your troops, a small income boost, or any number of so-called technologies.The pacing is all over the place, though. You can hit pause, buy up a bunch of diverse tech, and unpause--and in an instant, your empire is improving its diplomatic relations or collecting more tax. It feels backwards, like you're not planning toward something by investing in a particular resource to work toward a strategic objective, but rather slapping band-aids on immediate problems. It's not even that Imperator wants you to focus on short-term issues, it's more that the game is quite content to let you snap your fingers to magically make problems disappear.Religious power is the most undernourished of the mana resources. Aside from a very minor buff you can apply every five in-game years, the chief use of religious power is to preserve the stability of your empire--itself a nebulous status that imparts positive or negative modifiers to your loyalty, popularity, and so on--by making a sacrifice to the gods. This dramatic-sounding gesture involves clicking a button to convert a variable amount of religious power into one stability point. That's it. And suddenly the empire is stable again.Indeed, there's a lot that can simply be flipped on a dime. On the surface, the diplomatic game looks sophisticated. You can send gifts and insults to other empires, form alliances or undermine a rival's current regime by supporting rebels, and more. Managing diplomatic ties across dozens of relations should require balancing a host of competing interests, and at times the systems here do allow for such finesse. But at other times you can flip a switch, spend some oratory power, and now Armenia doesn't mind that you've fabricated a claim on Albania. It's all very ""Friendship ended with Scythia, now Carthage is my best friend!""Elsewhere, lots of small choices add up to very little. When establishing that trade route, do you want to secure access to fish and the 0.02% population growth bonus? Or would you prefer to import precious metals and gain 0.01 loyalty in your provinces? It's difficult to look at such numbers and understand how a particular choice might benefit your overall strategy. So you pick one, cross your fingers, and, in all likelihood, forget about it for the rest of the game. Rulers ought to feel the weight of their decisions, and few such choices here hit heavily.Imperator: Rome feels undercooked. As it stands, it's a strange mish-mash of several of Paradox's existing (and, let's be honest, superior) games without much to distinguish or recommend it. Paradox recently outlined a ""One Year Plan"" for the title in an effort to reassure players that they are aware of its shortcomings and intend to address them. That roadmap appears insubstantial to my eyes, but we'll see when we get there. For now, Imperator: Rome remains a decidedly modest strategy game."
75,EA Sports PGA Tour,7.0,2,"EA Sports PGA Tour is unlike any other golf game I've played. It still features familiar elements from the series' past--back when Tiger Woods was front and center--such as slow-motion heartbeat moments and climactic power shots. But after an eight-year hiatus from the world of golf simulation, EA has returned to the fairway with a more demanding recreation of the sport that's as much about feel as it is mastering the game's robust mechanics. With 30 courses covering all four majors--including The Masters at Augusta National--EA Sports PGA Tour has a plethora of golfing action to sink your teeth into. It's just a shame there are a few notable issues in critical areas that hold it back from greatness.The first of these is the game's swing mechanic. If you've played a golf game before, the actual act of swinging a driver or 5-iron will be familiar. You pull down on the analog stick to bring the club back, then push forward again to unleash your shot. This has been a staple in golf games for a number of years now, and there aren't any alternatives at the moment--not until a three-click system is implemented in a later update. The issue with EA Sports PGA Tour is that there's a slight delay between your input and the on-screen visual. Your swing isn't 1:1, so there's an uneasy disconnect where you never quite feel like you're in total control. The general malaise of each swing doesn't help matters either, with the slow, clunky pacing and frustrating lag making it difficult to nail the timing and power of each shot. I eventually grew accustomed to these idiosyncrasies over time, but it never feels quite right and fails to capture the satisfaction that hitting a 300-yard tee shot should achieve.To compound the issue, EA Sports PGA Tour also lacks any sort of meaningful tutorial. There are tooltips that pop up and cover the basics the first time you play, but these brief snippets barely scratch the surface of everything going on under the hood. Instead, the game has a suite of challenges that happen to include a Coaching Academy. This is the best place to start, even if these challenges still neglect to offer any tips or feedback to help you along the way. What you get is a variety of contextual situations covering different aspects of the sport, from putting downhill to dealing with elevation changes and the multitude of shot types on offer. There's a lot of trial and error involved, but the repetition of replaying each situation does give you a greater understanding of how everything works. It's not a very user-friendly approach, but it sets expectations and is genuinely helpful in an unconventional way, even if it might prove frustrating for some. Plus, completing these challenges also earns you XP that can be used to improve your created character.EA Sports PGA Tour's career mode sits front and center, starting off with your no-name golfer competing in the qualifying school before moving on to the amateur Korn Ferry Tour. The ultimate goal is to reach the PGA Tour, which can be done either by winning one of the many four-round courses or by placing highly enough in the Korn Ferry rankings come season's end. You can expedite this process by opting for a quick play mode where you only need to play a few holes rather than an entire round, but I think playing full rounds is the way to go. That's mostly because it gives you ample time to fine-tune your skills, learn the courses, and gain a better understanding of the game's mechanics. There's also a palpable sense of progression that comes from leveling up your golfer. Earning XP lets you build your skills in driving, approach play, short game, and putting, while progressing each attribute also unlocks more shot types, giving you additional options when preparing to send the ball careening toward the green.Fortunately, the Coaching Academy includes challenges for each of the game's myriad shot types, giving you the opportunity to see how each one functions before playing competitively. There's value in understanding the differences between a runner, spinner, or knock-down shot, but knowing when to utilize each one essentially comes down to a matter of feel. In this respect, EA Sports PGA Tour resembles the sport of golf more accurately than any other game. There are a number of variables at play for every single shot, to the point where there's a real thought process behind each swing. You have to choose the right shot type and club for each situation, adjust for wind and elevation, judge how much power you need to put into the swing, and account for the distinct ways each course plays--tweaking your shot shape depending on the shape of the fairway and lie of the bunkers. The game helps to some degree by displaying relevant information such as wind speed and distance, but then you're left to your own devices. This can be frustrating, particularly early on when you're still learning the ropes and your golfer's attributes aren't up to snuff, but once everything clicks, EA Sports PGA Tour plays an engrossing game of golf that can be incredibly rewarding.Much of this is down to the courses themselves. Every single one of the 30 officially licensed courses is staggeringly beautiful and offers an authentic attention to detail, whether it's Liberty National and its view of the Manhattan skyline, the waves crashing against the sand at Pebble Beach, or the alligators lurking in the water at TPC Sawgrass. Almost every course is iconic on some level, and they've all been faithfully rendered and recreated, right down to individual blades of grass. The absence of a course designer is a tad disappointing, but unlike PGA Tour 2K23, it's not something that feels like a necessity because there are already so many 18-hole delights. The courses are the game's main character, providing the kind of variety and depth to stave off any tedium. Mastering a golf game's mechanics is usually the key to success, but EA Sports PGA Tour's courses demand much more from you. Each one plays differently, whether it's the roll of the green or the width of the fairway impacting your decision-making. It genuinely feels like you're playing against the course rather than the shot meter.The physics model, which is built around the official TrackMan data for ball tracking and swing analysis, is excellent for the most part. However, there are some inconsistencies when it comes to ball rollout. On The Old Course at St Andrews, for instance, the rollout is overly extreme to the point where the ball will roll uphill at pace, even through heavy rough. This forces you to account for situations that shouldn't really occur. Once you land on the green, putting is also equally aggravating for different reasons. Each green contains a grid that uses moving beads to show you the direction of the break. The problem is that sometimes this data is inaccurate and the break is opposite to what the beads are showing. The putt reader alleviates this somewhat by showing the ideal path to the hole, but this is also misleading at times. With no reliable way to gauge the breaks, putting is a lesson in irritation that will only be rectified if these issues are fixed in future updates.Outside of career mode, EA Sports PGA Tour also features various tournament options for use in online matches against the community. If you want to play against friends, however, stroke play is the only option, and there's a disappointing lack of alternating play for those who want to see each other tee off. A range of daily, weekly, and seasonal tournaments give you another chance to earn XP and items like club specs and in-game cash for a limited time before they're refreshed, so there's an incentive to keep coming back. That in-game cash can be spent in a store of rotating items including various cosmetics, which holds some appeal because the character creator is extremely barebones. Outfitting your golfer in branded clothing can be fairly costly, though, which is explained by the inclusion of microtransactions for those who would rather buy the in-game currency with real money. This isn't a surprising move, but it doesn't exactly vibe with the serene mood.After almost a decade away from the sport, EA's return to the golf course is a promising one. The range of shot types, courses, and tangible variables make for a methodical and tactical game of golf that's both challenging and rewarding. It stumbles by barely introducing players to its robust mechanics, while a laggy swing and inconsistent putting are notable flaws on what is otherwise a fantastic golf sim. EA Sports PGA Tour represents a solid re-entry for the series and lays down a sturdy foundation for an auspicious future."
3879,The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon (2008),5.0,1,"  When he first debuted on the scene just over 10 years ago, Spyro the lovable purple dragon starred in a series of truly excellent platformers on the original PlayStation. But oh, how the fire-breathing have fallen. The first two entries in his current trilogy, The Legend of Spyro, have been marked by mediocrity, and sadly, the conclusion follows suit. It's an unfocused, uninteresting game that, despite its flying heroes, never manages to get off the ground.         Picking up where The Eternal Night left off, Dawn of the Dragon concludes the Legend of Spyro series with an extremely run-of-the-mill tale of our purple hero, accompanied by nemesis-turned-ally Cynder, taking on the Dark Master Malefor. It all makes for a typical wrap-up to a fantasy trilogy. Dawn of the Dragon certainly looks like the climactic chapter of an epic fantasy trilogy, too, and not just any epic fantasy trilogy. Specifically, it takes more than a little visual inspiration from the Lord of the Rings films. This influence is frequent and undeniable, from the initial confrontation with a massive fire-breathing demon of the deep, to a desperate battle against the siege towers of tremendous armies from the ramparts of a pristine city, to the foray into a scorched land dominated by a volcano above which the Dark Master resides. And as Spyro, Elijah Wood has some distinctly Frodo-esque lines of dialogue. While not very original, the visual design, coupled with a gorgeous musical score, is effective at creating the sense that the fate of the world hangs in the balance of Spyro's struggle. Unfortunately, the gameplay falls well short of matching that level of excitement.     The combat in Dawn of the Dragon has you employing a combination of weak and strong melee attacks, an assortment of elemental powers, and the ability to grab smaller enemies in your adorable little jaws and thrash them around. You can also guard against attacks and perform a quick roll to evade them. Despite this variety of moves at your disposal, the combat is never interesting. In the earlier parts of the game, you'll often fight so many weak enemies at once that the screen becomes a cluster of chaos, making it all but impossible to tell when an attack is incoming. Not that you need to be defensive, though, since pure button mashing is enough to defeat these foes. Later on, you'll frequently be waylaid by groups of larger, more powerful enemies. Much too frequently, in fact. These enemies are dull and require no particular skill to defeat, but they can take a long time to wear down, and they kill the game's momentum and make the last few chapters feel like an uphill slog.      The few boss battles look monumental, but they're simple and unimaginative. You avoid the same obvious patterns and exploit the same weaknesses over and over again. And worst of all, there are some so-called elite enemies scattered throughout the game who are wickedly frustrating. When you encounter one for the first time, you're given no clue how to defeat him, and initially, they may seem downright impossible. Even when, through trial and error, you stumble on the trick to beating them, they do so much damage that sometimes one slipup on your part can cost you your life. It's true that fighting elites is always optional, but you'll often earn some useful rewards for defeating them, such as pieces of armor that give Spyro's or Cynder's abilities a bonus, providing an incentive to just suck up the frustration and deal with the chore of fighting them. Lousy content is lousy content, optional or not, and the elites may frustrate and alienate some of the younger players to whom the game appeals.        Both Spyro and Cynder have four elemental powers, and some of them are fun to use for a little while: Cynder's wind power lets you pick up an enemy and fling him into his companions, and Spyro's electricity power can leave some foes stunned and open to attack for a moment. And powering up these abilities over the course of the game can be satisfying. Spyro's fire-breathing ability looks pretty powerful to begin with, but after you use the experience points you've earned to purchase its final upgrade, it's far more impressive. However, because the combat in which you employ these powers is never involving, the powers themselves are redundant, and switching them up isn't enough to keep things interesting.     Dawn of the Dragon departs from the earlier games in the series by letting you take flight at any time. A few presses of the jump button have you take to the air, but this new ability doesn't end up having much of an impact on the overall gameplay. It's useful for covering larger distances, but there are always gusts of wind and other mysterious forces that prevent you from exploiting this freedom, so you'll still have to do a fair amount of platforming. The game sometimes tries to do too much with flight. One sequence in particular has you zooming through the cavernous innards of a giant to strike at its crystalline heart, and like so much of the game, it looks thrilling but just isn't much fun to play. The flight controls are fine for gliding gently across the levels, but they lack the precision that a sequence like this calls for.        It's a good thing you have a way of getting around faster, though, because the level design is often so unfocused that you'll need to spend a good deal of time wandering and searching for where you're supposed to go next. One level requires you to first find one cave, then another, and then another, and while the area isn't enormous, it's large enough that you can spend quite a while looking until you stumble upon your next objective. (According to the manual, your dragonfly companion, Sparx, ""is always willing to help Spyro and Cynder find their way when they get lost."" No greater lie has ever been told.) Later, you'll soar all over the huge body of the aforementioned giant looking for a number of small crystals you need to destroy, and again, you may spend a good bit of time looking all over the place until you find your next objective. A bit of open-ended exploration can be fun, but levels like these could have benefited from the occasional nudge in the right direction.     Spyro and Cynder can never get too far apart, thanks to a cursed magical chain that binds them together. If you're playing alone, you can switch between them on the fly. The AI-controlled character isn't very useful in combat but fortunately doesn't take any damage either, so you don't need to worry about protecting your companion. And in most cases, the AI character does a fine job of following you around, but there are a few things, like ramps, that the character sometimes gets stuck on and seems incapable of handling, forcing you to switch back and forth to get both dragons into a position from which you can advance freely again. You're better off if you can convince a friend to join you. The ability to have a second player drop in or out of local co-op at any time is convenient, though it's too bad none of the versions offer support for online cooperative play.        On the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Dawn of the Dragon is gorgeous. From the picture-perfect vistas of green grass and rushing rivers under a pristine sky to the foreboding burned lands of the Dark Master Malefor, the vibrant colors and detailed environments create a compelling world that will appeal to younger players and older fantasy fans alike. As you'd expect, the Wii version isn't quite as impressive, but it's no slouch, though the less captivating visuals, combined with a few awkward motion controls, put it a bit behind the other versions. (Blocking is done by lifting the Nunchuk, for instance, and it's mildly distracting to have to always be mindful of how you're holding it so you don't accidentally stop attacking and start guarding.) In all versions, the camera can be frustrating. There are times when you can rotate it around you any way you please, but more often than not, you can only inch it a bit in one direction or the other, which is very limiting and prevents you from getting a good sense of your surroundings.     The excellent score, with its urgent, rousing choral sections and lush orchestrations, creates an emotional pull that, unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't warrant or support. As Spyro, Elijah Wood is a good fit, at least in part because of his familiarity as Frodo and the similarities between that unlikely hero's quest and this one's. Christina Ricci is fine but underused as Cynder; likewise for Gary Oldman as the wise Ignitus. As Malefor, Mark Hamill's voice is processed through so many filters to make it sound supernaturally booming and evil that they may as well have gotten Pee-Wee Herman to play the part for all the difference it makes. Wayne Brady, as Sparx, is forced to utter such painfully unfunny asides that you'll want to reach right into the screen and swat him yourself.     If you've already trudged your way through the first two Legend of Spyro games, you may want to play this one as well, just to see how it all ends. It will take most players around 10 hours to finish Dawn of the Dragon. But while you can sense the visuals and music straining to create a mood of epic fantasy excitement, it's just not enough. This game isn't good enough to redeem the series or to be a compelling stand-alone experience, so if you've avoided the previous entries, there's no need to jump in here.   "
4022,Virtua Striker 2,5.0,1,"Soccer, or ""football,"" as some would have it, is the world's most popular sport. That said, it's not unreasonable to assume that any time a soccer video game is released to the general public, it goes under the microscope as closely as one might critique a basketball game for accuracy and ""feel."" Very few of the myriad soccer games released have approached the upper echelon of what most people consider ""an excellent soccer game."" The games that have done so most recently have been titles like EA's FIFA, Konami's International Superstar Soccer, and Sega's World Wide Soccer. Interestingly, it is Sega that has created the Dreamcast's first soccer game, and surprisingly, it does not hail from the accurately detailed World Wide series. Instead, Sega's first ""footie"" title comes home from the arcade in the form of Virtua Striker 2. Virtua Striker 2 is as simple as a soccer game can get, and it's a soccer game that, against all reason, is incredibly popular in Japanese arcades. Practically as popular as Virtua Fighter and Virtual On in its country of origin, Virtua Striker has somehow managed to forge itself a devoted following, making this one of the more highly anticipated titles to come to the Dreamcast. While Sega would probably like to think of Virtua Striker 2 in the same breath as games like NFL Blitz or NBA Showtime, due to their extreme playability, this is absolutely not the case. Virtua Striker 2 was designed to provide a stadium-like sensation, along with all that implies. Not since Namco's Libero Grande have you ever had the sensation of being on the field as much as you do in VS 2. What's significant is that a game like this was only recently made possible due to the Dreamcast's powerful hardware. However, that doesn't save this game from being a clunker. The game is incredibly beautiful, but in the gameplay, where it counts, the game falls miserably short. To begin with, there is no analog control. While the arcade version featured the standard eight-way joystick, and not true analog, the Dreamcast version would have benefited from analog greatly due to the overly stiff control the D-pad provides. Secondly, never during a game do you feel as if you really have control over your players. This is partly due to the horrible auto-select feature the computer provides. What this means is that the computer selects which player you control, and the choice doesn't always make sense. Often, the computer automatically switches you to a player that's not even onscreen. Other times, while you're chasing a ball, another member of your team, coming from the opposite direction, will come within striking distance of the ball. The computer automatically switches your controller to this player, instantly switching the direction of your controller and taking away any sense of interaction with the player you might have tentatively had. It never gets better either. Goalie control? Bah! Good luck!Your other controls consist of short pass, long pass, slide kick, and offense realignment. While this sounds streamlined and dandy, it never seems to work to your benefit. The computer is agile and very adept at taking the ball from you every two seconds, something that, unfortunately, doesn't seem to work the other way around. Frustratingly, your only method of defense, aside from trying to steal the ball, is a slide-tackle. Despite the simplified interface, where throw-ins and goal kicks are handled via an onscreen button prompt, the game is anything but simple. One-touch kicks are nothing short of impossible to do because of the ""innovative"" power meter. The power meter functions like a swing-meter in a golf game. Instead of instant pass-shoot one-touch shots on goal, you must pause (even while running) to hold down the shoot button for an indeterminate amount of time before you can kick. Early experience will find you shooting far wide of the goal, often missing by a mile. There are many other jarring problems, including an almost total lack of voice commentary - the only vocal sample powerful enough to stick is the incredibly grating ""GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!!!"" that some loudmouth bellows every time someone scores. You're also stuck with one lousy camera angle that, while functional, gets boring quickly for people who like a top-down, or side-scrolling view in their soccer games. There's no FIFA license in case you were wondering. The list goes on and on, but the biggest crime this game commits is the complete and utter lack of playability. While there are loads of tournament, arcade, and versus modes available, they all play badly and are no fun, in equal proportions. Perhaps the biggest and most offensive omission is the lack of four-player gaming. Virtua Striker 2 only supports two-player action, which is incomprehensible, considering the four controller ports on the front of the Dreamcast.  Graphically, the game is wonderful to look at, if you like looking from one stinking camera angle the whole time. Character models, though, are built with oodles of polygons, giving them a nice hi-res, full-bodied look, which is impossible on the PlayStation or N64. Motion capture was put to good use here, as every player moves smoothly and fluidly, but again, this never carries over into the gameplay. When games like FIFA 99 almost completely get it right, with control a deliberate and conscientious thing, Virtua Striker's faults become obvious far too quickly. With Namco developing a soccer game (World Kicks) on Sega's Naomi board, and Konami whipping up an International Super Star Soccer for DC, there are far better possibilities for DC soccer playing looming on the horizon. Even without the third-party competition, it would even be difficult to recommend VS2 as a rental. A hi-res example of how not to design a soccer game, Virtua Striker 2 is a classic example of good ideas gone horribly wrong. Avoid at all costs."
868,Madden NFL 19,8.0,2,"The Madden series aims to be a true-to-life representation of the popular American sport, and Madden 19 is a refined step forward with advancements across the board. There are some issues hanging over from past games, and the Franchise updates are not as big and exciting as you might expect, but Madden 19, with its capable Frostbite engine and its compelling Longshot story mode, remains the best, most complete Madden game to date.On the field, Madden's gameplay has never looked or handled better, and this is due in part to a new system EA calls Real Player Motion. One of the biggest pieces of this is the new ""one-cut"" feature for ball-carriers that allows them to change direction quickly and with a burst of speed to get around a defender. An appropriately timed cut, coupled with an acceleration boost, lets you make tight, fast, and precise turns that help you get through the line or to the edge when making runs. You can also perform hesitation moves that can make a big difference in those crucial moments when you see an opening or a gap, and it's thrilling to successfully execute a run, even if it's only for marginal yardage. Establishing the run game can be critical, and it's nice to see Madden 19 make running responsive, fun, and representative of what you see in real NFL games.To balance out the new tactics for ball-carriers, Madden 19 adds a new strafe burst mechanic for defense. If timed appropriately, this can help you get into position faster than normal and improve your chances of stopping a big run. EA has always strived to give players more control and better responsiveness on the field, and the advancements this year are nice, even if they are only granular in nature. And in a further step towards emulating actual NFL games, Madden 19 lets you choose a custom celebration after a touchdown or a big defensive play with individual and team-based celebrations. Whether you're performing a simple spike on your own or doing the spoon-to-mouth dance with your team, it gives Madden a more authentic feel.This is the second year of Madden using EA's Frostbite engine, and it has indeed made strides to make the game look better. Character models are now more lifelike, while small things like player sweat (yes, really), the way bodies crunch and recoil after big hits, sunspots pouring onto the field at dusk, and weather elements like rain and snow get even closer to replicating an actual NFL broadcast. While the graphics looks better, the physics can still be really weird at times. I saw things like arms bending in ways they absolutely should not, mid-air collisions causing the ball to launch through the air at an angle and speed that makes no physical sense, and balls that disappear into the ground for no reason. Crowd animations can also be odd at times. The Madden franchise has always been replete with bugs and weirdness, and I tend to agree that this is part of the charm; none of the issues I encountered were enough to completely break the immersion. Also new in the presentation department are the menus, which now look sleeker and are less cluttered.Madden 19's commentating is a big bright spot. The play-by-play/color duo of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis return, and they have an excellent rapport. Their banter succeeds thanks to their football acumen, as well as their willingness and ability to emulate real NFL broadcast booths and shoot the breeze on topics like stadium food and Seinfeld references. While Gaudin and Davis turn in excellent performances, the Texas high school commentators from Longshot mode really steal the show with their over-the-top, homer play-by-play calls that left me laughing and wanting more. Another commentating update this year is former ESPN anchor Jonathan Coachman as the pre-game/halftime host; he replaces Larry Ridley. Coachman is enthusiastic and fun to listen to, but most Madden players are likely to skip these segments. Madden 19's commentary will be updated on a regular basis with new dialogue lines that reflect what happens in the real NFL once the season kicks off later this month, though it remains to be seen if the commentators will tackle controversial subjects.One of the deepest modes in Madden 19 is Franchise. Last year's game was frustratingly light on advancements and improvements, but the new Madden thankfully adds more to the mix to give you a different kind of control over shaping your franchise--and the individual players on your team. One of the more notable new features is what's called the Archetype Progression system which adds different styles to positions and lets you continue to build and expand your players over the course of one or multiple seasons. The XP you earn in games gives you skill points that you can then spend to upgrade one of the archetypes for your player instead of assigning them to specific attributes. This can feel frustrating as it effectively limits the amount of fine control you have to shape your players as specifically as you were able to previously. This might have been done to help balance teams in online play, but whatever the case, it's a bit of a bummer to have that kind of precise control taken away.Madden 19's new custom draft class creator for Franchise is another welcome addition. At launch, you'll be able to download draft classes made by the community, so you can expect some dedicated player to create the latest real-world NFL mock drafts in real time.Another way to play Madden is through the card-based Madden Ultimate Team mode, which remains Madden's deepest pursuit--and it's stocked with things to do this year. In addition to the standard challenges, of which there are more than 100, there are Solo Battles where you can go up against other fan-created MUT squads in weekly tournaments, while there will also be a playlist for MUT squads made by EA Sports developers, NFL players, and celebrities. It's a thrill to take on a different squad each playthrough in Solo Battles, and I can see myself returning again and again to this mode to see how my team stacks up. Already a deep and robust mode, MUT adds the brand-new MUT Squads Challenges, where you and two others take on the CPU in a series of football challenges. Provided your teammates know what they're doing this is a mode that delivers yet another compelling reason to play MUT online and keep coming back. Yet another online mode, MUT Champions, goes live on August 13.MUT still pushes you towards microtransactions, and that may be a concern for some. But it remains as exciting and satisfying as ever to put together a fantasy team where Tom Brady can throw a touchdown pass to Jerry Rice.Returning from Madden 18 is the Longshot mode, which was arguably the biggest, most impressive, and fleshed out new feature that the franchise had ever seen. It wasn't perfect, and neither is this year's version, Longshot: Homecoming. The story picks up with Devin Wade having a tough time in the Dallas Cowboys training camp, with Colt Cruise struggling through life in Mathis and getting blindsided by a major life event that puts his entire life and career into question. The voice acting and performances of all the major characters, Wade in particular, are solid. EA also recruited celebrities like frequent Adam Sandler collaborator Rob Schneider, Ron Cephas Jones (This Is Us), Jimmy Tatro (American Vandal), and Joey King (The Kissing Booth) for the mode, and they turn in memorable performances.Homecoming's story is one of pain and struggle, loss and redemption, and how football really doesn't matter when compared to issues at home and in life. Homecoming, like Longshot before it, has bold ambitions in terms of the story it tells and the feelings it wants to evoke, but it doesn't always work. At one point early in the story, Cruise remarks to a character about ""some of the most cliched stuff I've ever seen,"" and this could also apply to Homecoming's story. At times, it can be uneven and inconsistent in its tone, coming across as very hokey and ham-handed.And in what is a surprising move, EA (almost) completely dropped the Telltale-style dialogue options from the first iteration. It was fun to make choices and steer the conversation in the original Longshot, even if the story never really branched, so it's a real shame that EA moved away from this in favour of a more traditionally structured story. That being said, the narrative will pull you through and, at just about four hours in length, you may finish it in one sitting. Unfortunately, I experienced a significant difficulty spike at the end of Devin's story where he goes up against a much better team and has to make all the right plays to get the win. A lack of variety in this sequence and the upswing in difficulty made what should have been a climactic conclusion a boring and frustrating affair. Those issues aside, I had a fun time playing through Devin and Colt's story, which reached a satisfying and heart-warming end.Madden 19 is an excellent football game that improves on last year's entry in almost every way. There are problems, but there has never been a football game that more authentically represents the NFL than this in terms of presentation, controls, and depth."
4852,Sniper: Path of Vengeance,2.0,0,"A few weeks ago, Electronic Arts released Battlefield 1942, the successor to developer Digital Illusions' ambitious but deeply flawed game Codename: Eagle. Against the odds, Battlefield turned out to be a great popular and critical success, topping sales charts and winning GameSpot's PC Game of the Month for September 2002. Maybe it's a season of miracles, because Xicat has published Mirage Media's Sniper: Path of Vengeance, a first-person shooter that--improbably--is actually more awful than the developer's last game, the thoroughly wretched Mortyr.   Sniper has a lot of big-ticket problems such as bugs, poorly implemented gameplay elements, ridiculous and ridiculously profane dialogue, and terrible enemy AI. But let's start with a small detail that captures Sniper's pervasive atmosphere of clumsy amateurism. A few of the game's early levels take place during a prison riot. As you make your way through the prison, you'll notice that some of the corridor walls are conspicuously decorated with a large photo of what looks to be a member of the development team and his cute little toddler. Unlike in some games where pictures of the developers are hidden in images that are appropriate to the environment, it appears here as if somebody scanned a family photo, didn't alter it in any way, and then inexplicably made it a recurring theme of the bleak prison's visual design. This would be a great idea if Sniper had been developed as a foul-mouthed interactive Mother's Day card, but in a full-priced game targeted at consumers who aren't directly related to the staff of Mirage Media, it's just ridiculous.   The game's title pretty much sums up the plot: You're a sniper and you're out for revenge. This revenge is motivated by...something or other. But despite the game's title, the path to your vengeance doesn't include much in the way of actual sniping. You do get a sniper rifle, but for the most part you'll be using a traditional arsenal of machine guns, pistols, and grenades to blast your way through the army of henchmen standing between the entrance and exit of each level. In what might be an effort to make the game's title a little more relevant, enemies scream ""Sniper!"" even if you're firing at them with a shotgun from three feet away.   Graphically, architecturally, and thematically, Sniper's level design is merciless in its unrelenting blandness. From sewers to generic office buildings to barren streets, there's nothing in the environments that hasn't been done before and better. The most unique feature of Sniper's levels is that, for some reason, the game returns to the desktop for a few jarring seconds during each level transition. These transitions also occur at odd moments. You may be fighting a couple of enemies positioned at the end of a hall, take a step toward them, and unexpectedly trigger the next level, which magically transports you away from your opponents.   Powered by LithTech's Jupiter engine, Sniper's visuals are even less impressive when compared to the competition than were Mortyr's two years ago. In some ways, Sniper's visuals are specifically worse than Mortyr's. For instance, Sniper has none of Mortyr's occasionally effective reflective surfaces.   Mortyr's enemy AI primarily caused the game's characters to run right at you, wobble back and forth while firing, or ignore you altogether while jogging in tight circles. For Sniper, the programmers have retained the running-right-at-you and wobbling-back-and-forth behaviors but have fixed the jogging-in-circles problem. In its place, they've added the brand-new ability for enemies to stand around doing nothing, as well as a new bug that lets enemies walk right through closed doors. This door-related ghostliness combined with the way character models appear to move much, much faster than their legs are animating makes your opponents seem disconnected from the gameworld. And while doors generally present no obstacle for everyone else in the shadowy, sniperless world of Sniper, they're like Venus flytraps for you. Often, opening a door will cause you to become embedded in it, at which point you'll have to close the door and then reopen it to get unstuck.   Yet in spite of all its problems, Sniper is still a pretty good game. No, that's just a joke to lighten the mood a bit. Now, here are some other technical problems: About halfway through the game, firing the shotgun causes the screen to go black for a while. So shotgun fans who don't mind terrible games might still want to avoid Sniper. Sometimes when the game makes its brief, between-level detour back to the desktop, it just stays there without ever managing to load the next level. The sound cuts out if you fire a machine gun for too long. On the other hand, the game's frequently grating and bizarrely inappropriate soundtrack never shuts up. It even plays full blast during dialogue scenes, which at least saves you from having to hear the idiotic script.   No multiplayer mode is included in Sniper. Just in case Mirage Media decides to sneak one into a future patch, here's a preemptive review: It'll probably be bad.   Sniper is derivative, homely, tedious, and buggy. It also has a useless character stat and leveling system, so RPG enthusiasts can hate it too. In all fairness, the developers do deserve credit for one good design choice: Sniper's only about six hours long."
1339,Dangerous Golf,4.0,0,"Across four countries and numerous locales, you will hurtle golf balls into objects including fine dining ware, pianos, priceless works of art, and--why not--urinals. Don't worry about choosing an appropriate club or timing your swing just right. Simply aim the camera, press a button, and let the catharsis of destruction sink in. When you break enough items in a level, you can execute a follow-up Smashbreaker shot, which allows you to manually steer a bouncy, flaming wrecking ball, plowing through props and racking-up score multipliers until your timer runs out.Wrapping your head around the physics of a bouncing golf ball is easier said than done, especially when the game's camera is obscured by flying pieces of broken objects. Once your Smashbreaker shot is powered up, you have to use both the left stick and the camera to control the ball, as well as two shoulder buttons to dictate how high or low the ball bounces. Most of the time, you can sort of steer the ball the way you want to, but it usually feels like you're trying to steer a ship with broken equipment, praying it reacts the way you want it to and struggling to correct it when it doesn't.You eventually have to putt the ball into a hole, but if there's an unobstructed path (one devoid of unbreakable objects), you can just push forward on the analog stick and the ball will zip right in, smashing through smaller debris along the way. But if higher scores and rankings are what you seek, you may decide to bounce your ball off of walls or hit it into the air and attempt to drop it in the hole for an added bonus--sometimes you're left with no other option.There are rare levels filled with dozens of holes, where putting is your only objective. With a limited amount of balls in hand, you need make sure your shots are true--or at least pray they are lucky--in order to avoid running out while frantically taking aim at targets near and far. Pure putting levels lack the destruction found in standard outings, but they stand out as the best Dangerous Golf has to offer. In these moments, your goal is clear, and more importantly, your controls are intuitive.The oddball nature of Dangerous Golf is momentarily enjoyable, but apathy quickly sets in as you proceed to smash familiar objects level after level, resulting in all too familiar chaos. The game attempts to liven up your experience by introducing gimmicks like bombs, and showering you with loud graphics and sound effects. But all of this does very little to make the experience appealing in the long run. It's like a comedian who shouts mediocre jokes--being loud doesn't make the material any better.With 100 levels and far fewer unique locations, Dangerous Golf is best enjoyed in small bursts lest you grow bored of the repeated use of familiar maps. However, any amount of time in the game can prove frustrating due to the burden of long load times, especially when you get to the more complex missions. In later levels, you're still smashing objects like you always have, but you ultimately have to learn to avoid hazards and direct your ball on a particular path in order to hit specific objects to earn enough points for a medal. When precision fails, you will naturally restart the level.This process becomes unbearable--it seems the game is completely reloading the level--and you have to stare at the same loading screen every single time. To make matters worse, the loading screen is just an image of the controller with button descriptions. Buried in the corner are little hints--the only attempt the game makes to explain its nuanced scoring and control systems.Dangerous Golf is a game you want to love, but it becomes increasingly difficult as you go: the unintuitive controls stop being cute and begin to become an annoyance; the objects you smash, which for a moment inspired joy, become an afterthought. Wacky games have a place in gaming, but a game like Dangerous Golf needs more than boisterous effects and odd scenarios to sustain its allure."
2046,Earth Defense Force 2025,6.0,1,"When will the aliens learn? It doesn't matter how much more advanced their technology is than ours, or whether they attack us from the stars or from deep under the surface of our own planet. They can never hope to defeat us, because we have one weapon whose sheer might they can never overcome: the indomitable human spirit. As it turns out, though, all those assault rifles, rocket launchers, and other weapons we have lying around come in pretty handy, too. Like its predecessors, Earth Defense Force 2025 is a gleefully destructive romp in which you use powerful weaponry to kill aliens and to lay waste to city blocks, all in the name of saving humanity.  You start each mission by selecting one of four classes, then outfitting your chosen defender of Earth with weapons from the arsenal of firearms you've collected in earlier outings. If you're playing solo, the well-rounded ranger is usually the best choice, since the other three classes function better as support than as one-person armies. Air raiders can summon vehicles and handle the targeting of missiles, mortars, and the like, but don't have very effective weaponry for defending themselves in the frantic skirmishes that are so common in EDF. Fencers are the most heavily armored and can wield the heaviest weapons but lack the mobility of the other classes. By contrast, the mobility of the wing divers, who use their jetpacks to leap and soar about the city, makes them fun to control, but they're also the most vulnerable class. (Unlike the well-protected, all-male ranger, air raider, and fencer units, the all-female wing diver unit has to wear skimpy, revealing armor; that's the only way to make it light enough for them to fly in! It makes perfect sense!)   The appeal of EDF is increased significantly when you play with others, both because most classes function best in a supporting role and because there's so much more opportunity for unpredictable comedic mayhem when there are four of you than when there's just one. You might be minding your own business and gunning down some giant spiders when one of your comrades ""accidentally"" drives a tank right into a building and brings it crashing to the ground. Or you can work together, combining your destructive might to turn that row of buildings into rubble. After all, who's going to complain about a little collateral damage once you've saved humanity from extinction?  "
2086,Driftmoon,7.0,2,"      You approach combat armed either with a melee weapon combined with a shield, or with a bow you fire from a distance. The latter is best used against venomous enemies and mobile bombs, which chase you while declaring that they have a present for you. (Don't believe them!) In battle, you attack automatically when you aren't performing various special skills, and keep doing so until all enemies are dead or you manually break free from combat. Any followers you have attack on their own without requiring (or even allowing) any input from you. Unfortunately your allies aren't rowing with both oars in the water, and get hurt often. They won't die, but if they take enough damage they get temporarily knocked out, leaving your lone hero to finish the dirty work.   "
2772,Haunt (2012),8.0,2,"PaRappa the Rapper fame--has crafted a pleasantly spooky ride through a ghost-infested mansion, complete with a story that doesn't take itself seriously and mostly accurate motion controls that capture you walking, punching, dodging, and even covering your ears. In some ways, the game is kind of a Kinect highlight reel that shows the peripheral in its best light most of the time, despite a few moments when it doesn't track you quite as accurately as it should.        The story is a standard take on the old adventure trope about exploring a huge old house inhabited by the usual motley collection of phantasms. You visit a once-grand Victorian residence at the behest of a mutton-chopped gent named Benjy Muldoon, a wealthy eccentric that has somehow become trapped in his own artwork. Freedom comes at the cost of having you gather four vials called phantaflasks, which have the power to fire up a machine that will restore Benjy to his (rather fat and fleshy) corporeal form. Three of these artifacts are swiped by ghosts at the close of the opening tutorial and secreted away in three different wings of the mansion. Each comes with a theme, so in one wing, you deal with ghosts and traps centered on sound; in another, everything is about sight; and in the last, you have to take on movement-based threats. Expect about four or five hours of play. You can tackle these wings in any order you choose, although once you're in, you're in, and you cannot back out to try another one if you get stuck.     Gameplay rolls out as a traditional point-and-click adventure from a first-person perspective, only with real-life movements tracked by the Kinect replacing the pointing and clicking. Most of the time, this works surprisingly well. You use one hand to mimic the action of controlling a flashlight beam that rotates your point of view, and you walk in place to move through the house's darkened corridors while ghosts constantly jump out at you doing everything but shout ""Boo!"" Opening doors, chests, and dressers is handled with pulls and pushes. Combating ghosts and avoiding traps involve a lot of ducking, dodging to one side or the other, taking roundhouse swings, making sound attacks by screaming, and covering your ears or eyes to prevent damage.        There isn't anything here that is hard to beat, which makes the game particularly good for youngsters and those who value the pleasure of the experience over sheer challenge. It's all rather shallow, although at least the movements don't demand too much of either you or the Kinect. Every time you get gooned by a ghost, instructions pop up onscreen telling you to immediately make moves like ""Duck!"" and ""Dodge!"" There is a lot of repetition in the ghost battles as well, so things are a snap once you get into a groove.     Controls can be frustrating at times, however. They occasionally flake out, with the flashlight refusing to properly track your hand movements. You can get stuck on scenery, which forces restarts to get going again. This can lose you a lot of progress because the game only autosaves at the end of levels. Walking can be annoying as well. You have to practically goose-step to make sure that the Kinect tracks you properly. And quick movements during action sequences don't always register. If you duck or dodge too soon or emphasize the movement too much or too little, you wind up getting smacked by your spectral foes. There seems to be a sweet spot that can be hit most of the time, but not all of the time. Thankfully, the combat isn't very tough, and you are constantly rewarded with vitality boosts and vials that keep your health high.       Despite the use of the Kinect technology, Haunt feels like a game from ages past. There is an innocence here that you used to get with the likes of Atari's Haunted House or Sega's Ghost House. That pure sense of fun, plus the reasonable 800-point price, overcomes any issues with the occasionally wonky controls and makes this a must-buy for younger players, nostalgia buffs, and those who just want to try something a little different with their Kinects.  "
3340,TV Superstars,6.0,1,"you can be a star! Yes, you!--found in so many reality TV shows. This game could almost be a telling satire of the modern predicament, but sadly there is no irony behind the controller as you learn to correctly apply makeup, mix paint, stir ingredients, and shoot paintball guns in a series of reality TV-style showdowns. When it works properly, the gameplay is fun and engaging, but this enjoyment is often interrupted by the game's one-dimensional context and features that don't work as they should.        TV Superstars follows you, a celebrity wannabe, on your path from the Z-list to the A-list. Getting there involves completing a series of PlayStation Move minigame challenges on four different reality TV shows, focusing on fashion, cooking, home improvement, and combat sports. Completing the challenges earns you fame points, which contribute to an overall meter that determines your celebrity status. There is also an acting agency, which you must visit regularly in order to appear in TV commercials to further boost your status. Each of the four TV shows is broken down into a set of smaller episodes, with each one containing four or five minigame challenges. Once you earn enough points in these episodes, new ones will be unlocked. A glammed-up green room serves as your hub, from where you can make and customise your avatar, check your status, pick shows and challenges, and allow other players to join you. The first snag comes when you use the PlayStation Eye camera to take shots of three facial expressions--normal, happy, and angry--that will be mapped to your avatar. While the photos themselves turn out fine, the game's face-capture technology does a terrible job of mapping, resulting in a Frankenstein-like version of yourself that you must constantly look at as you play.      Because the content of the minigame challenges is tied to the individual shows, there's plenty of variety and engaging gameplay. The challenges are also a little more difficult than you'd expect from a game like this, which keeps things interesting and provides an incentive to keep playing: the higher your score in the challenges, the more fame points you get. Some of the challenges repeat depending on the show; for example, the cooking show challenges have you cooking increasingly complex dishes by following the onscreen prompts with the Move controller. These involve stirring, cutting, mixing, heating, pouring, and doing a ridiculous dance routine mid-challenge because the host of the show is really big on rap. The fashion show is made up of a series of episodes in different locales around the world, with each episode consisting of the same formula: a remember-this-outfit minigame, a how-to-apply-makeup minigame, and a catwalk challenge where the aim is to walk straight and then perform a series of hilariously awkward dance steps in front of a large crowd.    Gladiators and silly Japanese game shows. The challenges here involve a combination of carnival-style games and obstacle-course physical fitness challenges that tend to involve oversized gym equipment or some sort of paint cannon. Using the Move controller in different ways in each of these challenges is fun. The controller tracks well, and the response is immediate. The only time this is frustrating is with minigames that require attention to detail or accuracy, like tracing, painting, or drawing within a narrow area, which prove very difficult to get right and require prodigious skill (probably a breeze for art restoration specialists).        Though the context of TV reality shows makes good fodder for some entertaining minigames, the overall premise is a little too friendly with the perils and pitfalls of fame.  The feeble attempt at a linear story is nothing more than a series of slow-loading vignettes that show your progression from fame-seeking desperado to catty socialite. Situations where you must record a commercial by performing a series of consecutive moves with the controller (move left and right, look up and down, swing around!) to match your avatar's onscreen movement and endorse a particular product offer an interesting change of scene, but the wanton abandonment with which you associate your face with toilet bowl cleaner feels mildly cynical. This underscores the will-do-anything-for-fame attitude that pervades the game. The fashion reality show also revels in the same shallow endeavors of that field: putting on make-up, walking down the catwalk and swinging the Move controller in time with your hips, and stripping off to your underwear for numerous clothing changes. Again, the minigames can provide some lighthearted entertainment, but the celebration of vanity here is slightly offputting, particularly during the make-up minigames, which suffer from the aforementioned accuracy issues when required to paint colours within small areas on the screen, and often result in your avatar looking more like The Joker in The Dark Knight than a model.     It's only when playing with a friend (or three in this case, if you like) that these shortcomings become easier to ignore, at least for a while. You can play the game from the start with other players, taking turns to complete the minigame challenges and receiving individual fame points and celebrity status. Apart from being more fun, multiplayer also shifts the focus from trying to beat your own score all the time to a more social experience, where the sense of competition is real. You can also pause the game at any time and return to the green room to add more players.      TV Superstars is best enjoyed with a dose of perspective. Its attempt to capture the zeitgeist is, for the most part, done well. If the game had a less overbearing agenda, and worked properly where it was supposed to, it would be possible to completely overlook its cursory context and concentrate on the gameplay, which is reasonably enjoyable thanks to the variety of minigames designed to stretch the Move's capabilities.  "
957,Metal Gear Survive,5.0,1,"The game is set shortly after the attack on Mother Base in Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes. During this siege, a wormhole into a parallel world appears, sucking in a chunk of Mother Base, along with the members of Snake's Militaires Sans Frontières and the attacking XOF forces. Your character is sent by a U.N. scientist named Goodluck through the wormhole to Dite, a barren, drab-looking parallel world that's made up of recycled Metal Gear Solid V locales. There you're tasked with finding the cure to a parasite that has infected you, and also seek out what has become of your comrades. Survive's story is mostly uninteresting and plays out through text and voiceovers on static screens, similar to the iconic codec conversations of its forebears, minus any of the charm. Although it tries to bring in some of the political machinations and pseudoscience the series is famed for, each narrative beat is a thinly veiled excuse to repeatedly send the player out to retrieve memory boards for an AI companion, rescue survivors, or activate machinery. Despite some small hooks into the greater Metal Gear canon, the narrative is largely forgettable and keeps out of the way of the gameplay.The urgency of Metal Gear Survive's exploration and resource gathering routine is dictated by health, hunger, and thirst. While the first of those can easily be managed by avoiding damage from enemies, the other two are an ever present doomsday clock, constantly counting down to your demise. They are the proverbial gun to your head and, unfortunately, they diminish every other gameplay opportunity Survive offers.From the moment you land in Dite, you're on the back foot. Survive wants you to know that success in this hellscape will come through struggling and pushing forward in the face of overwhelming adversity. The food and water so key to staying alive are scarce, and even the act of seeking them out expends resources in a way that will make you pause and really think about whether it's all worth it. It's a grueling grind where the material rewards offer just a fleeting respite.And therein lies the problem: hunger and thirst deplete at such a rapid rate that micromanaging them becomes an all consuming task, particularly during the tedious first few hours of tutorials and story exposition. Their corrupting influence is pervasive, and because the economy of intake versus expenditure is weighted so heavily against you, the best course of action is often to limit engagement with the game's systems, be it exploration or combat.Take material gathering, for example. This is done by running around Dite in search of dilapidated buildings to pillage materials used for crafting and general upkeep. However, movement is constrained by the thirst meter and the knock on effect it has. Sprinting consumes stamina and, as you become more thirsty, the maximum amount of time you can sprint for lowers. It can be topped up by drinking water, but that's in short supply. In the end, jogging, while considerably slower, doesn't drain the stamina meter and thus won't need you to drink water as frequently.The result is that running around and exploring Dite is an arduous chore where you languidly run back and forth between your home base and an area of the map where you suspect there may be something useful. Movement is joyless, and it's compounded when you venture into Dust, an area of the map enveloped in a thick poisonous miasma.The greatest rewards can be found scattered around Dust, but simply being there adds more demands. While in Dust, an oxygen meter appears and begins counting down, effectively limiting how long you can be out there before needing to return to a safe zone. Although the game's in-game currency, Kuban, can be converted into oxygen from within Dust, you can only do this a few times before it becomes prohibitively expensive. Each time the cost increases, so at a certain point you're losing more Kuban than you're gaining from harvesting enemies or the naturally growing Kuban in Dust. Visibility is also significantly reduced and the map becomes inoperational for large stretches of time. Although there's always a distant light in the sky to serve a beacon to safe ground, uneven terrain and rocky outcroppings also obscure vision, so it's easy to get disorientated and lose track of your objective. Because of all this, your time in Dust becomes brief and your spoils often feel paltry, hardly worth burning precious resources for.By stacking the odds so heavily against you, successes--big or small--feel like an act of defianceIn your travels you'll inevitably encounter Wanderers, the game's main enemy force. These braindead creatures can't see very well but have a keen sense of hearing, so they'll investigate noises and attack if they sense you or any other source of sound nearby. But it's easy to find straggling Wanderers and pick them off by simply running behind them and using an instakill attack. Their movements are slow, their attacks telegraphed, and each one behaves exactly the same. If isolated, Wanderers provide no challenge and require no strategy to kill. Late in the game new enemy types are introduced, some which move quicker and pounce on you, others that will lob bombs from a distance, but they're more annoying than challenging.Metal Gear Survive's combat is lacking in dynamism. On a basic level, it's functional. The act of raising and swinging a weapon, be it a spear, axe, or sledgehammer, is slow and deliberate, inviting you to think about how long it takes to execute an attack and time it so it hits the enemy without leaving you open. Connect, and you're met with the satisfying thud of thick steel meeting hard muscle, or a sharp tip piercing the flesh or the protruding crystallized weak point of a Wanderer. Ranged weapons provide a little more speed and freedom of movement, while allowing you to pick off enemies from a relatively safe distance. Unlocking abilities can add new attacks for different melee weapons, but they don't significantly change the way you play. As a whole, combat is also the victim of Survive's underpinning systems. This time, however, it's the game's protracted crafting and upgrade systems.Both of these are reliant on Kuban energy, most readily sourced from Wanderers. A dead one will provide a small amount, while a downed one can be sucked through a mini wormhole and sent back to base for more, much like Metal Gear Solid V's Fulton Recovery mechanic. In order to actually craft new weapons and equipment, you also need to find the recipe for them, and these are usually in containers hidden around Dust. There isn't a way of locating containers outside of randomly stumbling upon them while exploring, and when you find them it's a crapshoot as to what you'll get. A light on the containers cuts through the thick fog in Dust, so you can spot one in the distance but this is also more likely to happen by chance. Were it possible to actually spend a decent amount of time exploring Dust, perhaps it'd be a little easier to stumble upon containers, but the thirst, hunger, and oxygen limitations prevent that from happening.If by some miracle you find the recipe for a new weapon, you'll need to have the relevant materials to craft them. Basic equipment such as spears, bows and arrows, and machetes can be crafted using wood, iron, copper, and other materials that are more readily available. The exciting stuff, however, is limited to rarer materials, which like everything else in the game, is hard to come by. If you really want, or need an item, your only option is to keep going back to Dust for short stints, aimlessly wandering around in hopes of finding what you need.Survive does make exploration a little easier using Wormhole Transporters, which serve as fast travel points in and out of Dust, as well as between each other. However, powering these up for the first time draws large groups of Wanderers to your location, at which point you must erect fortifications and fight off waves of enemies as they attempt to destroy your defenses and the teleporter. These moments are when Metal Gear Survive actually feels thrilling to play and, surprisingly, it's because of the limitations of the game's systems that they are.Setting up before the ambush, you're acutely aware of how little you have to work with and the fact that if you fail, you'll also lose the resources collected and progress made since your last trip to base camp. This means being diligent about setting up fences, barbed wire barricades, and sandbags in choke points so you can control the flow of Wanderers. It requires you to spend the time beforehand ensuring you have enough arrows, bullets, molotov cocktails, and whatever else you can bring to fight, as well as the food, water, and healing items needed to sustain you through the onslaught. Once you activate the transporter and the Wanderers swarm, moving between choke points taking out enemies is tense, partly because of how inelegant movement and attacking feel. You need to be measured and precise; to put yourself in the best spot and make each swing count, all the while keeping an eye on your vitals, ammunition, and the state of your weapons. It's a delicate balancing act in which the stress comes from knowing how much you're committing to the battle, and the tension of how much you stand to lose.Admittedly, there's an element of finding the good in something bad there, not to mention a fair bit of psychological manipulation. Perhaps it's Stockholm Syndrome at work, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that there is fulfillment to be gained from Metal Gear Survive's grind. Whether it's managing to hold off waves of Wanderers for main missions or collecting edible herbs, hunting animals for meat, or sourcing some dirty water to briefly stave off the thirst, each one provides a small nugget of satisfaction; the sweet release of endorphins that comes with completing an objective. And by stacking the odds so heavily against you, these successes--big or small--feel like an act of defiance. I'm the rat pushing a button for a food pellet, and sometimes that's the best you can ask for.Base building is also a big part of Metal Gear Survive's gameplay, and there's enjoyment in spending time and resources transforming your ramshackle base into one outfitted with water tanks, areas to grow vegetables and rear livestock, cooking stations, and crafting benches. Over time you'll rescue people stranded in Dust and bring them home, where they'll potter around doing tasks assigned to them such as tending to crops. Growing your base is perhaps the most rewarding part of Metal Gear Survive, but the game doesn't make it easy. It barely explains mechanics such as resource sharing and creating exploration teams, and aspects such as crafting and building involve navigating a litany of menus. The game lays it on thick with information, and doesn't make an effort to show you what's relevant and why. Still though, it can all be intuited with a little bit of experimentation, and once you've done that it's easy to fall into a comfortable routine of returning home, upgrading your character, running maintenance on your defenses, and collecting produce. If there's any comfort to be found in Metal Gear Survive, it's here.You can also play Survive in online multiplayer, during which you team up with friends in wave based survival missions. Since equipment and items are shared between campaign and multiplayer, playing online alleviates Survive's more overbearing stressers, as this mode is considerably more generous about doling out material rewards and bypasses the need to find recipes by giving you weapons to repair and use. Multiplayer is a salve for Metal Gear Survive's more egregious problems, but relying on a separate mode to make the campaign feel manageable feels like an obvious sign that the single-player experience isn't balanced properly. Since Survive is always connected, chances are most people will be in a position to play online, but for some people it's not their preference. Unfortunately, however, playing multiplayer to accrue resource and weapons to take back into campaign feels like the only real way to get some breathing room.For the most part, Metal Gear Survive feels oppressive, demanding, and obtuse, and needlessly so. It's a shame because there's actually a good survival game in there, but the pressures it places on you make uncovering and enjoying that unappealing. Over time the ability to manage thirst and hunger becomes slightly more manageable, especially if you play the multiplayer, but the lead up to that is debilitating. There's some satisfaction to be had if you persevere and savor the small victories, but you'll quickly find yourself thinking about if your time would be better spent playing something else."
3139,Moon Diver,6.0,1,"     Much like Strider, Moon Diver is an action-heavy 2D side-scroller in which you hack and slash your way through countless hordes of foes while scrambling up walls and hanging from ceilings. The considerable differences lie in the details. The emphasis here is on multiplayer combat and on leveling up the four different characters, each of which has his own characteristics, like increased attack power or magic regeneration. Gaining a level lets you place points in health, magic, or attack power at the end of every stage, and you can hotkey four of the many unlockable MoonSault combinations (that is, spells) you find along the way to your directional pad. If this sounds like a recipe for complex combat, it really isn't. Most battles require nothing more than mashing the attack button over and over and jumping out of the way of incoming attacks since there's no option to block (and even some jump combinations cause damage). That's not to say that Moon Diver isn't without a fair dose of strategy, but it's primarily centered on choosing the best time to use your offensive and defensive spells.     And that's where the problems start to creep in. Even though you can theoretically play Moon Diver as a single-player game, it's all but impossible to get through the higher levels without some help from other players and their cache of spells. Not only are you subjected to arenas that throw dozens of enemies at you at once, but you also have to contend with an alarming array of pivoting lasers that can cut down even a high-level character in a fraction of a second. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if it weren't for Moon Diver's old-school progression mechanics, which boot you back to the main menu or the beginning of the game's otherwise agreeably long levels if you die. It's frustrating enough in the early phases, but it's outright maddening when you're slogging through the seemingly endless final level (which includes the final boss along with reappearances from former ones). You can mitigate the damage by bringing a wise selection of spells or grinding out several levels by replaying the early stages, but the lasers alone render Moon Diver a single-player experience to be reckoned with.

4431,Atari Anniversary Edition,4.0,0,"As the video game industry matures, the market for older game content is steadily growing--people who grew up with pioneering arcade games such as Defender, Xevious, and Missile Command are usually easy targets for retro-game collections. Infogrames, the current owner of the Atari name and catalog, has put together a collection of classic Atari arcade games, seasoning it with archive materials including interviews and photographs. The collection, handled by the perennial retro-compilation developers at Digital Eclipse, definitely contains some classic games, but limitations imposed by the low resolution of TV sets and the DC's controller make this package a great idea that is executed rather poorly.   At 12 games total, Atari Anniversary Edition contains more games than your average collection. The package contains Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Crystal Castles, Gravitar, Millipede, Missile Command, Pong, Super Breakout, Tempest, and Warlords. An aftermarket level-replacement add-on for Tempest, called Tempest Tubes, is also included. It would have been nice to see some other game variants, such as the rare version of Battlezone that Atari produced for military training purposes, included in the pack, but sadly, such is not the case. Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, and Battlezone originally used strictly digital control, and they all control just fine in the compilation. The rest of the games originally utilized some sort of analog control scheme, and they don't fare quite so well. Centipede, Crystal Castles, Millipede, and Missile Command all relied on trackballs for precise analog control, something the DC's analog stick fails to accurately duplicate. Crystal Castles suffers the most here, as you can't move poor Bentley Bear around fast enough to avoid the wicked trees and gem eaters in the game's higher stages. Warlords and Tempest used paddle-style spinners, originally. Tempest works well enough without any analog support whatsoever, but your paddle in Warlords moves around the outside edge of your castle in a very choppy manner, making it slightly more difficult to block incoming fireballs.   Graphically, the game tosses in a lot of extras, such as full-on cabinet artwork and background images that make the game look more like the original arcade machines. However, you'll usually want to turn these extras off so you can have more screen area devoted to the actual game. All the vector games look absolutely horrible when crammed on to your relatively low-res television. The sharp lines of a vector monitor come out horribly jagged on a TV, so much so that the copyright info at the bottom of Asteroids is almost totally unreadable. The sound is also hit-and-miss. Most games sound reasonably similar to their arcade counterparts, though some--Crystal Castles, for example--sound like they were recorded by holding a microphone up to an arcade machine's speaker rather than emulating the sound hardware properly. The high-score music in Battlezone also sounds pretty weird.   If you're looking for these 12 games, your best bet is, of course, to hunt down the original arcade machines. However, if you don't have an empty garage or a pile of money to spare, the PC version of this package does a far better job of emulating these classic Atari hits."
4544,B-17 Gunner: Air War Over Germany,4.0,0," 	B-17 Gunner: Air War Over Europe is essentially an arcade shooter in which you take the role of a gunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber as it flies bombing missions over Europe in World War II. There is no flight simulation aspect to the game: You simply man the guns and shoot down enemy fighters. Each mission begins with your squadron already in the air, and the mission ends before you land. It's really just a shoot-'em-up game that gives you targets to shoot at but restricts your movement.   Gameplay in B-17 Gunner is exceedingly straightforward. Six positions in the B-17 are modeled: nose gun, top turret, ball turret, right and left waist guns, and tail guns. You can jump between gunnery positions by hitting the number keys, and each gives you an appropriate view as you're looking out of the aircraft. Your job is to man these guns and protect your plane from enemy fighters. As your squadron loses escort planes, the enemy comes to focus increasingly on you. German fighters come in waves, and the deeper your mission into Germany, the more fighters you face per wave (although the length of the missions doesn't appear to measurably increase). At the beginning of the mission, you're shown a picture of your target. When you approach it, you are automatically shifted to the bombsight view and must center and release the bombs on the target you were shown in the mission briefing. At the end of each mission, you obtain a score based on successful bombing and defense of your aircraft. The goal is to live through 25 missions and be sent home. An indicator at the lower right of the screen shows your position in the plane. When gun positions get ""knocked out,"" they become inaccessible.   While you're in control of all your gun positions at the start of the mission, you won't find them all equally useful in practice. Some guns have very limited deflection (for example, at the nose and waist positions), and the persistent cloud layer really limits the effectiveness of the ball turret. Because the intercom sounds are mostly just oft repeated, canned phrases, it's often hard to determine where enemy attacks are coming from without constantly jumping from one control position to another. Instead of having other gunners call out locations (""Bandits at three o'clock low!""), they usually simply repeat a limited set of phrases, like ""Jeez, they're all over the place."" Consequently, it's usually better to simply sit in the top turret (which has the most freedom of fire) for the entire mission. Since enemy planes tend to attack from high positions, this is the most effective defensive strategy. Unfortunately, it gets fairly boring. Because guns reset their positions when you switch to a new station, flipping quickly between the waist and ball turret, for example, doesn't work because when you switch back into the ball turret, you'll find yourself facing aft (even if you were facing port when you left), and you'll have to waste time rotating the guns. Sticking to the top turret is the way to go.   The missions are essentially all the same, no matter what your target is or how deep it is inside Germany. Bombing is simply a case of squeezing the trigger while the crosshairs are over the target. While crewmembers will call out damage to the aircraft, this doesn't appear to affect its performance in any way. The aircraft is shot down only when all the gun positions have been eliminated.   As if this weren't enough, the game has fundamental technical problems that make it very frustrating to play. Despite the lack of detailed graphics and absence of any need for a flight model, B-17 Gunner stutters worse than some detailed flight sims that tax the computer far more than this simple arcade game. Even with a full installation, the game jerks, stalls, and stutters to such an extent that the graphics engine becomes a bigger obstacle to shooting down enemy planes than the planes' evasive actions. This stuttering persisted on two test systems that more than met the minimum hardware requirements, even after full hard-drive defragmentation and reinstallation. Considering the limited appeal of the gameplay in the first place, this is a crippling flaw.   Despite its simplicity, B-17 Gunner could have been an enjoyable, if mindless, arcade romp that you'd fire up for 20 minutes here and there to shoot down some planes and bomb some targets. Unfortunately, B-17 Gunner's numerous problems make it a product with little value, even at its reduced retail cost of $20.      	  "
847,Valkyria Chronicles 4,8.0,2,"You're deposited straight into the hot-seat of the Second Europan War as a Federation soldier, Claude Wallace, with your rag-tag bunch of friends including an adorable dog and a number of potential anime love interests. Unsurprisingly, your enemies are the Imperial Alliance, who all sport quasi-Germanic or Russian names and have an overwhelmingly burgundy color scheme for their uniforms. Any real world resemblances here are likely intentional; this is a fictional take on a world war that we've all read about in some way, shape or form in our own history books. Valkyria Chronicles has always drawn from a hodge-podge of WWI and WWII to create its own canon, and that mix is more pronounced than ever here. The timeline broadly overlaps with that of the first Valkyria Chronicles game, so be prepared to notice mentions of conflicts that series veterans will already be more than familiar with.The similarities between the two games are much more substantial than that, however. Valkyria Chronicles 4 is alike in almost every single way to the original except in name. The series continues to stay true to its blend of classic artistic European landscapes; there's rolling hills, snowy mountains, and vast bodies of water. The gameplay is still a unique take on traditional strategy RPGs which does away with the grid movement system of stalwarts like Fire Emblem, instead preferring to rely on a mix of turn-based tactics and real-time movement and fighting, creating ample room for reactive play and tense skirmishes. You deploy your troops in advantageous positions, move them until their action points are depleted, and fire at the enemy--it's a satisfying cycle.Valkyria Chronicles 4 also hones in on the way that the war affects a core group of childhood friends and former innocents, simultaneously decrying violence whilst also thrusting you headfirst into situations where it's unavoidable. It's in those moments, where you're backed into a corner with nowhere to go but through faceless enemy ranks, that the senselessness of the conflict really stands out, and those are some of the game's strongest moments.Accordingly, making sure that you have a squad that will be able to survive those skirmishes is key to your enjoyment of Valkyria Chronicles 4. You'll take command of a whole host of different soldiers throughout your journey, and each of them is special in their own way. Whether it's a brash Shocktrooper who gets an attack buff when he's around the ladies, or a timid Sniper who can't quite shoot straight when she's alone, each person that you deliver orders to is unique in some way. Soldiers have a chance of activating Potentials based on those personality quirks, which are buffs or debuffs affecting anything from unit accuracy to how terrified they are in the heat of the moment. This leads to plenty of friendly chatter on the battlefield that adds depth to your interactions with troops; in the absence of a formal social link system, these moments feel honest and raw when set against their backdrop of percussive gunfire and chaos.Chaos is really the name of the game when it comes to the broader military campaign, and your first few fights will probably feel that way until you get used to how the game's battle system handles. Valkyria Chronicle 4's first few hours serve as a lengthy tutorial, and you'll still be learning things even after you're multiple chapters into the main story. Troops work the way you'd expect them to--snipers, anti-tank units, and grenadiers do what they say on the tin, and there will be almost no surprises to those who have played similar Japanese-flavored military titles before. Mechanics are built around things like cover, return fire, and ammo management, and balancing all of those are key to victory. There are some improvements from the original Valkyria Chronicles, primarily in troop variety and quality-of-life niceties, but it isn't a significant overhaul. Getting accustomed to the way the quirks of your soldiers work in battle is the primary challenge of the game, and figuring out just how you can push the combat system to its limits is another. Those who know the system will find it easy to create overpowered combinations of troops, which can trivialize the early to mid-game experience to a point, if you can be clever enough.The overarching chaos also comes from the enemy's single-minded pursuit of the Federation's destruction, and you'll meet this beast at every turn possible. The Alliance is both an immediate, militaristic threat and an ideological one that overshadows every encounter and every non-combat interlude. It's not just a matter of turning the tide on the SPRG field and winning. The narrative drives you into increasingly hostile and inhospitable situations with odds that appear ever tipped in the Alliance's favor.You don't have the luxury of picking which battles to fight, and loading into a battle with flames as high as a barn licking at your troops and screaming coming through the static whirr of your communications device is confronting each and every time. On Nintendo Switch, HD rumble is employed smartly with vibration patterns changing depending on the type of weapon used, and sounding off both on impact and when you fire. Immersion can be affected somewhat by small issues with hitboxes, pathing, and line of sight displaying oddly in cramped conditions, but these instances don't really detract from the weighty atmosphere that the game works hard to perpetuate.Valkyria Chronicles 4 really excels in those sobering moments where it makes tough choices and leaves you to pick up the pieces. You feel like a cog in the Federation war machine because you are merely a cog in the war machine, and the story does a good job of hashing out age-old debates around ethics in wartime, necessary sacrifices, and whether or not there are truly any victors. That being said, the day to day operations of the game doesn't always carry the same big-picture weight, and the pacing is stronger for it. Much of your active time will be spent embroiled in a military conflict of some kind; your superiors point your squad in the direction of something that needs killing, and you do it. Some may see this as a lack of opportunity for true role-playing, but the absence of freedom of choice is arguably necessary in a game where the military hierarchy is a key component of the history that it seeks to reinterpret.Ultimately, this is a return to form for the Valkyria Chronicles series as a whole. It stays so true to the franchise's first iteration that it'll feel as if almost no time has passed in the decade or so since the original game first came out. In revisiting the concerns and the environments of the first, it makes the most of those parallels and invites comparison in a way that highlights its strengths. Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't necessarily tell a new tale, but it doesn't have to; for all of its clichés and expected twists, there's a charm to the game's unwillingness to let up as it drives you and your friends forward at a rapid clip towards its bittersweet end."
678,My Friend Pedro,7.0,2,"You play as an unnamed, masked protagonist who is accompanied on his violent journey by Pedro, a talking banana who acts as both narrator and instructor throughout the game. It’s clear early on that there’s something a bit off about Pedro, and while there are some eventual ""reveals"" to contend with, he’s mostly there to lend the game a sense of weirdness and to offer hints and tips as you go. There's a thin plot, but it's easily ignored--the only really important information is that you need to run through each level killing all the enemies, and if you kill every enemy quickly without dying, you'll get a higher score. There's a score multiplier that allows you to chain kills for more points, and trying to compete for a solid spot on the leaderboards is a good incentive to replay earlier levels on more challenging difficulties.As you chain together kills through the game's 40 levels, you have opportunities to shoot enemies while going down zip lines, riding on top of rolling barrels, jumping through windows, skateboarding, and bouncing off of walls. You can activate your focus at any moment to line up your shots and time your bullet-dodging spins perfectly. If you have two guns equipped, you can aim them independently, letting you dive right into the middle of a group of enemies with twin uzis blaring in different directions.Shooting your enemies is a joy, for the most part, but the combat isn't without its faults. The game's default auto-aim assist locks you onto the nearest enemy or potential target if you’re pointing your aiming reticule in their direction, which can sometimes make it more difficult to pull off the stunt you’d envisioned. If an enemy is standing in front of an explosive canister, for instance, aiming past them for that gratifying explosion is difficult because your gun sight won’t pull away from them. Thankfully, you can turn auto-aim down to almost nothing, which gives you more freedom at the cost of making the game a bit more challenging overall.My Friend Pedro suffers a bit from a lack of enemy variety, and while the style of goon you're facing changes over time--you fight assassins in the second set of levels, then professional gamers not long after--the main difference is that some of them have more health than others. There are some slight variations, but most enemies can be taken down in the exact same way: by pointing and shooting, with or without theatrics. Your enemies will shoot back with increasingly powerful guns, and while you can feel untouchable when you’re diving into a room in slow motion, they put up enough of a fight, even on ""Normal"" difficulty, that you need to be careful.Every now and then you might have to deal with a sentry gun or a minefield, too, but the game is at its best when you’re proving your superiority to organic enemies. Those slow-motion dives into hails of enemy bullets that visibly crawl through the air towards you are obviously inspired by The Matrix, and My Friend Pedro gets closer to capturing the feel of that film's shootouts than many of the myriad games that have paid homage to it. There are also a few boss levels to contend with, which are brief diversions that make some attempt to mix things up, but even these peak with the first one. The game runs through most of its ideas for creative ways to kill people pretty quickly, and while that sense of wonder never quite dries up, its truly great moments become more spaced out in the second half.In later stages, the game features numerous platforming sections as a way of keeping things fresh. They're never complicated enough to require you to really think them through, and several of them suffer from the game's finicky controls. While the movement controls are fine for combat, they're often hard to contend with when you're trying to traverse tricky terrain. When you're asked to roll and jump and slide down ropes with great precision, as you sometimes are, the game stumbles, as the controls don’t lend themselves well to exact platforming. This only really becomes a major problem right near the end, as the final few levels get extra demanding.The level designs also grow uglier as you go, too--when Pedro explains that you're fighting gamers in the sewers because video games tend to feature sewer levels, it's funny, but not funny enough to justify the drab aesthetics that the sewers display. That's not to say that these levels are devoid of joy--a late mechanic that gives some enemies shields that need to be deactivated adds some nice strategic depth and most levels serve up at least one or two sections where you can pull off some cool moves--but overall they're not as free-wheeling and enjoyable as the game is in its early stages.There's some padding, and the game suffers whenever there aren't enemies on screen. It's also, oddly enough, less entertaining when you start to get access to more powerful weapons--the late addition of a sniper rifle feels fundamentally at odds with the game's up-close-and-personal action, and while the assault rifle you unlock in the game's second half is powerful and fun to fire, it’s a shame they didn’t go a step further with its wildness and let you dual-wield the best guns for maximum carnage. My Friend Pedro is greatest when you're close enough to the bad guys to warrant continual cost-benefit analyses of running up and kicking them to death, but sometimes the best way to progress is to take out your enemies from a distance by pointing and shooting without much flair.But then you get to leap through a window on a skateboard, jump and spin through the air in slow-motion, firing uzis at two enemies at once; when you kick an explosive canister around a corner and pop out to shoot it just before it hits an enemy in the face; or when you jump between two walls, spring out of a gap, and take out two guys with a shotgun before they even know you're there. My Friend Pedro might pepper its later stages with fewer exciting moments, but the moments that make the game fun never fully go away. As soon as I finished the game, I restarted at a higher difficulty, keen to test my improved skills on harder enemies.There are sections in My Friend Pedro that are as satisfying and thrilling as you could hope for in a game like this, where it nails the feeling of being an impossible video game hero who can perform the unimaginable with great style and flair. There's a lot of appeal in replaying your favorite stages over and over, trying to move up the leaderboard. It isn't consistently exhilarating throughout the entire campaign, but My Friend Pedro is worth playing because it’s full of moments where you can jump down a shaft and shoot in two directions in slow motion, or kill an enemy by kicking the skateboard you’re riding into their face, or take out a room full of bad guys with the help of a frying pan. When it dedicates itself to letting you be inventive and weird with how you rack up your kills, My Friend Pedro is wildly enjoyable."
4264,Hot Wired,4.0,0," Bereft of the options and depth that turn a quick thrill into a long-term proposition, Xicat Interactive's arcade racing game Hot Wired would probably make a great game demo. Unfortunately, this temporarily enjoyable yet incredibly shallow work is not a demo at all. It is instead the completed final retail product, and as such simply doesn't deliver nearly enough intrigue or complexity even for its budget-conscious $19.99 price point.   Conceptually, Hot Wired sounds interesting enough. According to Xicat, players are asked to steal cars ""from all over the United States"" and thus become ""the greatest car thief of all time."" Yet in practice, the Hot Wired experience is far less interesting. That the actual act of thievery--a potentially exhilarating undertaking for any joystick-pushing car crook--is completely disregarded in the game is just one in a long list of problems and frustrations found in Hot Wired.   The Hot Wired formula is dead simple. You speed along predetermined chunks of roadway while sadistic police cruisers do their best to smash and crash you car into a stationary hunk of metal. Make it to the finish line of a given zone without being totally crunched and you'll unlock the next zone, and so on. The game supplies 10 such sub-five-minute raceways, each supposedly situated in and around major North American urban sprawls such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Yet the sad truth of the matter is that all 10 are virtually interchangeable.   First and foremost, the game consistently unfolds under the cover of darkness. This is night driving all the way, with the only visual indications of a world outside the designated stretches of pavement being the occasional spotlighting effect and a series of silhouettes on the distant horizon. In fact, the game is so frightfully dark that you'll be hard-pressed to remember where you are or even perceive such immediate roadside hazards as raised meridians or traffic barriers until you're almost upon them. Moreover, each environment seems nearly identical to all the others. Certainly the game's roller coaster road structure, demolition derby approach, and varying track lengths do spice things up a bit, but there is little doubt you'll encounter many of the same twists and turns in Portland or New York as you'd find in any other area.  Nevertheless, once a raceway has been chosen, it's time to ""steal"" a car. Initially, you'll have two from which to choose, each an imaginary and very modernistic beast that looks and behaves suspiciously like a Lamborghini or Ferrari. As the game progresses, you'll be offered five more vehicles, including a cop car, an Austin Mini look-alike, and a five-ton truck. Curiously, all but the truck, which is built to take a pounding without succumbing, are vastly inferior to the two you are handed at the beginning of the game.   It's in this car-selection process where the concept of car theft begins to break down. In fact, the program itself seems unclear as to whether your cars are stolen or purchased. Simply, you're presented with a paycheck at the end of each successful mission, which you'll then use to buy another vehicle. You'll then take that vehicle out for a spin and try to accumulate enough money to buy another vehicle. If you're unsuccessful with the new car on the new and more difficult track--which is made more difficult solely by the presence of even more police cruisers--there's nothing to stop you from going back to an easier track, then repeating the process over and over again until you own all the cars. Whether you really need to see all the circuits after you've driven the first half dozen or so is determined by how much repetition you can handle. As Hot Wired has no career mode, you will have experienced all there is to experience within the first several hours. The act of stealing a car or even the implied act of stealing a car never really enters into it.   On the road, the game is horribly uneven. Humungous semitrailers scoot along as nimbly as $200,000 sports cars. The vehicle physics model, which at best is evocative of the very first Need for Speed game, loses any sense of grip and logical reaction whenever it loses traction. Car and object clipping becomes almost unbearable at times, and the camera goes through all manner of visual gymnastics at just the slightest hint of contact. Off the track, Hot Wired is almost ridiculously simplistic. Joystick button assignments are permanently fixed, the level of difficulty is preset, and graphics are adjustable to just one of three universal settings--low, medium, and high. Multiplayer Hot Wire is not permitted, nor are garage modifications or repairs.   Budget games are a great idea, but not at the expense of quality craftsmanship. Although Hot Wired does offer a tolerable arcade racing experience, a bushel of camera perspectives, and a bizarre yet amusing car damage model, it is woefully short of options, undersized, and not nearly up to the expectations it sets up. For a similar concept and price yet a superior experience, racers on a budget would do well to check the bargain bins for past versions of Electronic Arts' Need for Speed series and leave this one for those who don't know any better.    	  "
3002,Section 8: Prejudice,8.0,2,"Section 8 to create an expansive and intense adventure that offers a lot more content than you would expect from a PlayStation Network game. A full-fledged single-player campaign is the biggest addition to the franchise, and it provides enough challenge and variety to lure even seasoned veterans into the fold. The competitive multiplayer hasn't seen as much improvement, but there's no denying the fun of gunning down a feeble trooper while you're stomping around in an oversized mech. Prejudice doesn't offer any significant additions to the genre and lacks the narrative punch to invest you in this universe, but it rises above small quibbles to offer a consistently enjoyable experience no matter which mode you play.         There is a story that revolves around the inherent prejudice space marines have to deal with, but its underdeveloped characters make it difficult to care about the high-stakes events. It's the gameplay in Prejudice that's worth caring about. On the surface, Prejudice looks like a cheap Halo knockoff. The bulky armor your fellow soldiers wear gives off a serious Master Chief vibe, and the rock-formation paths that make up most of the single- and multiplayer levels look like they could have been created in a Forge editor. But once that aesthetic familiarity wears off, you're treated to a shooter that has its own identity. You have a rocket pack with a limited fuel supply strapped to your back at all times, and smartly using this in both your offensive rushes and defensive scrambles adds a tactical layer to the run-and-gun proceedings. To counter your soaring opponents, you can lock on to them with a click of a button, but this ability can be used only periodically. Because your most powerful tools have to be used sparingly, you are forced to carefully think about your plan of action rather than rush in willy-nilly. It's a nice balance that makes it feel as if you're making strides with every hour you sink in.     Which weapons you use requires just as much thought. There are seven types available, ranging from long-range sniper rifles to explosive rocket launchers, and you can carry only two at a time. This is a fairly standard way to distribute weapons, but Prejudice makes things a bit more interesting. You choose what types of bullets you want to use as well and equipping yourself wisely can mean the difference between life and death. For instance, crash rounds are great against vehicles whereas slugs dish out high armor damage. There are also tools you need to concern yourself with. These include a repair wrench (for vehicles, structures, and fellow soldiers), grenades, and a knife. Melee attacks aren't standard in Prejudice. If you decide to equip something other than your knife, you can't attack with a close-range swipe, so you need to make sure you plan your line of attack before you enter battle. With so many different strategies, you need to play a few hours to wrap your head around how all of your weapons work together, and you even unlock more ammo types as you get deeper into the game.        It's a shame the controls can't quite live up to the vast array of abilities you have to play around with. That's not to say that it's difficult to move or shoot, but it's not nearly as smooth as the best games in the genre. This is immediately apparent when you first try to fire at a moving enemy. Your reticle is sluggish by default, and even when you tweak the sensitivity, it still doesn't glide as smoothly as you'd like. In battle, this means the difference between killing your foe in 20 shots rather than 10, and that can be frustrating in a heated fight. The lock-on feature helps alleviate this slightly, but you can't rely on that crutch all the time. The tank and mech feel much better than they did in the first Section 8, but they often put you at a competitive disadvantage. These monstrous machines get stuck on geological formations too easily, and because the camera zooms out to a third-person perspective when you're piloting them, your perspective is sometimes obscured by buildings, enemies, and natural landmarks. On the other hand, the hovercraft is a blast to pilot and quite powerful, which instantly makes it the most formidable vehicle in your fleet.      You have plenty of time to come to grips with your vast supply of weapons and vehicles in the lengthy single-player campaign. Unlike the original Section 8, which simply reused the multiplayer maps, this is a from-scratch adventure that does a fine job of mixing up your objectives to keep things fresh. In one section, you may have to storm a battlefield occupied by an evil force. Turrets and missile launchers track your every movement, sniper riflemen keep you on your toes, and grenadiers ensure you don't stay in one spot. Surviving an encounter with entrenched enemies intent on seeing you dead is an exhilarating rush, and because there are so many different ways to attack, you're free to use whatever strategy you deem best. At another time, you may be the occupying force trying to hold back an invading army, and it's just as much fun when the roles are reversed. You plant turrets where you want and call in supply terminals so you can reequip yourself on the fly, and you can even order up a mech suit if you feel like making people quake.       Prejudice doesn't limit itself to wide-open battlefields either. Certain sections force you to fight in narrow confines, and though this lacks the freedom of the large-scale battles, it's a welcome change in pacing nonetheless. It's in these sections that the difficulty ramps up, forcing you to rely on your raw killing ability to stay alive. Enemies are fast and relentless in Prejudice, and if you fall asleep for a second, you could find yourself surrounded by a group of rocket-toting toughs. The challenge is usually welcome, but there are a few sections that border on frustrating. Like you, enemies are sometimes equipped with a healing wrench, and when you have to take on a battalion of healers at once, it can definitely try your patience. They have a knack for repeatedly healing their friends whenever you chip away at their shields, and this cycle can be tricky to triumph against, especially when your own allies are hanging well back of the action. These odd difficulty spikes appear only a couple of times throughout the adventure, but they can halt your progress in a hurry.         Once you fight your way through the roughly 7-hour single-player campaign, it's time to turn your sights to the multiplayer endeavors. In Conquest, two teams (up to 32 players, with bots filling in vacant spots) try to earn 1,000 points first. You do this by capturing control points, killing enemies, and completing mini objectives. These side objectives are what turn this from a ho-hum game of ""capture the outpost"" into a volatile game of tug-of-war. Dynamic Combat Missions (DCMs) crop up in the middle of battles and shift your focus to impromptu events. These include missions such as protecting (or killing) a VIP, collecting intelligence from the other team's base, and securing a jammer. You earn big points for completing (or thwarting) one of these goals, so you need to keep your eyes on the HUD to know what needs to be done and where. These missions are entirely optional, so if you'd rather protect your home base or just kill your foes, you're free to do so, or you can run around healing everything that limps if that's your bag. There are tons of ways to be a productive member of your team, and it's a lot of fun to mix up your tactics and lend a hand wherever it's needed.     There are two additional modes in Prejudice that present a more focused experience than what Conquest offers. Assault pits two teams against each other in a quest to grab control points, with each squad alternating between offense and defense. Time is of the essence, so careful planning and smooth execution are paramount to success. Skirmish mode shifts your sights away from the control points. Here, you earn victory points the old-fashioned way--by killing. Dynamic Combat Missions return from Conquest mode, so you can help your team in other ways than just gunning down fools. These streamlined modes are less intimidating to jump into than the full-blown Conquest mode, but their narrow focus takes away some of the frantic appeal of their big brother. In the Xbox 360 and PC versions of Section 8: Prejudice, these were gradually unlocked after the main games were released. But for PlayStation 3 owners, these are available from the get-go.         New in Prejudice is Swarm. This is a cooperative mode that pits four friends against a never-ending horde of enemy attackers. You have to protect your base at all costs, and you have free rein to plant turrets and call in vehicles to help you hold back the flood. Swarm isn't nearly as exciting as the ever-changing Conquest mode, but it does add a bit more variety to this already expansive package. Organizing your tactic with a group of friends can be a lot of fun, especially when you get a couple of people patrolling around the outside of your base with hovercycles while the other two fire rocket blasts from above. Unfortunately, there are only a few different maps in Swarm, so the enjoyment is short-lived. You can bump up the difficulty level once you master the terrain, but it's not quite enough to give this mode legs. However, it's a worthy addition to the franchise and a good chance to team up with some pals to tear down a computer-controlled army.      There isn't much that Prejudice doesn't do well. Just about every element of Section 8 has been improved in some way, resulting in a refined shooter that never fails to entertain. Even though the core mechanics are solid and the weapons are varied, Prejudice lacks the creative spark that could have made this something special. The expansive campaign does a fine job of mixing up your objective types, but it doesn't do anything you haven't seen before. It's fun while it lasts, but you'll be hard pressed to remember anything specific that occurred when the ending credits roll. And the competitive offering is guilty of the same problem. Prejudice won't change the way you play shooters, but it's still a really enjoyable game, and at $14.99, it's a great value.      "
3507,Singularity,8.0,2,"     The fictitious Russian island Katorga-12 is at the center of all this campy fun. As modern-day soldier Nate Renko, you're sent to this mysterious place to investigate the radiation that emanates from it. As it turns out, the Soviets had been working with a powerful substance called Element 99 (or E99) back in the 1950s--but it seems the experiments weren't entirely successful. The Russians were toying with time, and after a dramatic crash-landing, you're caught up in a kooky time-traveling melodrama worthy of broadcast on the Syfy Channel. You end up flopping back and forth between 2010 and 1955, but the specifics aren't important: what matters is that you gain use of a fantastic gizmo called the Time Manipulation Device, or TMD. With this appliance affixed to your left arm, you gain all sorts of fantastical time-manipulation powers. Drop a giant bubble that slows down everything caught within it. Age enemy soldiers until they turn into dust. Restore a collapsed staircase to its original state by turning back the clock. Your brain might turn to mush if you think too hard about the specifics, but you aren't meant to take the plot seriously. Instead, let the constant supply of ambling mutated freaks and skittering bugs pull you along for the ride.       The TMD has limited uses when you first discover it, but as you earn new powers (and upgrade them at stations you encounter along the way), you grow to appreciate the way it keeps the action fresh and satisfying. Different powers affect enemies in different ways. Dropping your temporal sphere will freeze human enemies in its radius, but will only slow some of the more hideous creatures or cause them to ""phase"" in to your time period--that is, to stay visible so you can shoot them. Some beasts will toss exploding barrels at you, but you can catch them and throw them back, just as you can with rockets lobbed in your direction. You can even turn your human foes into creatures to help keep the pressure off. Some of the fancier weaponry also turns up the craziness quotient. Using one rifle, you can steer your bullet directly into your target in slow motion, which results in a satisfying splash of blood. With the sniper rifle, you can use a similar slow-mo effect to chain shots together. You're shuffled through set-piece sequences punctuated by the occasional mild fright, always needing to switch between weapons and use all of these newfound abilities. It's this variety that elevates Singularity above every other run-of-the-mill shooter.         Singularity further mixes up the pace with puzzles and exploratory interludes. The puzzles aren't too taxing, but there's a certain cleverness to some of them, such as one in which you must roll a grenade through a hole in the wall toward a group of mutants feeding on their prey. You also scour nooks and crannies looking for E99 and other objects you use to upgrade your weapons and TMD. Thankfully, the dismal dinginess of outdoor environments and the glowing organic pods lining the corridors keep the scavenging interesting and keep the buzz of tension alive. Yet while the art style gives this alternate history a distinct sense of time (or times?) and place, Singularity is not a looker. It uses the Unreal 3 graphics engine, but low-resolution textures, flat lighting, and occasional animation glitches make the game look somewhat behind the times. Animation stutters aren't the only oddities we encountered, either. Movement controls stopped responding at one point, forcing a reload; a non-player character failed to open a door at another point, which again required us to restart from the most recent checkpoint.         Singularity isn't a groundbreaking shooter, but it's an incredibly fun one. This is an example of how fluid pacing and a tongue-in-cheek attitude can make old conventions exciting again. Disappointing visuals and a smattering of minor flaws keep this first-person shooter from feeling completely modern, but not every game must probe the human soul to achieve greatness. Singularity achieves it with variety, moving you from one enjoyable sequence to the next without lingering too long on any given moment. Besides, this is a game in which you can both snipe hardened Soviet soldiers in bullet time and heal your teammates by puking on them. And is there any greater selling point?    "
2806,Trine 2,8.0,2,"   Fantasia or from the pages of a particularly lovely storybook. Deep, richly detailed levels pop with lively, luminous color. The forest is home to luscious glowing foliage and glistening colossal snails. Gloomier levels house oversized spiders, animated with skin-crawling authenticity. One level, taking in sunset on a tropical beach, is stop-and-stare beautiful.       Each hero has a simple, distinct set of powers. The knight has a sword and shield for fighting, as well as a warhammer for smashing obstacles; the thief has a grappling hook, along with a bow and arrow; and the wizard can levitate items and summon boxes or planks from thin air. In single-player mode, only one hero appears onscreen, but you can instantly flip between them to access the powers demanded by the task at hand.      The wizard's conjuring powers make him the best suited for solving a puzzle on your own. Though the basic platforming is smooth and accessible, with combat that is brisk and straightforward, the heart of the action is physics-based puzzling. At its simplest, this means constructing a ramp from crates, while more complex challenges have you reroute steam jets by hovering segments of pipe into place. In others, you channel water onto the roots of plants that shoot up, magic beanstalk-like, to create leafy new platforms on which to hop. New elements such as movable portals, waterwheels, and lava streams come thick and fast, in addition to memorable one-offs, such as a house-sized frog that lassoes giant fruit with its tongue.        Though many of the puzzles suggest single, efficient solutions right off the bat, some of the best fun is to be had experimenting with the physics and looking for less-obvious solutions. Trine 2's physics engine is robust and fine tuned, and noodling about with it is engrossing in its own right. The game is generously rigged to allow for the guilty pleasure of fudging a solution when the elegant answer is out of reach; teetering structures of magic planks can be used to bypass clever gate mechanisms altogether or the same planks can be jammed gracelessly into the gears.      Trine 2 prefers to keep you moving briskly along to holding you up with a real brainteaser. There's even an optional hint system that kicks in after a few minutes of head scratching. It amounts to a friendly game but not an overly easy one; there are much trickier secrets to be found and collectable experience orbs in hard-to-reach spots, with the latter feeding into a simple set of talent trees. For instance, as you level up, the thief can upgrade to fire or ice arrows, the knight can upgrade to a charging shield bash, and the wizard can learn to materialize more boxes at once.      In local multiplayer, or in the online multiplayer that's new to this sequel, your two co-op companions play the other two characters. This lets you combine powers rather than flit between them, although hero swapping on the fly is also permitted. Combining powers opens up new avenues of sandbox tinkering; the wizard can float other party members on a conjured plank platform or hang a goblin harmlessly in midair for the thief to skewer with arrows. For maximum sandbox tomfoolery, there's also an unlimited mode, in which any combination of hero characters is allowed.        The storybook-style narration is genteel, and the heroes are amiably voiced. The music is rousing, too. Here, as with story and setting, Trine 2 cleaves comfortably to the genre, with all of the cheery piping of a high-class Renaissance fair. If you bypass secrets and ignore experience orbs, you can breeze through a single-player campaign in six hours or so. Although Trine 2 wouldn't outstay its welcome at twice that length, it's no raw deal, given the modest pricing ($15 or £12). This Trine follow-up is a more complete, refined work than its predecessor, and those who didn't catch the original are in for a real treat.   "
2056,Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII,5.0,1," Final Fantasy XIII, and now, the heroine of Lightning Returns. And she's right. In her newest adventure, Lightning is not interesting in and of herself, but because of what she means to others, and what others mean to her. To Bhunivelze--that is, God--she is the means of readying humanity for the new world soon to be born. To old friend Fang, she is the key to retrieving an artifact that holds untold power. As for Lightning, the only force driving her is her love for her dead-but-not-really sister Serah, and the possibility that they may be reunited--but even that possibility doesn't stir Lightning's emotions. Indeed, Lightning is a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices, but little more. To be fair, Lightning's stoicism is a story point in Lightning Returns, yet it's this same stoicism that makes it nigh impossible to connect with her; she has but one personal motivation, and is defined solely by that motivation. In fact, every character in Lightning Returns is defined by the most basic of traits, all of which serve the needs of the plot, rather than the plot flowing from the needs of the characters. How amazing, then, that these characters never stop talking, finding new ways to explain the simple events occurring around them with as many words as possible. For having so little to say, the characters of Lightning Returns sure do talk a lot. You could say the same things about many other Japanese role-playing games, as well as plenty of anime and manga, but I can't remember the last time I played a game with so much dialogue that went absolutely nowhere. The stage for all of these histrionics is the world of Nova Chrysalia--or, more accurately, four fairly large regions of Nova Chrysalia that you traverse over and over again as you perform the tasks required of you. The world is soon to end, and Lightning is the key to God's plan for a new beginning. She is the savior, the one who will rescue as many souls as possible in order to guide them to the new world, and Serah is God's bargaining chip. In turn, returning character Hope Estheim acts as Lightning's guide in his ark, a base that exists outside of time's flow, and houses Yggdrasil, the famed tree of life that has become a JRPG mainstay. Lightning Returns is not a game about Lightning, but about events that unfold with such melodrama and visual panache that you can't help but gawk at the beautiful spectacle before you. Some of these events have some semblance of sense, while others (such as the arc that explains the ever-annoying Chocolina's backstory) are absurd fluff, but the ""whoa"" moments come and go with some degree of reliability, making you wish that they were part of a sophisticated narrative in addition to being sensory delights. In my favorite of the game's many cutscenes, Lightning dons a gorgeous mauve gown and takes center stage in a theatrical production that make a Cirque du Soleil show look like a flea circus. The music swoons, fireworks and other vibrant flourishes fill the screen, and for a moment, the pageantry sweeps you away in an exuberant gust of sound and light. Lightning is a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices, but little more. Final Fantasy XIII-2 have roles to play, but their stories are typically self-contained, culminating in final speeches that might represent 180-degree turns of the emotional positions they held just moments before. At least some of the actors deliver their lines with enough gusto to make you believe in their proclaimed passions. Final Fantasy XIII-2's misunderstood villain Caius Ballad has the most stage presence among them, thanks to actor Liam O'Brien's resonant baritone, though even Vanille finds redemption now that she no longer must bear the burden of an entire world (rather literally, at that). Elsewhere, Lightning Returns embraces the usual monosyllabic coos and shrill vocal deliveries that characterize Final Fantasy, though this isn't a matter of acting choices, but rather of inconsistent voice direction. Sadly, the mediocre audio production is a major distraction. You explore and reexplore the game's four zones as Lightning, who usually travels alone, with Hope chattering in your ear via transponder so frequently, you wish he'd just shut up. He drones on so often, in fact, that he's constantly cut off mid-sentence whenever a battle suddenly occurs, when you trigger a cutscene by walking into a new area, or when you engage another character in order to complete quests. In the most extreme examples, Hope cuts off his own dialogue, though even when he isn't the one providing his own interruptions, lines are constantly shut down mid-sentence, sometimes to be repeated, and sometimes to be forgotten. The game drowns you with unnecessary audio, as if developer Square Enix were fearful that you'd forget what you were doing or why you were doing it. You might think you could simply wait for dialogue to finish before venturing forward or engaging other characters, and in theory, you can. However, Lightning Returns is designed to make you hurry. You see, the world is going to end whether you like it or not, and the clock is always ticking. The game adheres to a strict timetable, automatically returning you to the ark at 6 a.m. every day. To see Lightning Returns to its finale, you need to add several more days to the calendar by saving the right souls--which in turn means completing story quests. Stopping to listen to entire lines of dialogue uses up precious minutes, so when faced with the decision to do nothing while you listen to Hope ramble or to move on and risk interrupting his exposition, you move on. The countdown is anti-story. The music swoons, fireworks and other vibrant flourishes fill the screen, and for a moment, the pageantry sweeps you away in an exuberant gust of sound and light. Not only does the time management mechanic collide with the overzealous audio, but it collides with almost every other aspect of the game. I suspect that like me, many people will discover just how frustrating the flow of time is when they reach the world's end before they have progressed far enough to have saved its populace. In this circumstance, the game abruptly concludes, and then invites you to start over again with all of your spells, weapons, and so forth intact--a New Game Plus. The moment came as a slap in the face after 33 hours of playing on medium difficulty, and the slaps continued as I played through a second time, during which I could so clearly see all of Lightning Returns' attempts to pad the gameplay and waste my time. You can mitigate the frustrations by playing on easy, but doing so bandages the wounds without addressing the disease. How does Lightning Returns waste your time? It does it in how it handles exploration. As you complete certain side quests, others may open up, but you may not know where and when they do so, or even if they will. In that sense, the game invites you to return to regions again and again, seeking out new activities. But the clock is always working against you, and the time you spend exploring previously visited areas may not yield any fruit, making the entire journey a pointless one; even traveling to other regions by train uses up additional time. In that sense, the game punishes exploration by pushing you ever closer to imminent Armageddon. The countdown is anti-exploration.   How else does Lightning Returns waste your time? It does it by forcing you to lose an in-game hour whenever you escape from battle, but not effectively communicating if you have the right tools for major enemies beforehand. You might be well equipped for the creatures in the vicinity, only to discover that you are not powerful enough for the boss that concludes your quest, or the miniboss that stands between you and the next phase of your journey. The combat system itself encourages you to try different approaches, but the clock punishes you for doing so. The countdown is anti-experimentation. That combat has plenty of bright spots, however, and were it not for some execution issues, it may have even found a place among Final Fantasy's better battle systems. The paradigm mechanics of the previous games have been reimagined, and Lightning is the only character you directly control. At the heart of battle--and indeed, at the heart of character progression and customization--are combat templates called schemata. Schemata, in turn, are attached to the outfits Lightning wears. She can wear up to three at any time and switch between them at will during battle. Not only do various outfits have their own attributes, but so do the weapons, attacks, and accessories you can equip to them. As you earn new spoils in battle, visit vendors, and complete quests, your options grow, and schemata customization becomes more and more compelling. I enjoyed fine-tuning each schema, giving them descriptive names and maximizing various qualities with ornate shields and impossibly large katanas. On the battlefield, additional strategic elements come into better focus. For instance, each schema has its own maximum health, but when you take damage in one schema, that damage is reflected in other schemata by the percentage of health you lost, rather than in the actual amount of damage. As a result, it's best to have the schema with the most health points equipped when the enemy lands its blows. In addition, certain costumes have a particular attack hardcoded into them; in other cases, equipping a given item or casting a particular debuff may change the nature of certain attacks. The inherent freedom of schemata makes them deeply appealing. The game punishes exploration by pushing you ever closer to imminent Armageddon. Once combat begins, however, you must face Lightning Returns' vexing blocking mechanic. Each attack you unleash costs a certain number of ATB (active time battle) points, and the ATB meter replenishes more slowly than you use it up. As a result, you must switch between schemata frequently--a strategic consideration similar to the one paradigms introduced in the other XIII games. It's the newfound emphasis on staggering that leads to the greatest aggravation on the battlefield. Staggering an enemy typically (but not always) makes it temporarily impotent in battle, and allows you to deliver a lot of damage without opposition. You can stagger enemies by bombarding them with the spells and slashes they are particularly vulnerable to, but precisely blocking their attacks is even more effective. And if you want to avoid grave injuries, it's sometimes a requirement. The most obvious problem with blocking is that Lightning Returns, like its predecessors, values visual pageantry over precision. That was fine in the previous XIII games, which required little exactness, but when the camera is swaying about, framing the fluid animations, brilliant explosions, and fearsome monsters, it's rarely giving you a consistent view of your surroundings. You can click a thumbstick to watch from a better vantage point, but even then, the game's insistence on forcing beauty on you comes at the expense of granting you a proper perspective. Avoiding damage can require split-second timing, but you can't block attacks you can't see. And remember: while you can escape battle, it costs you time, though Lightning Returns does give you some methods to ward off the pain of lost hours, such as the limited skill to slow time to a crawl for a short while and prove yourself a one-woman army. Nevertheless, the foes you face while pursuing story quests prove a roadblock the first time through, forcing you to pursue other opportunities and hope that making various citizens' dreams come true will help extend the clock. You might suppose that grinding for levels would boost your battle effectiveness, but Lightning doesn't gain levels, and there is no experience to gather. Instead, completing quests, whether they be story quests, side quests, or tasks offered from Chocolina's minor mission board, rewards you with additional health, additional strength, or other perks, such as an increase in the number of recovery items you can possess. Pursuing Chocolina's tasks is much the same as level grinding, only instead of fighting to earn experience, you are fighting to reap objects that you can turn in for a small boost to your attributes. Most missions are of the usual ""fetch"" or ""kill"" variety, and have you crisscrossing the desert, weaving through forests, and roaming city streets. Menial tasks like checking the time on a dozen clocks or growing greens to feed to your chocobo mount aren't absorbing on their own, but they do get you out into the world, where you can complete assignments in any order you choose. And while treading across the same sand dunes and winding paths grows tiring, there are countless details to admire. When I first encountered a trio of miniature moogles roving the woods, chirpily greeting each other and announcing it was their bedtime, I was utterly delighted. I shuddered when I looked closely at a beastly gorgonopsid's razor-sharp teeth, before vanquishing it with a shimmering bolt of frost. And Lightning herself dons meticulously tailored outfits, with every button polished to a shine, each pair of boots carefully constructed, and each fabric impeccably embroidered. Those details carry over into garb like the amazon warrior outfit, which covers only the minimum amount of skin, and features a panty line so low that Lightning looks like an extra from a hypersexual Onechanbara game. These outfits speak to the game's tonal inconsistencies; Lightning's costumes have always been body-conscious, but they've never been overtly provocative, and the sudden spotlight on Lightning's ladybits run contrary to her aloofness and professed desire to avoid the limelight. If you'd rather giggle than ogle, you can always equip Lightning with an adornment, like a bushy goatee or a feline tail, and then change her clothing colors to a garish puce-and-pea-green combo. Lightning doesn't smile, so you can't laugh with her--but at least you can laugh at her. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask leaps immediately to mind. Yet Majora's Mask handled its time limits with care, whereas Lightning Returns layers them on top of mechanics that don't support them. This supposedly final chapter of Nova Chrysalia's story leaves me befuddled. It's a collection of ideas and concepts that don't come together in a coherent way, led by a character who has shown no identifiable growth since her first appearance four years ago. The promising schemata system and grandiose cutscenes are solid pillars from which a great RPG could have been constructed, but Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII falls well short of greatness."
3259,BioShock 2,8.0,2,"BioShock 2. At a reasonable 800 Microsoft points ($10), Minerva's Den is a must-play for those who have lost themselves in the carefully crafted underwater dystopia known as Rapture. The deliberate ebb and flow of BioShock 2 is encapsulated wonderfully in this moody excursion into previously unexplored areas, all of which provide a tense backdrop to the exciting conflicts that occur. While BioShock 2: Minerva's Den starts off at a sluggish and familiar pace, it eventually builds to an exceptional, tender payoff that stays with you long after you've emerged from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean.         When you first start Minerva's Den, it strikes a familiar chord. You're a Big Daddy, known as Subject Sigma; the voice of an unseen supporter serves as your guide through Rapture. That voice belongs to Charles Porter, who struggles with his nemesis, Reed Wahl, for control of Rapture's overseeing AI, known as the Thinker. It's a setup you've seen in the series before: Porter's disembodied voice leads you from one objective to the next, helping you discover story-centric plasmids, guiding you through new areas, and eventually leading you to your final destination. The narrative's appeal lies not with its structure, but with its personal nature. Reed is not a very compelling villain, but Porter is a personable, even-tempered escort, and the audio recordings featuring his musings are the best of the lot. He ponders subjects such as racism and the relationship between man and machine, and diaries featuring his beloved wife are heavy with emotion. The ending is an eye-opener, surprising from a plot perspective and thematically consistent with prior BioShock revelations. The poignant coda that follows provides a thoughtful end to a story arc that starts predictably, only to blossom into something truly special.      These events occur during those of BioShock 2, so you encounter many of the same enemies, weapons, and plasmids seen in the main game. There are additions, however, such as the ever-so-helpful ion laser, which streams energy continuously into your victim. The pacing is great, and even more intense than you might remember--a condensing of BioShock 2's alternating segments of atmospheric exploration and high-adrenaline battles versus Big Daddies and Little Sisters. ADAM-harboring corpses are placed in smart locations that are tight enough to make protecting your Little Sister a rush, yet surrounded by enough doorways and choke points to reward you for carefully setting up rivet traps and mini turrets. Coming face-to-face with a Big Sister is still terrifying, due in part to the screeching sound effects and shrieking music that accompany their appearance. Even standard enemies are fun to fight, however. New foes include brutes that glow with fire and throw debris at you; splicers covered with a layer of frost; and ominous new Big Daddies that can blind you with the cannons they wield. And should one of those teleporting Houdini splicers dog you, use the new gravity well plasmid and watch it twist in the air, limbs flailing like a scarecrow caught in a cyclone.         There's a certain been-there, done-that vibe to your progression, but the excellent atmosphere helps fend off the overfamiliarity. When you enter an industrial zone, the wafting smoke and deep red lighting make you feel the heat. In another area, you get a chill when you encounter frozen bodies and falling ice crystals. A brief journey into the oceanic depths provides quiet respite that is then broken up by the fun battle that follows. The atmosphere, story, and intensity of battle culminate with a hectic confrontation that has multiple strong foes coming at you from multiple angles, and gives you a chance to use the plasmids you collect and the weapons you upgrade. Here you see BioShock 2's level design at its best: claustrophobic, yet with just enough room to maneuver around your plodding foes. This keeps tension levels high, without ever causing frustration because there isn't enough space to move or flank.      Minerva's Den plays host to a few of BioShock 2's infrequent irritations. You commonly have a buzzing security drone or two at your side, but annoyingly, they still tend to flit out of range when you try to repair them. The typical BioShock texture pop-in might occasionally distract you as well, considering how much time you spend looking closely at various objects and environmental details. But these quirks are forgivable in this heartfelt epilogue to a creepy and philosophical underwater saga. The BioShock franchise has explored sociopolitical themes few games dare to consider. BioShock 2: Minerva's Den infuses these themes with warmth and humanity, making you share in Porter's nostalgia for a vision of Rapture that never was.    "
1640,Ziggurat,7.0,2," You will face many challenges as you leap and sprint through the labyrinthine ziggurat. It features procedural level design, which means you get a different adventure every time you play. Like The Binding of Isaac, levels are constructed of a series of linked rooms, and the doors slam shut in the presence of dark minions, sealing you in with your prey…or your hunters. Lurking in the dark passageways you find the usual smattering of fantasy archetypes, such as necromancers, sword-wielding skeletons, and impish goblins--along with some exceptions, such as evil mushrooms and crab-clawed demons. Oh, and killer carrots. Yes, carrots, which are almost too adorable to put back into the ground--but what else are you to do against vegetables that turn evil? Some rooms contain traps you must overcome, or modifiers that change how you approach a fight. The latter can include increasing enemy size or quadrupling damage given and received; you can also get something more aesthetic, such as the always-amusing big pixel mode, which gives the game the look of a mid-90s shooter. Every quest into the ziggurat's recesses has a humble beginning. At first, you are armed with only a simple wand and a slowly regenerating mana pool. But your arsenal steadily increases to include three other magical tools and powers, including spells of ice and poison and staffs that rapidly fire glowing bolts of energy. Weapons and spells are scattered throughout the ziggurat's many rooms and floors, either floating in the air or stored in chests, just waiting to get plucked and added to your hotbar. Each come equipped with an alternate attack that changes their attack speed or potency at a higher cost to your mana pool, which is replenished by picking up colored gems that fallen enemies occasionally drop. It won't be long until you find your favorite tools of the mystical trade. The magma rifle, with its incredible range and powerful explosive slug, is always a top choice. But the one I will always make a mad dash for is the scarab beetle staff, which fires red bugs that ricochet off surfaces. The staff works wonders at medium range, but in smaller rooms, those carrots don’t stand a chance! Ziggurat is a fight for survival against some nasty foes, but the longer you persevere, the more chances you have at increasing your odds of survival. Gathering knowledge gems that are periodically dropped by your fallen enemies allows you to level up and choose one of several random perks, which come in the form of magical cards. Perks can also be acquired in secret rooms, their hiding places betrayed by cracks in the wall. An element of strategy is involved in picking the right perk, and your decision can have a huge effect on how long you last against the oppressive odds--in Ziggurat, you will find that long-term planning can lead to handsome rewards. Favoring the perk that instantly replenishes any lost health seems like a no-brainer. But you have a choice between said card and Bookworm, which allows you to choose among three cards on the next level instead of the default two, how would you proceed? You can also gamble with your fate in rooms where shrines to ancient deities rest. Sacrificing health or mana give you a chance to earn a divine favor if you're fortuitous or a penalty if you’re not. If you stumble upon the Oracle perk, which removes all divine punishments, fortune will smile upon you.   Movement and combat flow at a rapid pace, reminiscent of classic shooters of yore. There is no stamina to speak of, so sprinting from room to room goes unabated. It's actually quite common to fly through an entire floor in under 10 minutes. You're not slowed down by pools of water, and you can fall from precarious heights without taking any damage. You can adjust your position in the air as well, which is necessary for some of the challenge rooms. These rooms award you with a new perk, spell, or weapon after you dodge flying darts or nimbly hop across rocks and floating debris in stretching pools of lava. This degree of energetic locomotion keeps your heart pounding as you explore the ziggurat, often running backwards, Serious-Sam style, from approaching clutches of hungry foes, picking them off with shotgun blasts of arcane ice or blowing them apart with chemical bombs. Ziggurat's sweat-inducing velocity, combined with the satisfying feeling of growth brought about by its perks system, is, well, spellbinding, and it had me returning to its musty halls even late into the night. But some issues will pull you out of the enchantment. There are graphical glitches and performance issues, such as frame rate drops and flickering shadows. In its defense, however, Ziggurat looks fantastic. The game dazzles with a charming, almost Fable-like quality, with sources of light emanating from burning torches or esoteric crystals sprouting from the floor to cast bright hues of purple, yellow, and green against grungy stone walls and floors. So it's a shame that on rare occasions, black smears damage Ziggurat's attractiveness. These smudges flicker as you look around, and they can be thin and amorphous, stretching across the screen. The worst smear I encountered covered a good third of the upper portion of my view. And let me tell you, when you have hulking foes to fight and projectiles to dodge, missing such a huge chunk of the screen is unacceptable. The blotches, oddly, only exist in a single room at random, and they seem to be triggered by minions. I couldn't make any sense of this phenomenon, which haunted several of my playthroughs.   Beyond that, I just can't seem to find any love toward Ziggurat's bosses, who guard the portal you use to ascend to the next floor. Some of the bosses are merely larger versions of existing enemies, but none of them, except the final boss, offer much of a fight. Most go down after a minute or two of circle strafing, while you only have to dodge the occasional flying projectile. Ziggurat can be completed in just over an hour, but it's unlikely you will stop there. The game is challenging, engaging, and a whole lot of fun, despite its problems. There is an abundance of perks to discover and up to 11 characters to unlock, all of whom have a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. If you believe you have the mystical skills to conquer the mighty Ziggurat, now is your chance to prove your worth."
941,Batman: The Enemy Within - The Telltale Series,9.0,2,"Telltale's Batman: The Enemy Within convincingly presented me with the idea that I could find salvation for the Joker. That I could use the Dark Knight's unwavering sense of justice as a guiding hand, hopefully to shape him into something other than the maniacal Clown Prince of Crime. I was wrong, and I failed.In the end, events played out as they always do: A cackling clown and a man dressed as a bat standing on different sides of the law. This is a disappointing bait and switch, but only because I let myself think things could be different--I saw hope where there was none. The fact that I bought into the idea speaks to the strength of the writing and performances throughout the series. Despite this letdown, Episode 5 remains a compelling end to a story in which Batman becomes a participant in the creation his greatest adversary.While that's not a unique concept, 'Same Stitch' takes the idea that Joker exists because of Batman and explores it more directly. Where comics allow subtlety and subtext to suggest the symbiotic nature between the two characters, Telltale's take is more overt, and makes a stronger, clearer statement because of it: Maybe Batman is the reason villains exist in Gotham, and maybe his crusade is doing as much harm as it is good.In possession of a deadly virus and being hunted by an out-of-control Amanda Waller, John Doe comes out of hiding as a vigilante calling himself Joker. That's the person I shaped though my actions as Batman. Wherever possible, I put my faith in him, trusted him to do the right thing, and gave him the benefit of the doubt, hoping it would have a positive impact. In response Doe modeled himself after Batman, complete with Jokerangs, a grapnel gun with chattering teeth, and the overwhelming compulsion to see justice served.But, despite my intentions, I had unwittingly placed Joker on the path to realising his villainous destiny, albeit with a short detour through vigilantism. The episode begins with Batman trying to recover the deadly virus in Doe's possession and stop him from doing harm. Amanda Waller, meanwhile, wants to capture Doe and Batman, and resorts to using villains to get the job done, putting together a Suicide Squad of sorts.Events quickly spiral out of control. Having been blamed for killing The Riddler, Joker becomes focused on proving that Waller is the real villain in Gotham. His morality becomes black and white, and Telltale does a great job of forcing Batman to admit there are shades of grey. As Waller argues her case, it's hard not agree with her that Batman has taken similar measures in his crusade. This showing of sympathy, and Batman's insistence that she face trial instead of suffering a more immediate fate frustrates Joker, making him lash out.[Joker's] morality becomes black and white, and Telltale does a great job of forcing Batman to admit there are shades of greyBatman's rigid code of conduct and unwavering morality erodes Joker's sense of what it means to be a hero and conflicts with his need for reparations. The result is is a mentally unstable figure that acts on violent impulses and lives by a twisted sense of self-serving principles. Instead of dropping John Doe into a vat of green chemicals to create Joker, Episode 5 presents your influence as Batman to be one of the reasons Joker is born.Same Stitch manages to be introspective and thoughtful, while also providing plenty of levity. Joker's stint as Batman's sidekick is incredibly memorable, thanks to excellent voice acting and more than a few funny lines. Joker behaves as you'd imagine any Batman fanboy would if given the opportunity to go on a mission with the Dark Knight, revelling in going back to back with his idol, running through the ridiculous superhero names he considered before arriving at Joker, joyfully riding in the Batmobile, and taking pleasure in being mended by Alfred. Sadly, the fun and games are short-lived, as before long he's on the warpath.Episode 5 also gives Alfred a more prominent and meaningful role. Having been there for every step of Bruce's journey, from orphaned child to vigilante superhero, he's begins to realise that perhaps he's also been a negative influence, enabling Bruce's destructive lifestyle and failing in his job as a surrogate father. Telltale takes some bold steps to change the dynamic between the two characters, and it will be interesting to see how this carries over into future seasons, if they happen.Overall, Episode 5 of Telltale's Batman: The Enemy Within provides plenty of thrills and is a satisfying conclusion to the story. Although there are a few set-piece fights that are dynamic to watch, much of the actual gameplay remains focused on walking around environments and interacting with points of interest. It's a shame that the series as a whole didn't offer more opportunities to solve puzzles, as it did in the earlier in the series, but given the satisfying story payoff that's easy to forgive.Over the course of five episodes, the Batman: The Enemy Within has delicately developed John Doe and pulled strings to position Batman as a key player in his transition into Joker. While Telltale's first Batman season stuck a bit too close to established mythos and delivered an underwhelming ending, the second is a memorable Joker origin story that Bat-fans should make a point of playing."
1561,Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight,7.0,2,"lot of time-consuming dungeon crawling to consume in a relatively short period. The good news is that Etrian Odyssey Untold 2 is an engaging RPG that nails the fundamentals of dungeon exploration, much like the other games in the series. The bad news is that it doesn’t really offer much to alleviate the series fatigue that’s beginning to rear its ugly head. Etrian Odyssey Untold 2 is part of the “Untold” spinoff series, the defining feature of which is pre-made characters with distinct dialogue and personalities. This doesn’t really sound like a feature… unless you know that Etrian Odyssey is derived from the Wizardry school of first-person dungeon exploration RPGs: games where you would make a party out of blank slates of classes and abilities and then proceeded to trawl elaborate mazes laden with traps and treasure. That’s basically what Etrian Odyssey 1-4 (and Mystery Dungeon) were like. There was a story in the games--and usually a very good one--but it was presented more sporadically than the usual JRPG dialogue dumps. Etrian Odyssey Untold 2’s Story Mode is essentially remake of the Nintendo DS game Etrian Odyssey 2, but It starts with two fresh-faced young troopers from the Library of Midgard, Flavio the Survivalist and a character of your own creation, as they accept a mission from the Duchy of High Lagaard that involves protecting Princess Arianna on her journey to complete a ritual in the (story mode exclusive) Ginnugagap Ruins. When your personalized hero encounters mysterious hallucinations and vague memories of the past within the Ruins, he awakens to an amazing source of power - the all-new, transforming Fafnir Knight class. Joined by grumpy protector Bernhard and mousy War Magus Chloe, the team sets out to discover the mysteries of the Yggdrasil Labyrinth and the Ginnugagap Ruins--along with getting to the bottom of your newfound transformation ability. This setup is optional, and if you prefer the classic Etrian Odyssey experience, you can tap into the game's Classic mode, where every character is a blank slate, ready to be customized. You also get access to the Prince/Princess and Highlander classes that weren’t in the original Etrian Odyssey 2. Your character classes in Story mode are pre-defined, and you can’t just waltz into the guild and make additional characters as needed like in Classic mode. In order to change classes and access new skillsets, you need to use an option that removes five levels from your character. While it does mean having to manage less equipment across a massive guild of adventurers, it makes the experience feel more restrictive as a whole, and you're forced to grind for experience more than usual. The visual presentation is greatly enhanced over the original game--the dungeons and enemies are presented in 3D, just like Etrian Odyssey 4 and the first Etrian Odyssey Untold, but the core gameplay remains intact. Much of what makes a standard Etrian Odyssey adventure is 3D first person dungeons (which you map, square by square, on the bottom screen of the 3DS). Every floor you ascend brings new threats, and the fun lies in preparing, exploring, and conquering the unknown, even when that means encountering oppressively powerful enemies. One key diversion from the main Etrian Odyssey series is the Grimoire system. Rather than letting you assign two classes to a character, as Etrian Odyssey 3 and 4 do, you equip Grimoires on each character that bestow extra abilities, often ones that their class wouldn’t normally use. Grimoires have a random chance of dropping in battle, and they contain either a skill from your character or from the enemy they're fighting. It’s an interesting concept, but one that doesn’t really gel with the traditional Etrian Odyssey formula. While chance is a big part of the game--you’ll always cross your fingers when trying to hit something with status ailments--it’s incredibly irritating to have the process of learning extra skills be tied to a random factor. Assigning two classes per character and cashing in skill points for new abilities was a reward for hard work and dedication. Grimoires reward being lucky, which isn't motivating, and if you’re trying to get a specific Grimoire, it’s not clear if or how you can influence your chances of receiving it. Even though you can trade and recycle Grimoires as you progress, the whole system feels irritating and time-consuming compared to the old way of doing things. Beyond exploration and combat, there’s a new element in the hub town that seems ripped straight from Etrian Mystery Dungeon: the restaurant and town development. The local Duke employs you early on to help his granddaughter build and manage a restaurant. This task includes duties such as finding recipes and ingredients, which requires you to loot a dungeon or defeat all of its inhabitants, and advertising dishes to potential customers. You can eat the restaurant's dishes for temporary stat boosts, and if your advertising pans out, you even make a little money on the side. You can reinvest your profits to speed up construction in parts of Lagaard, which brings more people and potential customers to the city. Managing a restaurant and investing in the city doesn't steal the show, but it's a fun diversion that yields some nice rewards if you play your cards right. Etrian Odyssey Untold 2 has some flaws, certainly--the additions to the formula make it more accessible but don't ultimately enhance the game. On the other hand, it looks great, it retains the traditional Etrian Odyssey experience in Classic mode, and you still feel empowered after defeating a challenging FOE with only a sliver of health to your name. It's great to have a modern, reimagined version of the original Etrian Odyssey 2, but don't expect Etrian Odyssey Untold 2 to deliver a revolutionary experience if you've crawled through this dungeon before."
4895,Bigfoot: Collision Course,2.0,0,"  When Bob Chandler started work on the first Bigfoot monster truck in the mid '70s, he surely had no idea that his creation would spawn a popular new motorsport. He also couldn't have guessed that Bigfoot would be headlining a handheld racing game more than 30 years later. That's just as well, because if he'd known about Bigfoot Collision Course for the Nintendo DS back then, he might have abandoned the whole monster-truck idea to save us from it. Bigfoot Collision Course isn't just a racing game that lacks any real sense of speed--it's also a racing game with less than two hours' worth of uninspired content and which lacks any multiplayer component whatsoever. In short, it's almost impossible to recommend.        Gameplay options are limited to practice sessions, quick races, and a bare-bones Career mode. Practice sessions afford you an opportunity to drive around tracks without any opposition, but none of the course designs are even close to being challenging enough to warrant you learning your way around them. The Quick Race mode is literally pointless because the only difference between it and the Career mode is that you can't unlock any additional trucks or tracks in quick races. At the outset of your career, you have access to only two monster trucks, there are only four tracks to race, and you can compete only at an amateur level. Eight easy three-lap races later, you're done with the amateurs and can race in ""Pro Stock"" competitions. Winning races doesn't get any harder when you step up to the Pro Stock class, but the trucks are faster and some of the courses are a little longer. After winning another eight three-lap races, you get to go head-to-head against a truck named Bigwheels on the only remotely interesting course in the game, and after winning that, there's nothing else to do unless you feel compelled to go back and beat your best times.     Bigfoot Collision Course's only distinguishing feature is that you're encouraged to drive through obstacles rather than around them. Tracks are littered with oil drums, crushed cars, caravans, and even wooden shacks that you can crash through to replenish a power-boost meter that, when full, can be used to significantly increase your speed for a few seconds. There are also a lot of tree stumps, logs, and rocks on some of the tracks that, for the most part, you can just race over the top of. Occasionally, though, and seemingly at random these innocuous objects will bring your truck to a grinding halt and, if you're really unlucky, you might have to reverse and go around them because you no longer have the momentum to get over them.     There are 13 different monster trucks in Bigfoot Collision Course, with varying ratings in just two areas: speed and handling. Early on, your choices are limited to either fast trucks with appalling handling or slower trucks that are much easier to get around corners. You're generally better off with the latter, but you're in for a frustrating ride either way. Every truck that you unlock is better than the rest that are available, so you rarely use the same one for more than one or two races. Toward the end of the amateur and pro seasons, you gain access to trucks that can both drive fast and turn around corners with a minimum effort. Unsurprisingly, these are the licensed Bigfoot (""First Bigfoot"" and ""Bigfoot"") and Snake Bite (""Snake Bite 1"" and ""Snake Bite 2"") trucks, the latter of which, in real life, are actually Bigfoot trucks competing with different paint jobs.        Different track surfaces, which include sand, mud, and ice, have no effect on vehicle handling at all, and that holds true if you stray off of the track onto grass or snow. Walls that are either invisible or plastered with forest textures prevent you from straying too far, but they're overly punishing because contact with them invariably results in your truck getting stuck in them until you either reverse back out or manage to turn out of them while stuttering forward. Oddly, your truck stutters in a similar way for no discernable reason on the requisite ice track; the effect is that you appear to be making small jumps forward in much the same way that opponents with slow Internet connections do in some online racing games.     Stuttering aside, Bigfoot Collision Course runs smoothly, though that's no great feat given the simplistic visuals and lack of speed. Unfortunately, the quality of the audio is entirely in keeping with the quality of every other aspect of the game. Whereas you might expect a throaty roar of engines, you get what sounds like a troublesome lawnmower, and though all of the locations in the game could conceivably be in the United States, the soundtrack seems designed to give the impression that you're touring the world or something. Rock, tribal, and Indian restaurant are among the music genres poorly represented here, but given the quality of the engine noise, the optional music is the lesser of two evils.     Even with its budget price tag, Bigfoot Collision Course is a game that you should steer clear of. There's barely two hours of content here even if you manage to lose a few races along the way, and the very idea of a racing game with no multiplayer at all is laughable. Spend your money on a VHS copy of the Bigfoot and the Muscle Machines cartoon series before you spend it on this.  "
1607,Hatred,3.0,0," Here's what Hatred actually is: An isometric semi-open street-level shooter in which you kill designated numbers of progressively tougher adversaries before advancing to the next area. You have three main weapons--which you aim with an analog stick on your gamepad--as well as grenades, and the ability to duck. The basics are not terribly dissimilar from the first top-down iterations of Grand Theft Auto; Hatred is, ostensibly at least, an engine for quick, unthinking bursts of multidirectional fire, as opposed to, say, Hotline Miami’s trial-and-error kinetic problem solving. You can drive various vehicles, but they control like lead; fortunately, driving is optional, save for one stage near the end in which you control a SWAT van. Hatred's stark, Sin City aesthetic is irreproachable, and the number of destructible objects is astonishing. In too many other respects, however, there is precious little to say about Hatred: the action is simple, levels lack painfully in variation and escalation of arms, and frequent linearity only exacerbates the tedium. You simply wander through suburban neighborhoods and other mundane locales, mowing down whomever might happen to stand between you and your assigned kill count. There is no thrilling five-star moment in which whirring helicopters or SEAL Team Six members show up; the game’s idea of variety is to introduce armored enemies who don't die after being shot just once. Hatred has you firing almost endlessly at the same six or seven types of victims for a few hours, and then it ends. Aesthetics aside, it is thoroughly unspectacular, and any primal enjoyment you may be having wears off by the third stage. And so you have it. Hatred is a boring ‘80s-style arcade game with excellent visuals. There are dozens of better, cheaper games that do what Hatred does, which leaves one real reason why anyone might want to play it: Your primary targets are innocent, predominantly unarmed, uncharacterized civilians who run, scream, cry, beg for mercy, and endure brutal executions in order for you--the Antagonist--to remain alive. Unlike in Grand Theft Auto V or Saints Row, there's not even the flimsiest effort to provide a barrier of unreality. Bystanders are not simple victims of collateral damage: You are explicitly told to kill, “cleanse,” and “execute” the innocent. Problematically, Hatred isn’t fun to play. Its attempted power fantasy comes not from the exhilaration of superhumanity, but from the slaughter in and of itself, and unlike listening to a Slayer album or watching Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this is not a passive experience. Best of luck to anyone who can answer the question of why Hatred is meant to be, in the developer's own words, “pure gaming pleasure.” Yet there's an irony to Hatred. It might almost be a game worth clutching pearls over if the Antagonist never opened his mouth. But he does. Often. And while he exhibits a detached malevolence with his early one-liners, as you progress, there's a pronounced air of Metalocalyptic silliness, as the Antagonist grumbles about tasting the blood of innocent and proclaims everything as “stinking,"" “worthless,” or “pathetic,” with the same whining conviction of children who don’t want to eat their vegetables. He growls about how the only thing he hates more than politics is politicians, expressing his rage with all the murderous intent of a petulant Oscar The Grouch. The goofiness climaxes in the game's final moments: the acting reaches for Tommy Wiseau-level arch camp, to the point where it seems impossible to imagine that developer Destructive Creations meant for its shrug-worthy Dethgame to truly matter. Hatred isn't going to make mass murderers of anyone, but it still wants to be every mass murderer's favorite game. The shift in tone from horrifying psychopathy to mustache-twirling supervillainy feels like an intentional joke by the developers, an attempt to make Hatred a new generation’s Postal or Hong Kong 97--and it might have been funny if the rest of the game's particulars weren't a semi-monthly real-life tragedy.   But there’s an even greater irony at work here, in that having brutally killed thousands of innocents, survived police retaliation, and laid waste to everything good in the world, even while the Antagonist devours scenery behind the mic, you feel nothing. Hatred is too repetitive to be exciting, too dumb to be frightening, too basic for you to feel accomplished at its end, too dour to be violently cathartic, too self-serious to engender ironic amusement, and yet still too childish to matter. It will be given more credit than it’s worth--all a game like this can do is provide meager table scraps to a ravenous desire already deeply embedded in pre-existing monsters, and that's not a problem that treating Hatred as Videodrome made (new) flesh will cure. The fact that the final product fails even to be worth a primal psychotic scream of victory against society at large for the people it might encourage means it laughably fails even at being dangerous. Meaning, essentially, it's a nothing of a game."
3105,Sanctum (2011),7.0,2,"     In many respects, Sanctum is like most other tower defense games. Monsters emerge from predetermined spawn points and meander (or float, or scamper) down predetermined paths. Your goal is to destroy them by placing turrets along that path at strategic points. You also need to extend these bumbling buffoons' journey as best you can by building your turret blocks in such a way as to create mazes for them to traverse. While you're probably used to placing towers from an overhead view, in Sanctum, you do so from a first-person view. This can be disorienting at first, especially when planning out your maze. Luckily, you can switch to an overhead view to see how your labyrinth is coming along, though you can't actually build anything this way.         You make the most important strategic choices between waves. Do you spend resources on upgrading existing turrets or build new ones? Do you upgrade weapons or flesh out your labyrinth even further? You must be conscious of what enemies will be next coming down the pike when considering these questions. Bobble heads are most vulnerable to your own weapons, so an upgraded sniper rifle may be the way to go. But attending to the bobble heads might mean leaving the walkers that accompany them to your turrets, so you have to find an appropriate balance when spending your dough. The single-player portion of the game features a nice difficulty curve, allowing you to get your bearings early on and putting what you've learned to the test by the time you reach the final level. When you leave the campaign behind, you can join friends or strangers to tackle endless waves together. Developing a strategy while working with two resource pools is great fun, though the challenge ramps up considerably faster here than in single-player, so much so that you might get frustrated by how little damage even your fully upgraded weapons are doing. Unfortunately, there there are no other modes to conquer.      That wouldn't be so bad if Sanctum came with more than the three included levels, each of which is divided into 20, 25, or 30 waves. There is the expected replay value here in the form of multiple difficulty levels, and the strategic flexibility means you might have fun replaying levels to try out new approaches. Nevertheless, three levels is a low number compared to other such games, and at $14.99, you would rightfully expect more variety. (Consider, for example, such content-rich games as Toy Soldiers and Comet Crash, both of which delivered their own innovations.) At least these levels are lovely. Sanctum was created with the Unreal 3 engine--a fact you would probably notice early on, based on the telltale texture fade-in on your weapons and elsewhere. Yet the environments are undeniably attractive. Monsters emerge from thickets of lush flora where you glimpse birds flying through the sky. Giant glimmering flowers tower above, next to bulbous green orbs in which luminescent liquids flow--nature's answer to the lava lamp. It's a typical ""sci-fi jungle"" look, but it is evocative enough to hint at the possibility of a world beyond your limited game grid. Evocative, too, is the ambient menu music, which is unmatched by the more typical electronic beats you hear during gameplay.        Sanctum may not be bursting with features, but it's different enough to draw your attention, and it's entertaining enough to keep it. Online leaderboards and Steam achievements provide further incentive for you to keep playing, though they aren't substitutes for the variety that more levels and modes would have offered. But what's here is nice to look at, enjoyable, and often challenging. And when you take in the mess of limp corpses clogging your passageways, or snipe that last soaring menace just before it reaches its destination, you appreciate what Sanctum brings to the genre.    "
2951,BloodRayne: Betrayal,6.0,1,"     If you're curious about Rayne's genetic makeup, wonder no more. Her father is the vampire (which makes her mother a mere human), and he has certainly gotten on the wrong side of his fair daughter. Accompanied by a small army of less-than-able troops, Rayne storms her papa's palace to finish him off for good. The skimpy plot plays out in brief dialogue exchanges between the characters, and though it's good for an occasional chuckle, it lacks a memorable comedic punch. Likewise, the strong foundation of the visuals eventually shows copious cracks. Grotesque creature designs give personality to every being you meet (and beat) along the way. Rayne's model is nicely detailed and takes up a large portion of the screen, and it's a pleasure to watch her slice demons to shreds. But as good as the characters look, the backgrounds are just bland. They repeat continually throughout each level and enemies often blend in to their surroundings.           "
2945,Gears of War 3,10.0,2,"       An early revelation shocks Marcus Fenix, but you get only a glimpse of internal turmoil as he overrides his emotions to be the leader his squad needs. It isn't until halfway through the first act that the game really flexes its storytelling muscle. Stepping out of Marcus Fenix's boots, you play as Cole Train on a foraging mission to the town where he earned his reputation as a star athlete. Your first encounter with his past includes a simple line that foreshadows the journey you are about to take: ""You ever feel like you're dead, but nobody told you?"" As you catch more and more snippets of the life that used to be, the horrifying reality of the life that is begins to sink in deeper than it ever did before. By the time you see this chapter through its hallucinatory climax, you don't just have a whole new understanding of Augustus Cole; you have a richer understanding of what it must be like for everyone still alive on this war-ravaged planet. As the campaign progresses, different characters, environments, and situations intertwine to further flesh out your emotional investment in this world. Gears of War 3 delivers some truly poignant moments and boasts some of the best storytelling ever seen in a shooter, complemented by great facial animation, an expressive soundtrack, and excellent pacing.         Conflict zones vary widely in size and shape. Claustrophobic rooms channel you straight into your enemies, while larger areas give you plenty of room to flank your foes. Such spacious locations often play host to a new type of enemy spawn point, the Lambent stalk. Like the emergence holes before it, the stalk must be damaged to stanch the flow of enemies, and this can require some active maneuvering on your part. You need to use cover to stay alive, but you also must venture out into the field of fire to stop these spawn points and locate powerful weapons to wield against your foes. Returning favorites like the Mortar and Mulcher are joined by the One Shot (guess how it got that name) and the massive Vulcan, a devastating minigun that can only be moved by two people. Most of your arsenal is made up of guns that will be familiar to series veterans, providing a gruesome and satisfying array of ways to deal death at all ranges. Bullets still hit their marks with gratifying squish noises, and roaring chainsaws proclaim that the tried-and-true combat mechanics are once again in top form.        The pace and intensity of combat change drastically depending on your difficulty level and how many cooperative teammates you have along for the ride. The Gears of War 3 campaign supports four-player online co-op throughout (and two-player splitscreen), and it is an absolute blast to play with friends. Having actual humans on your team increases the campaign's natural sense of camaraderie, though the friendly AI still creates very capable companions. Still, having more folks along for the ride makes the battlefield feel more lively and encourages you to vary your play style to support and complement your teammates. Cooperative campaign play is one of the most exciting and rewarding modes that Gears of War 3 offers, and it's easy to drop in and out of a friend's game. It's a little trickier to join a public game, because you have to limit your search by act and difficulty level, but once you've found a match, you quickly take control of a Gear and start shooting. You can also play the campaign in Arcade mode and earn points for every enemy you kill. Racking up a big multiplier and notching a high score is gratifying, just as getting downed and watching your multiplier slip away is frustrating. Teamwork is crucial to high scores because you share a score multiplier, so a downed ally translates to points lost. A variety of Mutators let you mess with battlefield conditions to make things easier (every melee hit causes an explosion), harder (friendly fire is enabled), or just flat-out goofy (dialogue is complemented by a laugh track).        If you're looking to test your skills against other people in a more direct way, the Versus mode provides a bunch of great maps upon which to do battle. Up to 10 players can clash in a variety of game types, including staples like Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill. Other types make good use of specific gameplay mechanics, like Capture the Leader (hold an enemy hostage) and Execution (only executions will kill players). You can now resurrect yourself if you are downed, provided you have enough time, which adds extra incentive to close in for the kill. Furthermore, a number of these Versus game types have limited respawn counts, creating the possibility for some incredibly tense final showdowns.   Death can come quickly on these battlefields, especially if you get close enough to put the new sawed-off shotgun to work. Fortunately, newcomers can play in a kiddie pool of sorts before swimming with the sharks. A beginners-only multiplayer lobby ensures that you have a chance to compete against other novices and learn the ropes without getting mercilessly slaughtered at every turn. Once you join the murderous multiplayer hordes, you find that skillful movement is almost as crucial as skillful shooting. The difference between slow players and nimble players is more drastic here than in other shooters, meaning that with some practice, you can navigate these maps significantly faster than your opponents. This makes for a special breed of competition that deftly serves up the thrill of a great kill as well as the heartbreak of seeing your own intestines paint the floor.   Gears of War 2 makes a return here, once again pitting up to five human players against wave after wave of bloodthirsty Locust. This time around, however, you can use money earned by killing Locust to build fortifications and bolster your defenses. From a simple row of spikes to a makeshift turret to an apparently very convincing cardboard decoy, each element helps you deal with the enemy in a different way. The more you build, the better your improvements get and the better your chances of survival. You can only build between waves, however, and your resources are limited. Deciding what to build, what to repair, and when to save your money can make the difference between a long, successful run and a short, brutal run. This engaging strategic element livens up the already-frantic moments between waves when you are scrambling around to replenish your weapon stores from the guns your enemies dropped. Once the next wave begins, these assets disappear and it's just you, your teammates, and your defenses. Struggling to survive is an exciting challenge, and the extra tactical depth makes it that much more enjoyable.       Beast mode offers you a taste of how the other half lives. This is essentially an inverse Horde mode in which you (and up to four teammates) spawn as the Locust and try to slaughter increasingly strong groups of human survivors. Playing as the bad guy is every bit as sinister and satisfying as you want it to be, and like in Horde mode, you earn currency for all your gleeful murders. You then spend this resource to spawn as the type of Locust of your choosing, from the humble Ticker to the hulking Berserker. Time limits can be pretty tough in the early going, which forces you to aggressively seek out your prey. It can definitely take some trial and error to get the hang of each type of creature, and you may find yourself trying to execute a familiar maneuver but failing to do so. Not all Locust can use cover, for example, and sometimes your healing screams seem to stick in your throat. Fortunately, once you've worked it all out, Beast mode makes for some gory and challenging fun, with a range of difficulty levels that make it accessible to anyone.     In fact, accessibility is one of the strengths of Gears of War 3. Though it is an undeniably intense shooter, it scales very well to accommodate a range of skill levels. This is just one facet of the pervasive attention to detail that suffuses the whole game and gives you the sense that you are experiencing the pinnacle of the series. From the taut Versus competition to the two great cooperative modes, Gears of War 3 delivers immensely entertaining experiences on both sides of The Locust War. But the real triumph is the campaign, a masterpiece of exciting gameplay and emotional storytelling that stands head and shoulders above its predecessors. Even if you don't remember where you were on Emergence Day, this is one adventure you won't soon forget.   "
3166,Nintendogs + Cats,8.0,2,"  Owning a pet can be a joyous experience, but it's also a serious responsibility. No game can substitute for the real deal, but the lovable animals in Nintendogs + Cats convey about as much of the delight of owning a pet as you can reasonably expect, and you don't have to worry about having them ruin your furniture. It does away with one of the more interesting features of its predecessor, and the introduction of cats brings surprisingly little to the experience. But these charming virtual pets are sure to captivate players of all ages.          Nintendogs + Cats eases you into your new role as a pet owner. When you fire up the game for the first time, you find yourself at a kennel, presented with dogs from a range of breeds. (The nine breeds that are available to you initially depend on which version of the game you're playing, but over time, all 27 breeds can be unlocked in any version.) After selecting a breed you'd like to look at, you're asked to choose from categories within that breed. Select Labrador, for instance, and you're then asked to specify whether you'd like to see yellow, black, or chocolate Labs, and after selecting a variety, you meet three different dogs who meet that description. It's hard not to form an immediate sense of attachment to the adorable pups on offer that seem so happy to see you.      When you do get around to buying a feline, you find that cat owning is much less involved than dog owning. Unlike dogs, you can't teach cats tricks, take them for walks, or enter them in competitions. But it's a lot of fun to play with these lifelike kittens and to watch them climb up onto windowsills and bookshelves, as well as frolic with (or hiss at) your dogs. You can have up to three pets at home at any time, and you can leave up to three in the care of a pet hotel. You can also spend your hard-earned cash on new furniture or interior styles, decorating your home however you like.       So dogs are the star of the show. After bringing your puppy back to your spacious, sparsely furnished home, the dog (in our case, a female) will at first seem a bit anxious in her new surroundings. Showering the dog with attention and affection, however, helps calm her down, and the way she pants happily when you pet her may melt your heart. Soon, you're prompted to name your new pet, which you do by speaking her name into the microphone a few times. At this point, you can begin teaching your dog voice commands, beginning with the most basic: sitting down. Straightforward tutorials clearly explain how to teach your dog tricks, which include classics like sitting up and playing dead, as well as more unusual tricks, like the ability to sneeze on command. Your dog can learn up to three tricks a day, and positive reinforcement through petting and the awarding of treats helps when practicing to make your dog more obedient and responsive to your commands.     Teaching your dog these tricks is a rewarding way to bond with her, but it's not just for fun. It's also a way to earn some cold, hard cash. You can compete in obedience trials where you're awarded points based on how well your dog responds to specific commands. These competitions use the 3D camera and the AR cards that come with the handheld to make it appear as if the dog is in your real-world environment. (The effect is a bit jittery and unconvincing, but the feature is good for taking still photos of your virtual pets in your actual kitchen or living room.) In addition to the obedience trial, you can enter your dog in lure-coursing races and in flying-disc competitions. In lure coursing, your goal is to wind a lure on a string at a brisk, steady pace and lead your dog down a track. Go too fast and your dog will lose interest and stop racing after the lure. Go too slow and your dog will pounce on the lure and cost you valuable seconds. In the flying-disc competition, you earn more points based on how far your dog runs before catching the disc, scoring bonus points for jumping catches.         If you want your dog to do well in competitions (and if you want your conscience to let you sleep at night), you need to take good care of her, feeding her and giving her water frequently, as well as giving her baths when needed. Your dog needs love, too; if you come back to the game after the better part of a day or more away, she will be starved not just for food but also for affection, though this is easily remedied by spending a bit of time petting or playing with your dog. The most involved aspect of caring for your dog is taking her for walks. Those who played the original Nintendogs may have fond memories of the way walking worked in that game, where you plotted your own course around town and were able to go a bit farther on each walk than you were before. Sadly, the sense of exploration that came with determining your own path around town is gone here.     Instead, you walk along straight pathways through different areas, including downtown, the mountains, and the seaside. Before long, you're given the option to follow signposts from one area to another, but that's the extent of your control over where your walks take you. On these walks, you clean up after your dog, tapping poop to put it in a bag for disposal. You also try to train your dog to stop engaging in bad behaviors like playing in puddles and getting her coat all dirty by giving the leash quick tugs and reinforcing good behavior with treats. Additionally, your dog finds presents to bring you as you stroll down the path. These nicely wrapped packages often contain goods like rubber and metal bolts, which, when you've collected enough, you can trade in at the secondhand store for new toys.     Each area has places where you can stop and play with your dog or give her special treats. There's a gym where you can practice lure coursing, a pleasant seaside park that's great for throwing the flying disc around, and a cafe in town that makes delicacies just for dogs, to name a few. The most pleasant aspect of walking your dog is the frequent encounters with other dog owners. These friendly folks are happy to share tips about taking care of your dog or more effectively training her for competitions. And if your dog and the other dog hit it off, you might get the option to let the dogs go on a playdate at the park together. These encounters make you feel like part of a friendly community of dog owners.       By selecting the pedometer option from an in-game menu, you can also take your dog for walks while the 3DS is closed. With this option activated, the game keeps track of how many steps you've taken; the farther you've walked, the happier your dog will be and the more presents she will have collected for you when you open the 3DS again. Additionally, Nintendogs + Cats makes good use of the 3DS's StreetPass functionality. If your 3DS communicates with a friend or stranger's 3DS, you'll receive a present from the other dog owner's collection of stuff, and you can have a playdate at the park with the other dog.     The lifelike behavior and the adorable appearance of the animals in Nintendogs + Cats is essential to making this such a sweet and endearing game. The game also benefits from 3D visuals, which give a sense of depth and space to your home, the park, and the other environments, as well as create the illusion that you can reach right into the screen to touch your pets. If you're in the market for a furry bundle of love that won't jump on the bed and lick your face at 3:00 in the morning, or if you know a young person who wants a pet but might not quite be ready for the responsibility of the real thing, you won't find more adorable virtual animals than those in Nintendogs + Cats.

1719,The Order: 1886,5.0,1,"The Order: 1886 is a torturer and a tease. It promises you a circuitous story populated with near-immortal knights, it promises you exciting encounters with snarling werewolves, it promises you clever weaponry the likes of which you rarely see in video games. It dangles these hopes in front of you and then yanks them away, reneging on one promise after another, letting you hold that precious toy in your hand and then denying you the chance to maintain the thrill. The Order is cruel in the way it plays with your expectations, taking a promising premise and then sucking out much of the energy with boring cutscenes, an ending wholly devoid of closure, and shooting-gallery action sequences. ""Boring"" is the best word to describe The Order in general, actually. That this third-person action game turns a parade of steampunk imagery and Arthurian legends into a dull stew of modern games' most tiresome cliches is quite a feat, though hardly one worth celebrating. It is (as you probably guessed) 1886, and you are Grayson, otherwise known as Galahad, one of the Knights of the Round Table. It is a time of trouble: common citizens have begun to rebel against the gentry, possibly allying with a race of werewolves the game alternately refers to as lycans and half-breeds. It's a brilliant setup, ripe with possibilities. You look to the sky and see zeppelins hovering overhead; you look to the armory, and you find a young Nikola Tesla ready to introduce you to clever armaments. That such a world could be so lifeless is unfathomable. Yet The Order turns the mystical into the mundane. You face lycans early on, leaping out of the way and shooting them down before killing them off for good by plunging a knife into them. And then they are cast aside for hours until the half-breeds are barely a memory. The Order pulls them out of hiding a few more times, though the circumstances are highly controlled, and conclude with the kind of anticlimax that becomes the game's calling card. The most dramatic of these few battles end with quick-time focused snoozes that betray the very idea of confronting such beasts. As for the nature of the lycans--where they come from, what their presence has meant for humanity, how humans could ally with such creatures--most of that is left to your imagination. Developer Ready at Dawn doesn't address the most interesting aspects of its own ideas. Instead, the story focuses on its stale protagonists, who sit and argue at the round table every so often while getting to the bottom of the rebel plot. What a shame that interesting supernatural and social elements would be sidelined in favor of boardroom shenanigans, particularly given the light character development. I applaud the cast: the voice acting is brilliant, far better than the material deserved, and it is the acting talent alone that invested me in the characters' fates. The soundtrack, thick with cellos and violas, also rises above the blandness, but by the time the finale and its predictable quick-time events arrive, it is too late to squeeze emotion from this dry turnip. The credits roll after the button press that serves as an ending, and vital story threads are left dangling in the wind. Perhaps the Order: 1886 means to hint at a sequel, but whether or not that was Ready at Dawn's intention, it's a disrespectful end to a plodding story. This may have been a fine close to the second act of a three-act story, but it's a rude sendoff to anyone hoping for explanation or reason. How bizarre, then, that The Order is so focused on its narrative. During the initial sequences, you may assume that it is more Heavy Rain than Uncharted: you respond to threats by pressing the right buttons when prompted. As it happens, The Order is divided more or less equally into four disparate pieces: cutscenes, QTEs, walking around, and shooting. In time, the game strings these features into poorly-paced sequences that have no sense of rhythm. It is the modern action game personified: This is the part where I walk for three minutes, and now comes the short bit where I have to pick a bunch of things up and look at them, and then comes the brief shooting part that practically ends before it begins. Walking, looking, and shooting aren't bad on their own, of course. What makes such basic mechanics so predictable and rote in The Order is how they are used. When the game forces you to holster your weapon and walk at a snail's pace, you may expect it to build tension or to develop its characters. Instead, The Order becomes an exposition machine, dropping basic plot points until you either open the door that leads to the next ultra-linear stage of the ultra-linear level, or another character does it for you. The sequences in which you examine your surroundings looking for clues are even more tedious. You trudge about a room, picking up objects and looking at them, perhaps even turning them over in your hands before setting them down. In a few instances, the game might identify a detail of interest, and you have to press a button to continue, though the overall goal is typically to pick up everything in the vicinity until you trigger the next event--and in at least one case, you aren't even the one to discover the pertinent information, making all of that monotonous strolling aggravatingly pointless. A few weapons aside, you're rarely looking at anything of interest: old photographs of characters you barely know (if at all), letters that provide the tiniest morsel of backstory, and so forth. That The Order is so in love with its own object models is almost laughable: You pick up minor knick-knacks and lovingly rotate them as if you have discovered the Holy Grail. Yes, this model ship is lovely, but was the self-congratulatory time-padder necessary? I presume that The Order: 1886 wishes to build its world by demanding you admire the details, but Ready at Dawn needn't have tried so hard to point out how pretty their art is: it is simply pretty, full stop. The game has a few of the standard tricks up its sleeve to gloss over the occasional flaws: motion blur, a subtle film grain effect, overzealous depth-of-field effects, and the such. It's difficult to overlook The Order's tonally consistent aesthetics, however: It is fully committed to its style. From a bridge's vantage point, you wield an electrically charged cannon while gazing upon a smoky Victorian London. The bridge is dotted with iron carriages, some still sturdy, and some ravaged by the ongoing firefight. Rococo flourishes adorn the Knights' chamber: walls decorated with gold leaf, floors embellished with Latin script, flickering candles embedded within serpentine sconces. The Knights' weathered faces aren't quite beautiful, but they are remarkably human; Each of the Lord Chancellor's grimaces and squints betray a soul-crushing history you wish you could have partaken in. The action is almost an afterthought, given all the talking, the walking, and the quick-time events, few of which complement onscreen motion in the manner of Telltale Games' best QTEs. It's a shame that The Order evokes Heavy Rain so early in its six-hour play time, because the comparison does not work in this game's favor. The Order clearly has cinematic aspirations, regardless: The loose camera hews close behind you, to the point where you can not often see much of the battlefield once you have taken cover. The game is at its best when it allows itself to be a shooter, which is what makes its failings all the more disheartening. The thermite rifle is one of the most interesting weapons in recent memory, letting you fire a round of magnesium ammo and then ignite it with a rush of air. What a blast it is to mess with such a unique firearm--and what a heartbreaker to have such grossly limited use of it. The same is true of the previously mentioned cannon: It is ripped from your hands all too quickly and replaced with less-interesting pistols and carbine rifles. Those weapons function just fine, at least. The level design is functional, too, but uninspired. You know a turkey shoot is about to begin as you enter an area and see all the obvious cover spots--and then the turkeys appear, right on schedule, ready to die at your hands. Expectedly, such predictability breeds apathy. Grenade-lobbing supersoldiers aside, it's all too easy to mow down the opposition, making the blacksight mechanic, which allows you to temporarily slow down time and pelt foes with bullets, all but unnecessary on medium difficulty. There's a system in place for recovering if you are downed in combat, but it, too, is superfluous: should you fall, a rebel soldier almost always lands a killing shot. All of these gameplay tropes are then shoved together into herky-jerky levels that end just when you think they might gain momentum. The only individual sequence lengthy enough to find a rhythm is a later stealth level, though it's far too simple to inspire wishes for more sneaky sections. What, then, to make of The Order: 1886? It is, at best, perfectly playable, and lovely to look at and listen to. But it is also the face of mediocrity and missed opportunities. A bad game can make a case for itself. A boring one is harder to forgive."
380,Nioh 2,8.0,2,"Editor's note: Sony recently released Nioh 2 Remastered, a technically upgraded PS5 version of Nioh 2 for PS5 and PC. The new version is available as a free download for players who already own Nioh 2 on PS4, and as part of The Nioh Collection, a next-gen re-release. After playing the first few hours, Mike Epstein has some impressions on how the changes impact the PS5 version of the game. Continue after the break to read his original review of Nioh 2. It’s hard to say exactly how much Nioh 2 Remastered does to improve the look and feel of Nioh 2, a game played for the first time less than a year ago. Both Nioh Remastered and Nioh 2 Remastered feature new modes that allow you to choose between playing in 4K or 120 frames per second. PS5 players also have a console specific “PS5 Standard” mode that’s reportedly calibrated for the console. Though both modes run at high fidelity and with smooth frame rates, I found the 4K mode was slightly brighter, which created more contrast and better lighting effects.Even with the jump from 1080p to 4K--I originally reviewed Nioh 2 on a standard PS4, not a Pro--the upgrades to Nioh 2 Remastered don’t create striking changes in 4K or PS5 Standard Mode. You see it sometimes: the way moonlight reflects off the cherry blossoms in the first level, for example, or when the frame rate remains stable in chaotic combat situations. It is an upgrade, but not one that will take your breath away or make you want to play the game all over again.There’s one huge improvement, though, which makes Nioh 2 Remastered the definitive way to play this game. The load times, which used to be incredibly long for a game that wasn’t afraid to kill you in a few seconds, are now borderline instantaneous. That alone takes much of the sting out of Nioh 2’s maddening difficulty. It’s much easier to fight a boss 10 or 20 times if you don’t have to wallow in your defeat after each death. Mike's original Nioh 2 review, first published in March 2020, continues below. "
3701,American Idol,5.0,1," Codemasters' new rhythm action game, based on American Idol, attempts to combine the timing-based, performance-emulating mechanics of games like Parappa the Rapper with the pageantry of entertainment mastermind Simon Cowell's feverishly popular reality TV series. Neither of these facets of American Idol is executed quite right, thus producing a game that's built on compromise.      The action in American Idol is directly derivative of mechanics found in Koei's inspired rhythm action game Gitaroo Man. However, the mechanics lifted from Gitaroo Man represent only a portion of that title's gameplay system, and they were better implemented in Gitaroo Man as well. In American Idol, you're presented with a cross in the center of the screen, while in the background you're shown an avatar who is crooning the song. Button commands move from the tips of the cross toward the center, and the closer the icon is to the center of the cross when you press the button, the better your avatar's singing will be. Inversely, if you screw up and your timing's off, the singing will falter by going off-key and losing its timing. The bad singing is done really well by making it apparent when you're not playing right. The gameplay is fairly simplistic, with all of the action occurring on the face buttons of your controller, though it'll regularly throw you some curves. The speed and complexity of the button commands can get pretty rough in the expert difficulty level, but even then the judges are pretty forgiving, so you really have to butcher a song pretty badly not to win. The game also supports a Dance Dance Revolution-style dance mat, though this mode is ridiculously easy. American Idol's gameplay is shallow and easy, and, unfortunately, the game doesn't have much to compensate for this.   The heart of American Idol is the competition mode, where you create your own American Idol contestant with aspirations of being the new Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Studdard. You'll start in the audition room, move to the theater, and finally end up on the American Idol stage. Unfortunately, the gameplay remains the same the entire time. So, basically, you perform a song, listen to critiques from the judges, and then repeat. Since you'll be on ""TV,"" your appearance factors in to how well your performance is received, so American Idol includes a little dress-up mode where you can choose a variety of different outfits. You're given a rating on your apparel after finishing a song, but how that rating actually weighs in to the judging process is unclear.   There are several other options beyond the main competition mode in American Idol, but they are all pure filler. The rehearsal mode lets you try out songs without being judged. The party mode lets you and some friends each take a crack at a song; then you get to judge the other players' performances, which--with the people who are singing also doing the judging--seems like it could get really political really fast. The karaoke mode barely counts as a game. You're presented with a lyric-less version of one of the songs, and the lyrics are presented at the bottom of the screen. At the end of the song, there's an option to ""judge"" the performance, after which you're dumped back to the menu screen. Finally, the jukebox mode lets you listen to the game's amateur renditions of the pop songs featured on the soundtrack, which seems a bit pointless. If you wanted to hear these songs, wouldn't you just go listen to the originals?   Though, to be fair, the song selection in American Idol is the game's best asset, consisting of 43 pop songs that cover a surprising range. The songs, however, never stray from the kind of material that you'd hear contestants on the show actually singing. There are many different renditions of ""Hit Me One More Time,"" ""Livin' La Vida Loca,"" and similarly obvious choices that exist right alongside more interesting selections, like The Commodores' ""Easy,"" Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together,"" and George Michael's ""Fastlove."" Some people might be projecting their own star fantasies when they watch American Idol, but the dark, underlying appeal of this nationally televised talent show is seeing Simon Cowell rip enthusiastic--but undertalented--aspiring performers to shreds. In this respect, the game fails pretty thoroughly. The game features original voice work from American Idol judges Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, and Simon Cowell, but their readings are flat and apathetic, and the number of lines recorded are so limited that you'll hear several of the judges' comments repeated through the course of a single career game.      The game definitely looks worse than it sounds. The characters, who are presented with a low-rent cel-shading effect, are boxy and poorly animated. You'll rarely see a contestant doing more than a little side-to-side shuffle while performing. The different environments, which look roughly like the different locales used by the show (except much more simplified), are coated in grainy textures that exhibit some pretty bad color-banding. There's really not much else to say about the visuals in American Idol because there's really not that much to them.   Though the rhythm game format seems like a natural fit for the American Idol property, its execution betrays the concept, and the end results just don't do the show justice. Perhaps a more interesting game would be an American Idol adventure game, where you play as Simon Cowell and have to pick through dialogue trees to choose what sort of venomous remarks you'll make to the contestants. If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want American Idol, just go watch the show.  "
4529,SnoCross 2: Featuring Blair Morgan,4.0,0,"  SnoCross 2: Featuring Blair Morgan hasn't had the smoothest development cycle. It was originally shown at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was slated to appear on both the Xbox and PlayStation 2, with online play to boot. Since then the Xbox version has been scrapped, as has the online functionality. What did finally get released is a budget-priced PlayStation 2 game that's not a whole lot of fun to play. Even if you can get past the atrocious presentation and frustrating gameplay, there's always a new problem waiting to make sure you can't enjoy what little there is good about the game.         Racing options are limited to career, quick race, and split-screen modes, which run surprisingly well considering how poorly the game runs during single-player races. You start your career by picking your rider's gender and then outfitting your racer with some clothes and gear. If nothing tickles your fancy, don't worry--you'll unlock plenty of gear as you progress through your career. Next you get to purchase a snowmobile. There are a handful of unlicensed craft to choose from, each with slightly different attributes. If you have any cash left over, you can upgrade your ride's suspension, engine, tread, and skis. Like with the clothing, more upgrades and items become available as you win races.     Once your rider is all squared away, it's time to go racing. The career mode is divided into multiple series, which in turn feature both racing and trick-based events. The racing is pretty simple. You negotiate the winding courses and try to avoid obstacles while performing tricks to fill your boost so that you can beat three other racers to the finish line. Occasionally this is fun, but the other 80 percent of the time it's not. The races are far too easy, and you can win by 30 seconds even if you've fallen a dozen times. Even if your snowmobile has been upgraded, it controls poorly. Usually the game is rather forgiving, but you'll still have issues turning and landing your craft. The funky controls combined with broken physics make it an adventure every time you catch some air or hit a bump that you think should be a jump but stops you cold in your tracks. SnoCross 2 has some fun moments, such as when you've got a big lead and don't have to worry about every little crash, but these moments are short-lived.     Though the racing is far from good, it's much better than the trick attack events, in which you're still going around a course, but rather than trying to finish first, your goal is to earn the most trick points. Tricks are performed by pressing the circle button in midair and then a direction on the D pad. Some of the tricks are interesting, but you've probably seen them countless times in other games. For some reason madly pressing the circle button doesn't always activate a trick--until it's too late and the trick is activated right as you're about to land. Even if you do pull off a few successful tricks, it's a crapshoot as to whether or not you'll actually land them because you never know when your snowmobile is going to end up on its side, face-first, or upside down. The trick mode wouldn't be so bad if it were as forgiving as the normal races, but the CPU is tough, and you'll have to really practice to win even the amateur events.     The tremendously boring course design doesn't do much to improve either event type. Random piles of boxes, piles of lumber, and tugboats block your path; jumps lead you right into walls or off cliffs; and it's always annoying to think you're taking a shortcut only to find that the underground tunnel is actually a solid wall. Wile E. Coyote would be proud. Thanks to poor level design and the fact that everything looks the same, it's really easy to get turned around the wrong way. You can push the select button to warp back on the course facing the right direction, but it's still sometimes difficult to figure out where to go next. You might think that you can do better with the included create-a-track feature, but save yourself some heartbreak; you won't be creating any masterpieces.        It probably goes without saying that none of the courses are particularly interesting to look at. They're mostly devoid of scenery, and they're all pretty dreary. Occasionally there's something brown to liven things up, but for the most part everything's white or gray. There's so much fog on some courses that it makes San Francisco look like the Bahamas. Effects are almost nonexistent, with the only exception being some ugly rain and snow. The riders look decent and their trick animation isn't too bad. The snowmobiles look OK, though they don't show any damage and the snow they kick up looks pitiful. Even with mostly empty courses and embarrassing Nintendo 64-quality textures the game doesn't manage to convey any sense of speed. At its best the frame rate is erratic, and that's when you're the only rider onscreen; as soon as another rider gets near, the frame rate falls apart, which makes the game nearly unplayable. Unsurprisingly, the game's audio is terrible. Bland rock music with (thankfully) no vocals plays in the background, and the snowmobiles roar with all the fury of an electric mixer...set on low.      Even at the low price of $14.99 SnoCross 2 isn't worth a purchase. Snowmobile racing fans will be disappointed by the lack of authentic riders and licenses, and everyone will be let down by the poor quality of the racing, the ugly graphics, and basically everything else.   "
896,West of Loathing,8.0,2,"The backbone of the game is its jokes and ingrained humor. Every little thing in West of Loathing serves as either a punchline or the lead-up to one. It exists in the writing naturally--the main narrative involves a bizarre cataclysmic event involving demon cows and rodeo clowns. The flavor text is filled with irony and wordplay, and conversations with characters play out like short sketches. The sheer amount of jokes draws you into Loathing's crudely drawn and ludicrous world, but what's more impressive is that they rarely fall flat, and if they do, there's often another to draw your attention away immediately.But West of Loathing's consistent sense of humor runs deeper, woven throughout your interactions and the game's menus and UI. Attempting to search spittoons for items will engage you in long lectures from the narrator as they attempt to stop you from doing so by describing, in great detail, how disgusting what you're trying to stick your hand into is. Choosing to playfully boast that ""Sneaky"" is your middle name will discreetly change your middle name on your character screen to just that. Searching a shelf and finding a book entitled ""The Art of Silly Walking"" will unlock a new character perk, which adds a new toggle in the game's system menu to visibly change the way your character moves in-game to everything from cartwheels to swimming. These are just a few very early examples of the game's sense of humor, but West of Loathing's commitment and follow-through on its jokes will surprise and delight you throughout its entire duration.You begin the game by selecting from one of three different classes--farcical takes on familiar RPG character tropes. The Cow Puncher is a warrior-style class, the Bean Slinger uses legumes as a source of magic, and the Snake Oiler is the rogue equivalent. But although each class comes with their own set of unique skills, and a convenient option for auto-leveling will build out a nicely rounded character for you of that archetype, West of Loathing also allows you the flexibility of manually assigning experience points to build whatever kind of character you want. That means there's nothing stopping you from having a physically adept Bean Slinger who can also pick locks, or a Cow Puncher with a high moxie stat and the cunning required to outfox his opponents.West of Loathing's combat consists of a simple turn-based system situated on a 3x6 grid. There are some small nuances to consider regarding positioning and using cover when facing opponents with ranged attacks, and a number of consumable items can be used in battle to cause various effects. But aside from the novelty of seeing the amusing enemy and ability designs in battle, combat is a straightforward affair.What's more interesting about West of Loathing's mechanics is that it is as much of an adventure game as it is an RPG, and one of the by-products of this is that there are multiple solutions to any given problem--and there is nearly always a completely viable alternative to engaging in battle. Having the right item in your inventory (some of which have multiple uses both in and out of combat), enough points in a particular statistic, or certain abilities unlocked means that you can complete quests or resolve random encounters without violence and still get enough experience points to spend on character progression. If you don't have the goods to pass these skill checks when you first encounter an obstacle, West of Loathing allows you to come back later with the right stuff if you so desire; it doesn't force you into any combat situations without warning, and it's a very welcome, player-friendly decision.There are a few minor issues--inventory management on Switch becomes cumbersome as you collect an increasing amount of things, fights with a lot of enemies can obscure some pertinent information, and the stakes sometimes feel a little too low to be completely motivating. But West of Loathing's focus on maintaining a flexible, open-ended nature and lighthearted, humorous feel keeps you engaged in what feels like an imaginative pen-and-paper Dungeons and Dragons campaign, led by a game master whose only goal is to make sure you're laughing and having a fun time. West of Loathing's visuals are monochromatic, but there's enjoyable comedy painted between every line, a pitch-perfect Spaghetti Western soundtrack, and a full spectrum of role-playing possibilities to choose from that make it a consistently enjoyable madcap cowboy jaunt."
514,Project Warlock,6.0,1,"Before you're even 100% certain of what you're doing or who you are in Project Warlock, you're put in a room with a magical throwing knife, a staff that shoots lightning, and a couple of pissed-off spiders who aren't there to thank you for playing their game. Within 10 seconds of starting, I'm back in high school, in 1998, installing any old creaky Doom WAD a friend tells me about over AIM for the hell of it, without a single blessed clue what needs doing except that anything that isn't me must die.That's really the main draw of Project Warlock, a game that wears its '90s FPS inspirations loudly and proudly. Despite a few interstitial cards between areas, there's no deep story or motivation or pageantry to be found here. It's just you and your arsenal of magical and military weaponry vs the supernatural hordes. At any given moment, it's paying deep homage to Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, Heretic, Quake, Duke Nukem--the list goes on. The question, however, is what exactly does Project Warlock bring to the table that's unique? The answer is, ultimately, not a whole lot, but what it does, it certainly does well enough.The style clash between all the game's wild, anachronistic elements certainly counts for something. This is a game where you can take out lurching cyborgs with a crossbow, wield laser rifles against abominable snowmen, and kill Lovecraftian horrorbeasts with a submachine gun. That mix makes for a smirking, free-wheeling sort of game where every problem has a brute-force solution from somewhere in the annals of history or legend. If a shotgun can't fix all your problems in this game, a fiery magic spell probably will, and vice versa. There isn't necessarily a wrong approach for many of Project Warlock's challenges. As long as you know which button pulls the trigger and which one opens doors, you're generally fine. And no matter which weapon you wield--from magic staffs to double-barrelled shotguns to sticks of dynamite--the vast majority of your arsenal packs an absolute wallop when it hits.The catch, of course, is that Project Warlock periodically does demand more of you than just killing everything in sight, and the game's dedication to not getting in your way with pesky exposition or rudimentary tutorials can work against it. When you start the game, it's safe to assume that your basic melee weapon for when you run out of ammo--which happens quite a bit in the early hours--is a slow but powerful axe. It's not until you take a look at the controls in the options menu that you realize each weapon has a magical alternative. Instead of the axe, you can switch to an enchanted dagger of some sort that can shank enemies that get too close--but it can also be thrown an infinite number of times, often doing more damage than the weaksauce capgun they give you and call a pistol. New weapons, spells, and powerups just kind of spontaneously happen in this game for the most part. Those that don't just randomly drop out of enemies and barrels, you can get by spending perk points--currency gained every time you level up--but the XP needed to gain them is slow to accumulate, and it's not until you experiment with the various upgrades for your weaponry, stat boosts, and spells that you start to get a handle on how to do some real damage instead of chipping away at the more formidable foes. That can take some time, and it's a real problem that there's nothing in-game that tells you about any of it.That's fine in situations where failing miserably is expected, and failing has low stakes. On its normal difficulty, however, Project Warlock has a set number of extra lives to use, after which it's game over, and progress is completely wiped with no continues. Much of Project Warlock is fairly easy to navigate, with difficulty often ramping up in terms of sheer numbers of enemies rather than any one particular enemy type posing a threat. Bosses, however, have a habit of smacking you around with cheap hits, and throwing yourself against that wall without being mindful that you are mortal is a disheartening shock to the system. The casual difficulty option thankfully gives you the infinite lives such a game demands, but it's logical to be a bit disappointed about a roguelike element being thrown into a game that otherwise rewards haphazard bravery.The only other modern flourishes the game has mostly come from the look and sound. While it's still using garish 2D FPS sprite mapping for the graphics, there's an impressive level of interactivity with the environments, from being able to break a castle's stained glass windows in an explosion to the light spell you can use to brighten a dark area at will. The art style isn't without its flaws, however. The way every object in range turns with you to remain flat is a bit dizzying after a while and is all the more pronounced given the big, bright, Minecraft-y voxels used to build everything. In general the way each stage is laid out starts to feel constrained and uninspired after a while. There isn't really a sense of verticality or an architectural logic to how these areas are designed. But again, in its own weird way, that, too, is a gentle reminder of what it was like to play FPS games in the '90s. The soundtrack, on the other hand. is actually the best part of the game, melding old-school synth riffs on thrash, speed, and prog metal with dark, modern EDM beats. It sounds like a Hotline Miami game that takes place in Hell, and in the later hours, hearing what kind of tune we get next became a primary motivator for me.When I look back on '90s FPS games, there are things unique to each series that immediately come to mind. It's easy to remember Doom's Martian landscape desecrated with Satanic symbols and the distant snarls beckoning me closer. I remember feeling like an all-powerful wizard in Hexen, burning orcs and sorcerers alive with the fire I conjured from my hands. I remember the instantly iconic nailgun in Quake, and Nine Inch Nails telling me in the background that everything around me is about to learn a harsh lesson. But there isn't really anything particularly memorable about Project Warlock that's separable from its inspirations. The game isn't without its charms in the moment, but when its inspirations are so readily available, it doesn't really have much to offer against the real deal."
4376,Shattered Suns,4.0,0,"  Fully 3D real-time strategy games set in space are a rare breed. Adding the third dimension seems to scare off both developers and gamers, so many games simply ignore the oft-confusing vertical plane and stick to 2D stellar battlefields. Shattered Suns is a good example of why so many people shy away. The Clear Crown Studios game is certainly adventurous enough, due to the ostensibly more realistic depiction of outer space, the mix of RTS and 4X space sim traits, and a few innovative touches when it comes to custom ship design; but the production values are bottom-drawer, and your galactic adventures are highlighted by boring resource management and simplistic combat that doesn't really utilize those three dimensions. These issues, along with some serious problems with the in-game camera, all but ruin the reasonably original game design.        Originality doesn't extend to the plot, however. In the single-player campaign, you play Captain Max, a former starship commander in the Statian military who's drafted back into active duty during an invasion by the evil Qalan and Trexon Empires. So the story deals with the standard one-man-against-the-alien-hordes shtick, albeit with the rather interesting addition of a love story. At the same time as Max is trying to save Statia, he's also searching star systems for his missing fiancee, a fellow officer with the much more exotic name of Seeng-Si. A fair bit of the game is spent with the hero dithering over his duty and chucking it all to search for his woman, which gives the game a bit of teen-love cheese, as nobody over 17 actually thinks like Captain Max.     Still, much of this tale is fairly well told, regardless of the lapses into 90210 melodrama. The one huge flaw is that every plot point is described through text, as though you're playing the game via instant messenger. As the budget apparently didn't allow for any cutscene production, a single screen filled with a drab starfield map and a huge block of tiny, hard-to-read green-on-black text conveys all of the story and dialogue. Even some full missions take place here and are resolved entirely through answering questions. Many of the lines are well written, although apparently the designers realized this and allowed the writer free rein to ramble on to absurd lengths. Scenes meander for many, many minutes, and you're stuck waiting for every single line to slowly pop up onscreen because you can't skip ahead. All of this dialogue goes beyond sci-fi boilerplate to help develop realistic characters with depth and personality (like your snarky computer assistant, Citron), although it's hard to appreciate any of it when you're screaming ""Get on with it!"" at your monitor. More appeal is lost due to the text scaling in lower-resolution displays. Letters are shrunk to what looks like an 8-point height and scrunched so tightly together that you soon squint your way into serious eyestrain or a king-size headache. Keep eyedrops and ibuprofen on hand.     Shattered Suns isn't particularly easy on the eyes during missions, either. Ship design is generic, textures are plain, and the lighting and shadow effects are so primitive that there is no depth to any of the models. Star systems are just as rough and ready, with basic planet types like Earth look-alikes and lava worlds. The background is really odd looking, too, due to the inclusion of so much green nebulae gas that it overwhelms what should be a very black outer space. At times, this backdrop is so green and lush that it seems more like you're waging war in front of an English country garden than the inky darkness of space. Ship movements and explosions are nothing short of embarrassing. Vessels avoid colliding with planets by simply jerking to one side or the other, and the usual pyrotechnics of ships going ka-boom have been replaced with wimpy puffs of smoke and chunks of debris flying in all directions. And despite the game's low-rent appearance, loading times can be onerous. Initially loading the game up takes so long that you can not only safely duck out of the room to make a sandwich, you just might have time to bake the bread, too.     Of course, really ugly games sometime boast some really stellar gameplay. But that isn't the case here, as Shattered Suns is just as unappealing within as it is without. The game sort of blends typical RTS gaming with 4X space sims, with campaign missions that are split among building fleets for combat, focusing on space-station base building, and fulfilling economic duties such as setting up a trade route or gathering resources. You generally accept an order at the beginning of the assignment to do something like juggle the game's three resources of crystals, ore, and credits in an effort to repair ships, set up a mining operation on a moon, or simply crank out ships and blast into a system to annihilate the enemy. Everything is pretty straightforward. Most resource management can be done with a couple of clicks. To mine a planet for ore, for example, all you need to do is load up a ship with miners and send it on its way. Combat is equally simplistic, with the only complication provided by the ability to rig up different ship production lines on space stations to crank out vessels for different purposes. So you can build one line of ships with huge storage capacity to serve as cargo carries, another line with serious weaponry and armor for front-line combat, and so on.        None of these actions are particularly interesting. Resource management is a dull production-line affair where you shuffle goods from one space station to another to boost ship production. Combat, in both the campaign and the skirmish mode--which happens to be the only other way to play the game, as there is no multiplayer option--mainly involves band-selecting fleets and then right-clicking on enemies to start lasers blasting in scraps that are just as ridiculously drawn out (20 minutes to take out a few pirates? Really?) as the interminable between-mission dialogue. Most of the challenge comes from trying to figure out exactly what you're supposed to be doing when missions start, as there are few instructions given out after the initial orders are passed along on the main map/text screen. Combat missions often dump you blind into a system and leave you aimlessly flying around until you discover the ship you're supposed to escort, the enemies you need to exterminate, or whatever else. The only serious drama during battles is provided by the drum-thumping score. Even then, the pounding is so relentless that you'll soon want to turn off the music and enjoy the silent vacuum of space.     Worst of all, the 3D engine for space battles is just about meaningless. It doesn't add serious tactical considerations; you can essentially ignore the extra plane and click directly on enemies, space stations, and planets just as you would in a typical 2D RTS. If anything, it just gets in the way due to some annoying camera issues. For starters, everything moves all the time. Ships float randomly through space the moment that they leave space stations, which makes it tough to keep them in view. Locking the camera by left-clicking on an object like a planet or a moon helps somewhat when it comes to keeping an eye on an entire region of space, but even then every interstellar body is orbiting something else, so you still experience a lot of irritating ""Stop the world, I want to get off!"" moments. You can scroll way back to view an entire system at long range, but this turns ships into tiny dots and makes the game just as unmanageable as it is when you're looking at a close-up whirl of soaring vessels and rotating planets.     If you're in the mood for a 3D RTS in space, you might be better off heading to the mall and going spelunking in the bargain bin for an old copy of Homeworld. That almost decade-old classic remains a better bet than Shattered Suns.    "
4031,Without Warning,5.0,1," 24 is one of the most popular and innovative pieces of work currently on television today, so it's no surprise that video game clones of the 24 concept--a big, tense situation playing out via multiple perspectives over the course of a single 24-hour time period--would start to show up on the scene. 24 actually has its own game coming out next year, but the running start with the concept goes to Capcom and developer CiRCLE's Without Warning. The gimmick here? It takes place in a chemical plant overrun with terrorists, and spans a 12-hour period. The perspectives of six key characters are featured as well, causing the story to dart around quite a bit. But whereas in most cases when you tell a story from multiple character standpoints, that story and said characters are usually required to be interesting, Without Warning offers nothing of the sort. The plot is flat and painfully generic, the characters are terribly wooden rehashes of tired action game/movie clichés, and on top of all of that, the gameplay is about as dull as a game about shooting terrorists in the face can possibly get. So while Without Warning might have an interesting concept, it does next to nothing with it.        The plot description in the previous paragraph is just about as much story depth as you'll get from playing through the entire game. A terrorist group led by a French-Canadian mercenary has broken into a chemical plant on US soil, and plans to do something seriously evil with the chemicals housed in the facility. A military unit is sent in to take them out, and is subsequently gutted in a brutal attack. Only three soldiers, Kyle Rivers, Jack Hooper, and Ed Reagan, are left. In addition to them, three civilians are trapped onsite, including Dave Wilson, a plant security guard; Ben Harrison, a TV news cameraman that gets stuck in the plant when his news helicopter is shot down; and Tanya Shaw, a plant office secretary. Everyone's either trying to escape, or kill all the terrorists.      Throughout the course of the game, you play as each of these characters at one point or another, although you'll never grow to care about a single one of them. These characters are about as deep as an inflatable pool. One might argue that in an action game, you're not supposed to care about the characters as much as you are the action, but that's not so much the case here. Because of the whole shifting perspectives thing, you find yourself playing a lot of the same sequences over and over again, but with different characters. If the interactions, dialogue or situations were at all interesting, that repetition would be forgivable. But none of the three is in any way interesting. The story never transcends the basic ""Terrorists! Get 'em!"" kind of stuff that we've seen in hundreds of other shooters. The dialogue is cheesy and badly written, the voice acting is even worse--with actors apparently recording their first and only takes of their lines--and every single situation the game puts you in is just stupidly predictable, taking any measure of thrill or excitement out of the picture. Thus, you're left with a game design that feels terribly lazy and repetitious, thanks to poor execution of its somewhat ambitious premise.     Another problem is that Without Warning largely fails to make the act of shooting evil terrorists fun. The basic shooting mechanics are OK on paper, with a target-lock feature mapped to the left trigger button, and shooting to the right trigger. The problem is that when you shoot a bad guy, you never actually know what's going to happen. Sometimes you'll get lucky and pick off a guy from hundreds of feet away with a machine gun. And sometimes you'll have to shoot a guy three to four times with a shotgun at point-blank range to take him down. In fact, you're often better off trying to stay as far away as possible from any bad guys, as target locking enemies at relatively close distances causes the camera to snap around in a spastic fashion. It also doesn't help that each character is basically relegated to one weapon type. Whereas in just about any shooter in existence, you can pick up weapons of fallen enemies, this is not the case in Without Warning. It's arguable that the special-ops soldiers are probably fine with their automatic weapons, but when you're playing as a security guard with a weak pistol, you'd have to envision him eventually wanting to pick up a fallen AK-47 at some point.     Apart from weaponry, there isn't a lot of difference between most of the characters. All three of the soldiers and Dave the security guard handle roughly the same, apart from a few differentiating tasks assigned to each of them (Reagan is an explosives expert, so he diffuses a lot of bombs via some dull minigames, whereas Kyle has a sniper rifle as a bonus weapon, so he can pick off enemies from great distances). As for the secretary and the cameraman, their whole thing is ""no confrontation."" Ben's more interested in filming than shooting, and Tanya's just trying to get the hell out of dodge. The problem is that the story is paced out such that it takes hours to even get to the sections featuring Ben and Tanya; and when you do, you realize that it was all for naught, because trying to play stealthy in this game is the antithesis of fun, and in the off chance you do find yourself in combat, the weapons at your disposal aren't exactly good.     Again, not that the shooting is any better. Fighting off hordes of angry terrorists ought to be at least a viscerally pleasing experience, but it just falls flat, thanks to the limp weaponry and enemies that range from brain-dead to superhuman. Enemies are good at finding cover for the most part, but in some ways the game might have been better off without this bonus because it's already hard enough to take most enemies down. You'll actually be happy when the artificial intelligence randomly screws up and gets stuck running around in a circle or up against one environmental object or another--it'll make your life a lot less frustrating.      To make matters worse (or perhaps better, when you consider how frustrating the game can be), there's no element of surprise or unpredictability throughout any of the action. If you walk into a room, you will know where the bad guys are going to come from before they even step foot into your field of view. Any time there's a door leading to nowhere, a random corner that you haven't investigated, or any other sort of hiding place, you can expect terrorists to spawn there wantonly, because they will. Even better (or worse), the game practically waves a flag in your face to let you know enemies are coming via a significant drop in the frame rate every single time new enemies spawn. Between the weak shooting, predictable enemy spawning, and generally unimpressive AI, you're not going to have much fun playing this game.      The one thing that Without Warning has going for it is an entirely decent graphics engine. Given that it takes place inside a chemical plant, it's unsurprising that the environments would be styled in bland, industrial color tones, with lots of crates, barrels, and whatnot littering the areas. But for the most part, the game does a good job with all of these things. It may not be the most aesthetically pleasing environment, but all the different set pieces, breakable objects and environmental textures are nicely detailed. The character models, however, are a different story. The main characters are decently put together--despite the fact that their mouths never move during cutscenes--but the enemies are just plain ugly. They animate stiffly, barely react to getting shot (save for a few overwrought death animations) and upon close inspection, reveal horrid-looking facial maps and bodies. On top of all of this, there are the aforementioned camera and frame rate issues, ultimately negating a lot of the graphics' appeal.        The audio is mostly awful. As mentioned before, the voice actors used for these characters are beyond cheesy. Nobody sounds like they actually should, and every line is delivered with the kind of overly edgy intensity that would make Paul Walker blush. The terrorists occasionally mutter anti-American epithets and scream ""Kill the soldiers!"" in entirely indecipherable accents, but that's about it. There isn't a lot of music in the game, and what little is there doesn't make much of an impression. The sound effects are the lone standout, with some intense explosion and gunfire effects, but they aren't enough to salvage the audio presentation.     Without Warning can't be blamed for wanting to try something a little bit different than the average shooter--the problem is that the only thing it does differently isn't done very well, and the remaining components are so generic and hackneyed that they completely murder what small measure of originality the game has to offer. It's a dumb, frustrating, and boring game that clearly needed a lot more time in the pipes to become something entertaining, and it's not worth your time.  "
2568,Bullet Run,6.0,1,"   Star Trek episode where Spock and Bones were forced to fight each other with tridents and swords in front of the cameras in a modern Roman Empire, so it's not exactly the freshest backdrop for a shooter. But story was never going to be the strong point of a game like this, and the game-show vibe adds to the atmosphere, with booth jockeys hooting and hollering during every match.      There aren't any Damon Killian-styled barbs here, though, and the commentary is repetitive (you soon get very tired of hearing about ticket sales for Frag Fest and that you were nothing more than a speed bump after a kill), but the lines still add to the sense that you're in a digital take on The Running Man. Fans earned for match successes work as experience points, allowing you to level up. You also accumulate credits for kills and match victories that can be used to buy items (more on this below). Style is a huge part of the game. Play as the showman who wears groovy outfits, kills with flair, and then taunts the dead, and you gain fans and earn more loot.       The shooting action is respectably fluid. Running and gunning are engaging and draw you in, even while you recognize that the gameplay is about as innovative as the gladiator game-show setting. Still, this is an old-fashioned shooter done right. Weapons deliver a satisfying oomph, although some of the early weapons like the default MP5 are wimpy and inaccurate. Experienced first-person shooter gamers will settle right in to putting bullets in brains. Mouse movement for running, jumping, and targeting is slick and smooth. Match options are limited to Team Deathmatch and a control-point game called Dominion--standard options that offer fast-paced mayhem.      There isn't any originality in the half-dozen or so postapocalyptic settings, which include a ruined shantytown, a burning industrial zone, a run-down oil rig, an abandoned movie lot, and a crate-strewn warehouse, but they are smartly laid out. They come with nooks and crannies and choke points that reward those who think before they shoot, but the landscapes are packed tightly enough together that the fighting is always fast and furious. Everything looks pretty good, too, even if the fine detail is nowhere near what the Unreal engine used here is capable of producing today. The only serious issue with the maps is that there aren't enough of them. You can get bored after no more than a few hours of play because you're running over the same old ground, in the same old modes, again and again.       The lack of options in other areas is also more than a little bit frustrating. The free version of Bullet Run comes with precious few choices. You can barely customize your initial character's appearance, being allowed to make just a few free tweaks to hairstyle, shirt color, and the like. As a result, matches tend to look like battles of clones, with everyone in the same hair, face, and outfit. Taglines above characters make it easy to tell who's who, thankfully, although you can easily rip off a bunch of rounds at an ally in the same T-shirt and ponytail as about half of your enemies.        Weapons are just as limited. You start off with that aforementioned MP5 SMG, a pistol, and some frag grenades. Every other item in the game--and even stylistic things like special haircuts needed to boost your style value and increase your attraction to the fans--costs you in one or the other of the two featured in-game currencies. You pay for all goodies with either the points that are earned very, very slowly during gameplay or the Station Cash that can be acquired only with real-world money at a rate of $1 for 100.        As you might expect, the game constantly pushes you into spending real money. Everything is insanely expensive, particularly when it comes to the credits earned during play. You start off with a wallet filled with 10,000 credits, but that doesn't last long, and your impulse buys are further limited with level caps on a lot of hardware. Want an M1014 combat shotgun? It can be yours for a measly 899 in Station Cash ($8.99) or a whopping 35,999 credits. This is a pretty nifty weapon, mind you, which explains the high cost. But these rates are seen across the board. A Mohawk haircut to get you noticed on the tube is 179 in cash or 4,700 in credits. Clown face paint is 129 in cash or 3,100 in credits. Cargo pants are 129 in cash or 6,249 in credits.     Seeing as matches generally return no more than a thousand points, and often as little as a few hundred, you will be playing a very long time to make enough to pay for that shotgun noted above. Or anything else. As an additional insult, your weapons degrade quickly with use and cost a lot of credits to fix. So even if you decide to go the cheap route and grind your way to better guns and gear, all the credits that you save can easily wind up going toward keeping your existing equipment working properly and doing full damage. This pushes you to skip over all this nonsense and spend some real bucks…or ditch the game entirely. There are ways to speed up your in-game progress, but they all involve spending real money. Various boosters like PR managers and stock options increase fans and credits, but they can be accessed only through Station Cash purchases. The Platinum membership subscription model that costs $14.99 a month helps a lot. Sign up for the long haul, and you are provided with rewards like boosts to the credits earned in matches, sales on equipment, special taunts, and more.       In the end, if you want to be fully competitive in Bullet Run you need to invest an incredible amount of time in the game, spend at least $20 to $30 for a range of weapons and gear, or subscribe. You might well need to do all three if you get really into the game, since even subscribing just speeds up the credit-earning process and gives you price breaks. The game is playable with both the default free stuff and the affordable lower-tier weaponry, but just barely. You can compete a fair amount of the time, especially when you're playing with a team that works together and knows the maps. Still, it is beyond frustrating to fill a bad guy full of lead from your entry-level SMG only to see him whip around and kill you with a couple of squeezes of the trigger. You can't help but think you're missing out on something.      Getting murdered so efficiently provides constant temptation to throw down real-world cash for the better hardware. Getting blown away by a level 28 star wearing expensive face paint and wielding a combat shotgun that makes your MP5 look like a peashooter will do that to you. This happens a lot, too, because you are regularly dropped into games with vastly superior foes due to the absence of any rating or tiered system for matches.       Bullet Run is more of a brisk Bullet Walk. The core shooting mechanics at the heart of the game are done well enough to appeal to anyone looking for a simple, swift multiplayer shooter. You can get hooked for a good three or four hours on the free part of the game before growing bored with limitations like the lack of maps and modes. But the cash outlay required for this ostensibly free game is simply not justifiable, especially at a time when there are other good options out there that come with low initial price tags and do not hammer your willpower and credit card with the lure of buying success.     "
3632,"Casino, Inc.",5.0,1," Ever since RollerCoaster Tycoon's phenomenal success in 1999, PC game developers have sought to cash in on that game's popularity by following the same formula: developing modestly priced management strategy games that let players run a specific kind of themed business, such as a zoo or a shopping mall. British developer Hothouse Creations has tried its hand at this formula with Casino Inc., a game that lets you build and create your own Las Vegas-style casino business. While the game offers a number of surprisingly complex ways to manage your casinos, the complexity doesn't really add any depth, especially since the game's interface is clumsy and inadequate. As a result, Casino Inc. ends up being a game that's more complicated, and less fun, than it probably should have been.      In order to build up a successful business in Casino Inc., you'll need to bring in lots of different guests, including vacationers, high rollers, senior citizens, teens, and socialites. In order to accomplish this, you need to fill your casinos with exciting gambling games (such as blackjack, poker, roulette, and baccarat) staffed by experienced dealers, and you must also add amenities such as restaurants, bars, live shows, dance floors, and video arcades, in addition to decorations and fixtures like potted plants and cordon ropes to grab your guests' attention and keep them moving along the casino floor. In order to keep them coming into your casino, you'll need to provide your guests with transportation from the local train station.    You'll also need to hire a dedicated staff to man your gambling tables, serve food and drinks, screen out undesirables, clean up messes, repair your broken slot machines, and ""entertain"" your guests by serving as professional escorts. While you can hire highly experienced five-star staffers, these employees will generally cost much more money to employ, and all employees demand additional pay raises as they continue to work with you. You'll also need to keep an eye out for saboteurs that rival casinos will send to steal from your tables or beat up your guests, though if you can successfully capture them with your security staff, you can hire them on yourself. You'll also need to publicize your casino by advertising it prominently in various parts of the city. You'll also eventually need to expand your business both by building additional floors in your current operation, which can be used as either more casino space or as hotel rooms for weary guests, and also by buying up new buildings in other parts of town to use as completely new casinos.      If all this sounds complicated, it's because it is. And unfortunately, Casino Inc.'s interface isn't up to the challenge of helping you perform all these actions quickly and easily. The game's 3D camera is locked at four different zoom levels, only one of which is practically useful, and instead of being able to use your mouse to rotate the camera as you can in so many other 3D games, you can rotate your view and zoom in/out only by reaching for your keyboard and using the Insert, Delete, Home, End, and Page Up and Page Down keys. And nearly every one of Casino Inc.'s options is buried in a menu of tiny icons in all four corners of the screen that can be accessed only by clicking on the correct icon with your mouse pointer. Unlike in most management games, where you can build businesses by buying and placing fixtures, you can't even quickly and easily move or get rid of objects; you must open up a specific menu by clicking on a tiny icon, then click on the ""move"" or ""sell"" icon. So, you'll often find yourself in the odd position of switching between using only your keyboard to control the camera and only your mouse to open menus, rather than using both simultaneously as you may have become accustomed to with other PC games.    Because Casino Inc. buries so many important options in various menus, you'll rarely be able to react quickly to any important changes or events in your casinos. If an enemy saboteur starts a ruckus, your best bet is to immediately pause the game, scroll around until you can find the troublemaker, manually select a bouncer on your staff, then right-click on the troublemaker and choose to either beat him up (thereby converting him if the troublemaker is an honest-to-goodness saboteur) or kick him out of the joint, though thanks to the game's occasionally unreliable pathfinding, you may have to issue several orders to your bouncer before he complies. And unfortunately, since catching enemy saboteurs in the act is the only way to hire some of your own, you'll always need to drop everything to micromanage these events. You'll also need to pause everything to monitor your staff's ongoing (and ridiculous) salary demands. As you progress through most games and attempt to hire a large group of highly rated staffers, you'll find that no matter how often you give out pay raises and bonuses, there is always someone clamoring for a raise and threatening to walk out and leave your establishment understaffed.       Considering that Casino Inc. eventually lets you open and run several large casinos at once, you might expect it to be a large-scale strategy game that lets you, with good advance planning and occasional maintenance, sit back and watch the cash roll in as your casinos essentially run themselves (with occasional guidance). Unfortunately, because of important concerns like catching saboteurs, monitoring your staff's salary, and keeping on the good side of the cops, you'll need to constantly micromanage each casino, and you can't do this effectively with the game's clunky interface.   According to the game's manual and box, Casino Inc. lets you create a Las Vegas-style casino from the 1970s, though you wouldn't know that about the game by looking at it. Casino Inc.'s graphics are bright and colorful, and they don't look especially bad at all; the game's simple 3D graphics do a good job of creating the big cities in which your casinos are located, and they also do a decent enough job rendering onscreen characters. Both your staff and your guests are short, bigheaded, cartoonlike characters with exaggerated features, though your staff dresses in uniform, and your guests dress in straightforward suits, dresses, and T-shirts, and no one looks, acts, or sounds like they're from the '70s.   Casino Inc. doesn't sound like it's from the '70s--or from any other particularly exciting decade--either. The game's background music generally consists of soft, ambient techno tunes, unless you build a dance floor or theater in your casinos to provide music, in which case the game sounds like rather subdued Muzak versions of disco and jazz music. But you may not pay much attention to the music, since every game of Casino Inc. is punctuated by an almost continuous stream of voice samples, including your staffers greeting guests, your guests loudly proclaiming what they think, and the game's announcer frantically and constantly informing you that ""the staff are demanding a raise!"" You may find the strident comments of elderly guests, who are the loudest guests in the game for some reason, to be especially annoying when you hear four of them stammer, ""You're only as old as you feel,"" in unison for the hundredth time. You can set your doorman and bouncers to keep seniors out of your casino, but this setting doesn't actually work too well, even with the most highly ranked staffers money can buy.      The fact that this and other features don't actually work as they should doesn't really help Casino Inc., a game that already suffers from inconsistent sound and a problematic interface. Though Casino Inc. does occasionally let you feel like you are running a bustling casino, all too often, it interrupts the action with an important event that you'll have to micromanage, and you'll be reminded all over again of just how inadequate the game's interface is. Considering that the game has only a handful of single-player scenarios (though each is fairly long) and no free-form sandbox building mode, it seems unlikely that you'll be able to get much out of the game once you're finished with it.  "
3980,The Grinch,5.0,1,"Hot on the heels of the hit feature film, Universal Interactive and Konami have brought The Grinch to Sony's PlayStation game console. If you're not familiar with Dr. Seuss' tale, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, perhaps the best way to think of the Grinch is as the anti-Santa. Instead of delivering presents, he destroys them. Instead of decorating Christmas trees, he causes them to wilt. Standing in his way, however, are the happy residents of Whoville, a civilization of people whose sole mission in life is to celebrate holidays and bring cheer to the masses. As the Grinch, your job is to use your dastardly inventions to undo the Whos' holiday preparations once and for all. Unfortunately, after a few hours of play, it quickly becomes apparent that the only thing undone by the Grinch is your own personal satisfaction.   At the outset, The Grinch appears to be a decent game. It's a 3D platform game by nature, and your goal is to wander the land in search of blueprints so you can build your twisted inventions, while simultaneously ruining Whoville's Christmas celebration. There are four huge environments - Whoville, Whoforest, the Dumps, and Wholake - each with its own distinct features and goals. While acquiring the pieces to the Grinch's octopus climbing device in the dump, you'll also short-circuit the electrical system and poison the mayor's house with toxic gas. In all, there are 24 missions to complete, 3000 presents to destroy, and 68 blueprint swatches to collect. You can play as either the Grinch or his faithful dog, Max, swapping between the two with a quick tap of the select button. As the Grinch, you can run, jump, expel your rotten breath, and make use of an ever-increasing gadget collection that includes a rotten-egg launcher, a Grinch copter, and even a submarine. As Max, you can't do anything other than scamper about, but the little guy more than earns his keep by squeezing into areas the Grinch can't reach. Just don't let the Whos hug, sting, or trap you, or you'll begin to fill up the Grinch's exhaust-o-meter. Lose consciousness, and you'll find yourself back at the beginning of the level, but with your progress intact. Therein lies a hint of problems to come: You can't ultimately fail. Just like Nintendo's Wario, the Grinch is basically invincible, meaning that the game's missions have to compensate for an inherent lack of difficulty.   Once you're knee deep in The Grinch, three things become readily apparent: Missions are poorly designed, item dispersion is haphazard, and exploration is the antithesis of fun. Between destroying presents and sabotaging ski vacations, The Grinch faithfully adheres to Seuss' vision of the character, but since you're never really given any directions or hints on how to accomplish such tasks, the vision is quickly replaced by boredom. There's just no merriment in wandering around Whoville for hours searching for a cloak, only to find out it's hidden behind a rather generic-looking door. If the game's collecting and power-up aspects alleviated some of this torturous ennui, some leeway might be warranted. Unfortunately, you'll spend the majority of your time smashing presents, searching for tools, and hunting down blueprint segments - all of which are scattered about willy-nilly, as if no thought whatsoever went into designing the game's levels. Once in a while you'll have to perform Grinch gymnastics to reach a cleverly hidden power-up, but such instances of cool are few and far between. In light of all the game's disappointments, the least the game's designers could have done was make The Grinch's environments a joy to explore, but such isn't the case. Except for a few ingenious mountain-climbing expeditions in Whoforest, the rest of The Grinch's levels are plain enclosures stuffed with repetitive scenery, cookie-cutter enemies, and recurring obstacles. It's as if half of the development team set out to design a gleeful kids' game, while the remainder sought to produce the most mentally taxing puzzle game ever created. As a whole, the equation fails miserably.  In the dog-eat-dog world of children's games, developers can compensate for problematic gameplay with charming visuals. On a static level, The Grinch seems pleasant, but a number of harsh realities come to bear once you actually start moving. First, the draw-in plane is too close. Nearby structures are vibrant and full of detail, but those off in the distance lack texture and definition. It's a great way to maintain a solid frame rate but a horrible way to design an adventure game - especially since half of the game's puzzles involve seeking out structural landmarks. Once you get used to the scenery popping up like a David Copperfield magic trick, you've got to acclimate yourself to some rather brutal slowdown. Everything is fine when the Grinch is the only character on the screen, but as soon as another polygonal character or object appears, the game chugs horribly. Seeing Whoville brought to life is a heartwarming experience, provided you don't move. On the bright side, the game's soundtrack and voice acting make a respectful attempt to mimic the attitude of the feature film, even if the rest of the presentation falls flat.   It's hard to believe that this is what Universal Interactive and Konami had in mind when envisioning the Grinch, a poorly animated game that's far too complex and tedious for its intended audience. As Dr. Seuss, may he rest in peace, would say: The game's been Grinched.   "
1071,F1 2017,9.0,2,"The bread and butter of the Codemasters F1 games has long been the career mode, which lets you create your own driver and guide them through their racing career, and F1 2017’s is no different. Aesthetically it’s been buffed out and expanded, adding new animations and team interactions, and showing off more of the infamous F1 paddock all while adding a grander sense to the occasion. For a series that had nailed the atmosphere of a Grand Prix some years ago, these additions add another layer that’s easy to appreciate.The new upgrade system is another step up from last year, allowing you to focus your team's R&amp;D efforts on new parts in four key areas--chassis, aerodynamics, powertrain and durability. Where you decide to focus your points largely depends on who you drive for. Go with a team like McLaren and you’ll need to focus heavily on improving the woeful Honda power unit. Whereas for a top tier team like Red Bull or Ferrari, you might be more methodical about how you spend your resource points, focusing instead on areas you might be slightly weaker than your competitors. F1 2017 improves on past entries by being the most transparent entry in the series, giving you more than enough information to directly compare performance to your rivals.Resource points are earned over the course of a race weekend by meeting your team’s set qualifying and race objectives, as well as completing the practice programmes the team lays out for you in any given practice session. In addition to providing resource points for upgrades, the practice programmes also act as elaborate tutorials, teaching the finer arts of driving a modern Formula One beyond the basics of ‘the racing line’. More complex techniques like fuel and tyre management and determining race strategy are broken down into easily digestible chunks of information, making it easier for new fans to dig into what makes a race weekend so involved.This level of strategizing extends to the car too, both in and out of the garage. F1 2017 tracks the wear and tear on each component of the engine and the gearbox, in line with real life rules to keep costs down for the smaller teams. Parts aren’t limited, but using more than your allotted amount will result in a grid drop penalty for each infringement. This means having to make tough but meaningful choices about whether to risk running worn parts for a race--leading to greatly reduced power or a possible outright failure--or taking the penalty and hoping you can fight your way back through the field.When it comes to the look of the cars, they’re nothing short of exquisite. Each of the ten teams and their magnificent machines are modelled down to the finest details, with their sleek carbon-fibre bodywork lusciously reflecting the world around them. Likewise, the circuits themselves also show off the game’s excellent lighting and dynamic weather, which makes a return from previous games. The rare occasions where high-res textures take a moment to load in are a minor blemish on what is an otherwise stunning looking title.Equally excellent is the feel behind the wheel. Be it with a wheel--which is absolutely the recommended way to play--or a gamepad, the cars feel as responsive as you'd hope. There is still more than enough power to make the back end slide out from under you, but unlike before, the wider tyres and extra downforce mean you can brake later, turn in harder, and get on the power earlier than ever before.This is starkly reflected on track in the different handling and power of each car. Driving the McLaren-Honda down a long straight is nothing short of harrowing; other cars will power past you like you’re sitting still, forcing you to get your elbows out when trying to defend your position. On the other hand, both the Mercedes and Ferrari feel planted to the road straight out of the garage. The robust physics engine is backed up by some of the best racing AI in the business, who will fight hard for position and make mistakes, but also offer up plenty of racing room if you do manage to get a wheel alongside them.The V10 roar of the 2002 Ferrari compared to the throaty growl of an old turbo-powered McLaren is enough to smack any nostalgic fan into bliss.The inclusion of classic cars represents some of the best F1 machines from the last 30 years. From Senna’s 1988 McLaren to Vettel’s 2010 Red Bull, there are 12 cars in total, each of them a world championship winning car from their era. They wonderfully showcase the progression of the sport over the years, and the V10 roar of the 2002 Ferrari compared to the throaty growl of an old turbo-powered McLaren is enough to smack any nostalgic fan into bliss.Jumping online to race with others is easier than previous years, doing away with the hoppers of old, opting for a more elegant approach. You choose your preference between shorter or longer races, get into a lobby and go. Also back is the online championship, letting you and your most dedicated friends battle it out over an entire season, with or without AI.Time Trials let you race against the leaderboards in any car, modern or classic, in any set of weather conditions. Events are a new feature for F1 2017, offering one-off, downloadable scenarios that drop you straight into the action then comparing your results to others via leaderboards when you’re done. Codemasters have left no wannabe racer wanting with the myriad ways to drive these cars.Any gripes cast against F1 2017 are minor. Instant replays could last a bit longer, and the simulation damage model could be more detailed and less forgiving. But this list pales in comparison to what Codemasters have delivered, an F1 game that can truly cater for everyone--from sim racers to the newest casual fan.Codemasters has been on a roll with its F1 series for a number of years now, and F1 2017 feels like the culmination of those years of work. Where F1 2016 lacked a little on the career side, F1 2017 more than makes up for that and then some more. An improved multiplayer set up, a greater variety of race options and straight-up better cars to drive, on top of the stellar career mode and thrilling on track racing experience make F1 2017 simply the best Formula One game ever made."
2073,Pandora: First Contact,4.0,0,"Alpha Centauri. While it is meant to be a respectful tribute, Pandora is laden with awful design choices and a confusing mishmash of old and new mechanics. The pieces that stand up are pulled directly from other, better games, and the original ideas aren't developed well enough to carry the experience. Pandora: First Contact opens with a smattering of people desperate to find a new Earth after decades of environmental destruction. The most prosperous societies have each launched their own expeditions, loosely representative of several modern-day nations and ideologies. These groups form the different factions and have their own vaguely defined play styles ranging from brutal, polluting industry to hyper-religious zealotry. Unfortunately, while they are thematically distinct, none of the factions stand out. Besides how the diplomatic options are phrased, and a few starting bonuses, they are all more or less the same. In my games, playing as the super-scientific faction wasn't terribly different from playing as the environmentalists. All of the units are the same, and the victory conditions are far too limited for any of your decisions to have much of an effect. There really is only one correct play style: extreme aggression. Civilization has often been lauded for allowing you to seek scientific, cultural, military, or even diplomatic victory, and each of these routes is supported by an entire system of mechanics that help support that path. These systems connect with one another and can be attached or separated, giving you an enormous amount of freedom in how you play. Those choices are meaningful because they are symbolic; they represent different and distinct ideologies. Pandora, too, has ""different"" victory conditions, but none of them are well developed. There is a scientific victory that amounts to having 75 percent of all possible research items complete. To achieve military victory, you have to take control of over 75 percent of the planet's populace. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which you accomplish these conditions are nearly identical, and there's virtually no way to stop a player who's nearing victory. The element of choice and the ability to consistently have any efficacy or agency in the game is totally subverted by this design. The planet of Pandora is crawling with aliens when you first touch down, and it takes only a few turns for those forces to turn aggressive; unlike the barbarians from Civilization, these creatures are absolutely everywhere and are much, much stronger than any of your starting units. For example, a unit of marines has a starting combat strength of 2, while aliens range from 1 to 18, with 2 and 8 being the most common. How well you handle these early foes determines how much land and resources you have to work with in the mid to late game. While it is meant to be a respectful tribute, Pandora is laden with awful design choices and a confusing mishmash of old and new mechanics. Sadly, ignoring them isn't an option. Even if you never attack the aliens or show any sign of aggression, at a certain point they begin attacking you. Expanding and fortifying your armies, and then raiding alien hives for their massive cash reserves is the only way to play. Any land you don't grab for yourself is land a future opponent will use against you, and any aliens you don't kill feed the resources and experience of your rivals. This design choice forces the game into a two-stage system. The first stage is rapid expansion and extreme brutality against the indigenous aliens, and the second stage is focused more on developing the land you've claimed and steadily pushing back against enemies. While the first stage might be frustratingly limited, the second is fundamentally broken. In better-designed 4X games, much of the mid- to late-game conflict stems from resource scarcity. You need a specific plot of land that an opponent has; this causes conflict, which then buttresses the final stages of a match. In Pandora, land is certainly important, but expansion is agonizingly slow. Even on the fastest setting, with the exception of a handful of rare tiles, there's absolutely no scarcity. Aside from mountains, just about every tile can be converted into every other kind, and they don't carry the bottlenecking effect that's common in other games. Without scarcity, there's very little to fight over, and the monotony of expansion across hundreds of same-y tiles wears down to tedium very quickly. In place of a varied and interesting landscape, Pandora has a fairly robust unit upgrade and operations system. As you progress technologically, you have access to a wider variety of weapons and equipment for your various units. For example, initially your legions of marines only have access to their basic machine guns, but once you develop the flamethrower, you can bring marines back to a city to refit them with the latest gadgets. This is typically done for a significant cost, though, and can become overwhelmingly expensive when upgrading masses of units. Additionally, at each new stage of technological development, you also gain access to advanced versions of every unit. The colonial marine, your bread and butter, later becomes the assault trooper. After you've unlocked the next stage, it's often more practical to simply send your old units to their death at the hands of a foe and just start production on the next batch of souped-up soldiers To cut down on some of the banality of this cycle of production-upgrade-sacrifice, you can set your cities to crank out new units with the upgraded tech. This costs extra production time, but typically that's much easier to manage than trying to purchase all of the upgrades outright. Unfortunately, there's no system or mechanic allowing for the retrofitting of old units with new gear via production capacity, nor is there any way to take an old unit and make it into one of the newer variety. This is probably intended to be balanced by the experience system, which can dramatically enhance the combat effectiveness of older troops, but that loses relevance in the mid to late game because of operations. Without scarcity, there's very little to fight over. Operations can range from nuclear strikes and satellite scans to field training missions. They are produced much like standard units but are immediately consumed upon use. These field training missions are ridiculously cheap, particularly in the late game, and I often had one city of mine constantly producing them. After I finished a new batch of troops, I'd march them all to my most forward base, dump 10 field training missions on them to max out their level, and then let them heal up for two or three turns before marching out my legions of tanks, airplanes, and marines to conquer whatever stood in their way. It's much faster and less risky than trying to naturally level up fresh recruits, and it always ensured that my warriors would be at the top of their game. At the end of the day, unit management is bogged down by a plethora of underutilized mechanics. Instead of adding to the gameplay, they simply encourage you to abuse other systems to circumvent the poorly designed interface. That seems to be par for the course for Pandora. There are a lot of neat ideas here, but none of them pan out. The game's creators clearly adore 4X strategy games in general, and Alpha Centauri specifically, is clear here, but Pandora: First Contact is not a proper tribute. I want to love Pandora, I really do, but nostalgia can't fix a game that doesn't work even at the most basic level."
1264,Until Dawn: Rush of Blood,5.0,1,"With a PlayStation Move controller in each hand--simulating two guns--and a PlayStation VR headset on your noggin, your primary task is to keep an eye out for bad guys that either run directly at you or throw objects from the safety of cover. Aim, fire, and reload as quickly as you can, or you might end up dying from a few unfortunate hits. Should you die, you respawn in close proximity--the one exception is the ""Insane"" difficulty setting, which forces you to restart a level when you die. If you don't have Move controllers, you can play with a DualShock 4 alone, but it causes your two guns to move in unison, which dramatically detracts from the shooting-gallery appeal while also limiting your capabilities in practice.Levels include gruesome warehouses filled with squealing, dismembered pig carcasses, a haunted mental hospital with ghastly figures that dart in and out of sight, and a run-down carnival with sections of spooky woodlands. The game includes seven levels in total, but they tend to bleed together; Until Blood is fairly consistent in the tone and atmosphere of its settings, up until the vastly different final level that veers into the fiery depths of hell. They're dreadful, occasionally gross, and last about 10 to 15 minutes apiece.As you trundle through shadows and murky frights, you're accosted by the usual cast of horror baddies: thugs in clown masks, animated mannequins, zombie-like fiends, and spiders--arachnophobes, beware. With decent motion tracking in effect, aiming your shots comes naturally after a few minutes, and you quickly learn how to react to threats in front of you and in your peripheral vision. During some scenes, you must frantically react to succeed, but a keen eye and a calm disposition is all that's required once you understand the relationship between the PS Move controller and your virtual guns. You can temporarily acquire a small selection of powerful weapons hidden in colorful boxes, but they only prove necessary during the game's final encounter and otherwise serve as a way to add much-needed variety.Most enemies follow routines and are generally easy to kill--bad guys afar pop in and out of cover, and incoming foes simply sidle up to your cart if you don't shoot them right away, making for truly easy targets. There's one ghastly miniboss that sprints to and fro, making it difficult to hit from a distance, but all you have to do is wait for it to get in your face, fire a couple of rounds into it, and repeat the process until she's dust.Rush of Blood's other threats come in the form of obstacles that intrude upon your personal space. To avoid them, you simply need to lean to one side--or duck. Granted, the cart moves quickly during some sequences, and you have to react accordingly, but you typically have plenty of warning, since the cart moves slow and steady. Obstacles in Rush of Blood feel like nothing more than filler; they aren't scary, and they don't pose a meaningful threat.Should you choose to play for a place on Rush of Blood's online leaderboards, every level is packed with otherwise inconsequential props that you can shoot for bonus points, denoted by red-white-and-blue target decals. These make for decent target practice while you're waiting for the next action set piece, but again, they’ll mean everything or nothing depending upon your desire to replay levels and outdo other players' scores.Rush of Blood can be completed in roughly an hour and a half, and though you can unlock a few alternate paths in a couple of levels, they generally lead to more of the same--just in a different arrangement. Rush of Blood has a disturbing flavor overall, but that alone can't save what amounts to a largely predictable experience filled with straightforward action, dumb enemies, and predictable frights."
4101,Happy Tree Friends: False Alarm,4.0,0,"  Happy Tree Friends False Alarm is a side-scrolling puzzle game available on Xbox Live Arcade that requires players to safely guide a group of the overly cute Happy Tree Friends past levels filled with various environmental dangers. Although the Flash cartoon series found plenty of fans thanks to the imaginatively over-the-top violence it perpetrated on its characters, this game won't win many plaudits thanks to its unimaginative level design, poor AI, and clunky controls.      Even diehard fans of the cartoon series may find this one tough to like, because instead of reveling in the insane amounts of violence and dismemberment that the titular woodland creatures go through in an average Flash episode, False Alarm tasks you with making sure that the friends avoid as much harm as possible as they traverse through 30 danger-filled levels. The basic gameplay structure is lifted straight from Lemmings; Happy Tree Friends characters Flippy, Flaky, Mole, Russell, and Nutty will blithely wander through a level, and it's up to you to make sure that they don't fall victim to the many traps and hazards along the way. At your disposal are four abilities: nitro will blow apart certain obstacles; fire will melt ice and make the friends run; ice will cover holes as well as freeze a friend in place; and the action ability is used to turn levers, press buttons, and more. Each of these abilities is mapped to one of the Xbox 360's four face buttons, and the left and right triggers are used to move along a level.        Problems beset False Alarm from the get-go, given that the controls--particularly when you need to move the screen left or right to identify upcoming obstacles--are quite sluggish. Using the four abilities can also be quite frustrating because they sometimes don't respond unless your cursor is practically placed pixel perfect over the object that you're trying to affect (for example, some of the ice shards in the later levels). The friends themselves can exhibit some poor AI, and will often get stuck behind some pieces of the environment for no apparent reason (forcing you to restart a level).     The game is also rather short, and you'll probably be able to blitz through the available 30 levels in an hour or two. Part of the reason it goes so quickly is that False Alarm's levels are blisteringly easy for the most part. Their unimaginative design means that you'll never have to think too hard about how a particular puzzle is solved. False Alarm does reward you with gold, silver, or bronze medals depending on how quickly you complete a level, but there's little other incentive to come back for more.     False Alarm's graphics mimic the simple, clean, and colorful look of the animated series. The characters themselves are quite basic, but they do sport some appropriately gory injuries should you be careless enough to let them wander too close to hazards (exposed brains through cracked skulls are a highlight). The game's music also mimics the show's cheery theme tune, which is to say that it's upbeat and thoroughly annoying in equal measures. And as an added bonus, the game features a new Happy Tree Friends episode featuring candy addict Nutty ditching the sweet stuff and becoming hooked on video games instead.     Underneath all of its bad points, there is a sliver of fun to be had with Happy Tree Friends False Alarm, particularly if you forgo the whole point of the game and just let the grinning friends meet their bloody end on the various obstacles that you'll come across. Unfortunately, with the game costing 800 Microsoft points, that sliver of fun isn't enough to earn this game a recommendation.    "
1026,The Mummy Demastered,7.0,2,"The Mummy is, at heart, a mixture of Ghosts n' Goblins and Metroid. It looks and plays as if it would be perfectly at home on the Super Nintendo, and everything about it will feel instantly familiar to anyone who's played their fair share of 16-bit side-scrolling action games. There's one giant map where new sections are opened by either finding new abilities and items or defeating bosses. Monsters immediately respawn as soon as you enter a new room or area and secret treasures encourage exploration.Supply boxes are scattered throughout the world containing everything from an assortment of new weapons to health upgrades. Weapons include machine guns, a flame thrower, shotgun, rocket launcher, and more, including several types of grenades, ranging from standard explosive to fiery napalm. The Mummy also features destructible statues containing secret scrolls to grant you extra speed, higher jumps, and other necessary skills to reach new areas. It's a tried-and-true method of progression that keeps you searching every passage, and there's enough variety in the locations and room designs to keep the familiar gameplay from feeling stale.The most notable aspect--for better or worse--is the way The Mummy treats death, which takes inspiration from WayForward's DS action game, Aliens: Infestation. When you die in The Mummy, your character turns into a zombie and you take control of a new agent. In order to retrieve all the goodies you've collected, you have to successfully kill the ghost of your former self. This is a great idea that fits in at first but becomes incredibly tedious during tough boss battles. Since you respawn in a save room prior to a boss battle, dying leads to an annoying series of events requiring you to kill the last agent, then go and kill a bunch of lesser monsters to regain health, before trying again to take down the boss. There's no option to simply revert to your last save file.It's also a very tough game in general, ghost agents notwithstanding. Enemies constantly come at you from multiple angles, there are environmental hazards like toxic waste, and difficult bosses relentlessly test your shooting and dodging skills. All of these moments feel great in action, but the limited eight-way directional aiming is an occasional annoyance. Since you frequently have to shoot things at angles above and below you, the lack of finesse here requires constant position adjustments. It would have helped the combat flow to take advantage of modern analog controls and allow for a full range of motion when aiming.Quibbles aside, The Mummy delivers a creative and action-packed adventure. Full of running, jumping, and gunning through tombs, forests, sewers, subway tunnels, and beyond, the game brims with challenging old-school charm. It's sure to bring back a flood of nostalgia, while still managing to be a solid game on its own. Still, a few more modern touches to make it slightly more playable wouldn't have hurt. As it is though, this is a fun and tough monster-filled trek that surpasses the license it's attached to."
4483,Inuyasha: Secret of the Divine Jewel,4.0,0,"  It doesn't matter whether you follow the Inuyasha animated series or are merely looking for a role-playing game to play on your Nintendo DS--either way, you're liable to be disappointed by Inuyasha: Secret of the Divine Jewel. The game is a simplistic dungeon crawler that draws hardly any inspiration from the show it's based on. Nothing is fleshed out, the turn-based combat lacks excitement, and the whole quest would barely last a few hours if not for the excessive encounter rate that makes it impossible to walk more than a couple of steps before participating in yet another mindless battle.         Previous knowledge of the animated series isn't required to play the game or to understand its story. The game recaps the basic plot of the TV series through comments in the dialogue, and all of the major characters are introduced in such a way that you'll quickly pick up on their overall roles. In the game, a new character named Janis has transferred to Kagome's school in modern-day Tokyo. Janis and Kagome strike up a friendship, and a series of coincidences leads to Janis discovering the magical well behind Kagome's house. Janis climbs into the well and follows Kagome back to feudal Japan, where she accidentally absorbs one of the pieces of the Shikomi jewel that Inuyasha and Kagome have been searching for into her body. Consequently, Janis discovers that she's the reincarnation of a powerful god. As a result of these events, Janis vows to seek out a specific demon that holds the secrets of her past, while the half-human, half-demon Inuyasha volunteers his group to accompany Janis on her journey in the hope that they'll eventually be able to retrieve the Shikomi shard that's been absorbed into her body. It isn't the most intelligent story ever concocted, but it does sufficiently explain why you'll spend the rest of the game hauling a party of six characters across feudal Japan and constantly engaging in turn-based battles with various demonic creatures.     The game itself is a primitive Final Fantasy wannabe that mainly involves slogging through one random battle after another as you walk between villages and struggle to find your way out of mazelike dungeons. Exploration is kept to a minimum. Characters always tell you where to go next, and most dungeons require you to locate only a single key item in order to unlock the exit. Character development is also rather limited. You have access to all of their magic abilities from the beginning, so the outcome of grinding levels is merely that their strength, defense, and health statistics gradually improve. You can't change their weapons or clothing. In fact, the only pieces of equipment you can change are the orbs and amulets the characters carry, which you can't do until midway through the story mode. Nearly all of the interactions you have with the game occur during the turn-based battles that are initiated on a random basis as you move across the map. Characters have a good selection of close-up, ranged, and group attacks, and you can command multiple characters to attack a single enemy or to defend one of your own heroes. Battles tend to be boring and one-sided, however. Common enemies use the same attacks and don't dish out much damage. You also usually get to attack with three or four of your party members before a single member of the enemy group has a chance to reciprocate. Often, you'll be pulled into a battle only to end up back at the map screen 20 seconds later because you eliminated the enemy group before any of its members had an opportunity to do anything.     Those boring battles are made all the more plentiful (and painful) thanks to the game's high encounter rate. In typical role-playing games that feature random battles, you're pulled into a fight perhaps every 20 steps or so. In Inuyasha, a battle is initiated every four steps on average. Occasionally, you'll come out of one battle and end up in another immediately after taking just a single step. That's excessive. It's difficult to learn the layout of an area when the screen transitions from the map to the battlefield every few seconds, and it's no fun to be forced to fight fodder enemies long after you've built up the necessary stats to trounce the next boss. If the encounter rate in Inuyasha were like that of other role-playing games, you could get through the story in roughly five hours. Instead, the encounter rate is so jacked up that it takes more like 20 hours to finish the game. Sadly, most of that time is spent eradicating cookie-cutter enemies that never get a chance to fight back.     On top of everything else, the overall presentation is lackluster. Allusions to the animated series are limited mainly to the characters' attacks, which are all directly lifted from the TV show, along with a few bits of throwaway dialogue that reference past situations the characters have experienced. The gameplay barely draws any inspiration from the show. Movement, combat, and items are handled the same way as in every other generic role-playing game. The only noteworthy exceptions are that Inuyasha becomes human and you can't use his magic when the moon-phase clock shows a new moon. Furthermore, the graphics and audio suggest that the game may have been a Game Boy Advance game that was revamped for the Nintendo DS late in its development cycle. The 2D backgrounds and tiny character sprites are colorful, but there's not much in the way of animation or visual effects. On the map screen, the characters walk like robots, and the only life you'll notice in the environment are cloud shadows and the occasional stream. In the battle viewpoint, most attacks consist of two or three frames of animation, tops. Magic use is accompanied by a brief video sequence shown on the top screen. Those snippets are snazzy, but they're nothing the GBA couldn't handle.         Incredibly, the developer didn't bother to record any character speech from the show. Audio consists of a few low-fidelity clash and explosion noises, as well as about a dozen superbly orchestrated pieces of music. Movement and menu selections can be handled with the stylus or the buttons, so there's really no reason that this game couldn't have been released on the Game Boy Advance, apart from the fact that the Nintendo DS is the more popular system these days.     Fans and nonfans alike should steer clear of Inuyasha: Secret of the Divine Jewel for the Nintendo DS. The only thing the game has going for it is the Inuyasha license. Otherwise, it's just a crummy Final Fantasy knockoff with weak visuals and audio that requires only 20 hours to play through because of its ridiculously high encounter rate.  "
4321,Delta Force: Task Force Dagger,4.0,0,"  While Red Storm Entertainment's Rainbow Six series often gets all the credit for establishing the tactical shooter genre, games like NovaLogic's long-running Delta Force series deserve some credit too. With a focus on real-world weaponry, long-range sniping, and quick kills, the early Delta Force games helped create a new level of realism in shooters. Nevertheless, the Delta Force series has since been left limping along the gaming wayside, surpassed by superior tactical shooters like SWAT 3, Operation Flashpoint, and Ghost Recon. NovaLogic's latest release, Delta Force: Task Force Dagger, simply can't compare with these games and marks a real step backward for the Delta Force series.  It may sound like doublespeak, but NovaLogic is billing Task Force Dagger as a ""stand-alone mission pack"" for 2000's once-decent but now-dated Delta Force: Land Warrior. This seeming contradiction means you'll get the same fundamental game engine featured in Land Warrior, but with 25 new missions and a bunch of new weapons. Unfortunately, none of them are particularly entertaining.    In Task Force Dagger, you head to Afghanistan to fight in missions inspired by Operation Enduring Freedom--which may suggest to some that NovaLogic is simply trying to profit from tragic real-world events. NovaLogic touts the game as a tribute to the heroes of the conflict, but Task Force Dagger simply treats the subject matter with cold, boring sterility. As far as story and setting go, it's one of the most uninvolving tactical shooters in a long time.    In Task Force Dagger, you'll head to places like Kandahar, where you'll destroy SAM sites. In Mazar-e Sharif, you'll try to capture an enemy commander. In Bagh-e Daud, you'll try to rescue a journalist. Despite this seeming variety, many missions play the same: Approach a compound, snipe a bunch of guys who are just standing around, move in, blast a few remaining guys who are just standing around, and grab some documents or blow something up. The fact that you do most of these things without any AI companions is both dull and unrealistic. As for multiplayer, it's decent enough for a short spell but ultimately just the same sort of thing you've played many times before: capture the flag, king of the hill, deathmatch, and the like.    Delta Force: Land Warrior is probably most remembered for its atrocious enemy AI. The utter ineptitude of your opponents often made the game feel more like a glorified shooting gallery than a true tactical shooter. Task Force Dagger offers little, if any, improvement to the AI. If the enemy beats you, it's only because they grossly outnumber you. They're brainless pushovers who yell out for no reason, only drawing attention to themselves, or who stand motionless when you shoot one of their buddies in the same room.    You'll get to ""fight"" these enemies as one of 10 different Special Forces groups, like the US Green Berets or the British SAS. Each force has special abilities, like enhanced swimming (not exactly in demand in the mountains of Afghanistan) or the ability to withstand more damage (apparently Marines have thicker skin). Each group also has its preferred weapons, though how exactly these preferences affect gameplay is never made clear, since it's easy enough to hit targets with any weapon.    The overall selection of weapons in Task Force Dagger is enough to make a firearms fanatic giddy--at first. You'll get an alphabet soup of killing machines, including the cutting-edge OICW combination assault rifle/grenade launcher. Then there are the M24 and PSG-1 sniper rifles, the M249 SAW, and the M16A2 assault rifle with 40mm grenade launcher, among others. You'll also get plenty of secondary weapons like the HK MP5SD6 submachine gun, the SOCOM pistol, and the LAW antitank weapon. You'll even get to call in air strikes in some missions. An interesting nonlethal tool at your disposal is live, overhead video footage of the mission area from unmanned aerial vehicles.    With an admirable nod to realism and player preference, Task Force Dagger offers toggles for crosshair spread, scope drift, recoil, and even the effect of wind on ballistics. Unfortunately, the way the game handles weapons isn't quite as admirable. Task Force Dagger gives you so many firearms that it becomes difficult to even tell the difference between them. It would probably have been better to offer fewer weapons and more strongly emphasize their tactical differences. Also, the game gives you precious little control over throwing grenades, and you can literally switch weapons instantly--an astounding trick that real soldiers would surely love to learn. What's even more ridiculous is that bombs from air strikes explode with about the same force as a grenade. An explosion right near a guard tower will leave both tower and guard miraculously unscathed.    On top of that, the game's physics suffer from a severe lack of realism. You can fall great distances without so much as a sprained ankle, and when you jump, you seem to actually float through the air. When prone, you can casually and quickly move sideways for hundreds of yards without getting fatigued.  Task Force Dagger features the same core graphics engine found in Delta Force: Land Warrior. This means that you're going to get a game with some dated, problematic visuals. On the bright side, the engine can render sprawling outdoor levels. Then again, the game's textures appear simple and boring, generic buildings tend to be inexplicably devoid of furnishings, explosions can look downright silly, and the terrain shimmers like mad whenever you move.     The audio won't win any prizes, either. When you fire a gun outdoors, it sounds like you're shooting inside a cave. Enemy voices carry too far and too clearly, and the commander who briefs you at the beginning of each mission sounds oddly bored--maybe he just finished playing this game.    Delta Force: Task Force Dagger offers one or two vaguely entertaining features, like aerial reconnaissance, but in the end these things are buried under the weight of the game's many disappointing traits."
3770,Original War,5.0,1,"It would be easy to write a review of Original War--one that used its tremendous misnomer of a title as the launching point for an urbane, New Yorker-esque critique of time travel and gorillas, which unfortunately is too often what passes for game criticism these days. It would be much harder--but still easy--to criticize the game's dated graphics, simplistic gameplay, incredibly bad voice acting, and nonsensical plot. In fact, criticizing any given element of Original War seems gratuitous, since taken separately, these elements are almost parodies of themselves. The game's plot is silly and further undermined by its atrocious sound, the gameplay makes Red Alert 2 seem like a complex strategy game, and the graphics can cause you to lead your units into a dead end that seems like a gully but is actually a cliff. Despite these nominal problems, you can actually find yourself getting caught up in the game. Not for long, mind you, but it can happen.   From all appearances, Original War is very similar to Fallout Tactics, except for the fact that it's really nothing like Fallout Tactics. While both games are played in real time, involve characters whose skills increase with experience, and make you fight through linked episodes of a really bad story as might be seen in comic books, Fallout Tactics plays at least nominally like a role-playing game. Original War, on the other hand, is almost in all respects a real-time strategy game from 1995.   The game's plot involves going back in time and mining some kind of future miracle substance in Siberia and then reburying it in Alaska so that the good guys control it when the time to discover its magical properties happens. Since mining simulations haven't exactly had much of an impact on gaming, a bunch of time-traveling Russians show up to make Original War a member of that much better-received genre of games, the simulation of blowing things up.   In one of those twists that game developers used to shock gamers back in 1990, Original War actually combines elements of several genres, to the extent that naming your units automatically makes something a role-playing game. These units can gain experience in four classes--soldier, mechanic, engineer, and scientist--and once they have been killed, they are lost forever. This leads to a lot of saving and reloading, since units die very quickly.    Characters actually possess levels in each of these specializations, and you can switch between specializations at various times by entering a specific building that functions as a sort of changing room. Apparently, Original War's designers figured that if they couldn't make something original, they could at least make it incredibly cumbersome so that players feel like they're accomplishing something: only mechanics can drive vehicles, only soldiers can fire weapons, only scientists can heal, and only engineers can construct buildings and collect supplies. Thus, even if one of your characters has a high skill in some area, if he hasn't been specifically designated as a certain class, he cannot perform that class' functions. This leads to such contrivances as the need to construct an armory at the end of each mission, in which you didn't otherwise need one, simply to change all your characters into soldiers so that they can actually fight.   Original War's graphics and sound aren't just bad, but they're also confusing. The game's voice acting is bad in two ways: first, it's just plain bad, and second, many of the unit acknowledgements don't actually match the voices that particular character uses in dialogue. Furthermore, the cartoon heads that appear when a character speaks compare unfavorably, from an aesthetic standpoint, to portraits in role-playing games circa 1993. The rest of the game's graphics have the hand-painted look of Baldur's Gate, which not only places them squarely in 1998 but also makes them very confusing to navigate. While the game supposedly takes place in the Pliocene Epoch, it doesn't feel much different from any other computer game setting, except for the occasional saber-toothed tiger or apeman.  The single-player game can be started as either the Americans or the Russians, but the full campaign (and story) consists of playing through the American missions and then the Russian ones. While the story is mostly linear, there are branching points where you can make decisions that determine the progress of the plot. Unfortunately, these decisions are mixed in with ones that simply lead you to have to restart the mission, because they are dead ends. There is actually a third side (the Arabs) that enters the plot, but the action takes place mainly between the Russians and Americans.   Original War's actual gameplay greatly resembles a fidgety version of Command &amp; Conquer. While real-time strategy games have generally advanced far beyond 1995, Original War has actually regressed. Units are hard to control and tend to wander around even when they have no orders (which often leads them to get killed by the enemy you were specifically trying to stay away from). There is a ""stand ground"" order, but it is canceled as soon as you move the unit. The game's pathfinding and general unit AI are awful--they destroy any kind of atmosphere the game tries to create with details like realistic vehicle movements. Sometimes a vehicle will even expose itself to enemy fire because it has to drive in reverse to get around an obstacle you left it parked against. Aside from the role-playing elements and the fact that you cannot replace human soldiers, the production and research aspects of the game are straightforward and similar to those in most other real-time strategy games. If you have the right tech, you can build a vehicle, and its armament and power plant are further functions of your technology. While Original War is ostensibly a tactical combat game, the tactical options are in fact laughably limited. For instance, only soldiers can crawl, and standing and crawling are the only two positions in the game.   The other thing that leads to a lot of saving and reloading is the fact that Original War is essentially a puzzle game: There are certain ""best"" ways to finish a scenario, and that's that. Each mission has multiple objectives, although you aren't given all of them right away, and you occasionally make choices as to which objectives you will fulfill. The missions are heavily scripted as a result, since there are a lot of sequential actions that advance the plot. This ""connect the dots"" approach manages to keep the missions moving, since if the gameplay were left to carry them along, Original War would be nothing more than a weak RTS with named characters and abilities and no innovation whatsoever. The most attractive part of the game, in fact, is the cutscenes, which are nicely done (visually, anyway) for both the American and Russian campaigns.   Despite the fact that this review now practically reads as an encyclopedia of why you shouldn't buy a game like this, Original War does have some appeal, albeit mostly for veteran gamers. This is because every lame trick they've learned while playing real-time strategy games as the genre has evolved comes into play here--standing units just out of visual range of an enemy turret until you get a force together to rush it, concentrating all your firepower on one enemy at a time while your scientist heals your soldiers (and while you hit the pause key every half second), or timing the AI patterns so that you can sneak your units past a strongpoint. It's all there. Since the simple gameplay should make the learning curve nonexistent for experienced players, playing through Original War is like redefeating all those games you've beaten over the past 10 years.   Original War is a game that you will have no desire whatsoever to play in your free time, but as soon as you have something important to do, it will become the most interesting thing imaginable. This is due almost solely to the game's pacing, which gives you new things to do at almost the exact point when you're ready to give up on how pointless and frustrating it is. While it gets tripped up (and eventually falls flat on its face) before getting very far due to its numerous crippling problems, it actually turns out to be somewhat better than you might have thought it would be. That last sentence, and the fact that the game is budget-priced, are the two best things that can be said about it. "
1187,Divide,5.0,1,"Divide's story blends elements of corporate greed, familial ties, and time travel with David at the center; a widower left sorting through the mess left behind when his wife passes away. After receiving an urgent message from a man who worked with his late wife, David takes his daughter Arly and meets with the man, who gives David a suitcase without explaining what’s inside. In the midst of a weird mishap with the strange technology inside the case, David is separated from his daughter and flung into the future, where he teams up with a young woman named Eris trying to escape a planet dominated by corporate control.Divide is an isometric game with elements of RPGs and twin-stick shooters. It’s a unique blend for a narrative-driven sci-fi game, and it oscillates between interesting and maddeningly dull. The main mechanic is driven by a pair of contacts David wears that allow him to interact with technology in the world via an augmented-reality UI. Using these contacts, he can hack into servers, upload data, control aspects of the environment, and even amass new abilities to interact with enemies.It works well--until it doesn’t. The contacts don’t become activated until you guide a reticle around David’s body using the right analog stick, and although it’s satisfying to discover new points of interaction in the environment--sort of like a digital treasure hunt--it’s frustrating to use the interface in any capacity other than fixed objects. Attempting to use it on an enemy proved fatal on multiple occasions when I’d fixate on one foe and attempt to hack them, only to have them move slightly and completely throw my alignment--and thus my aiming--off. The sensitivity can be adjusted, but it feels awkward regardless.These problems are amplified by Divide’s poor communication of objectives and location. A majority of the game is spent wandering aimlessly in sterile, repetitive environments, each looking practically identical to another in layout and presentation. The level map is difficult to read, the purpose and significance of different icons and actions aren’t clearly specified, and clues are easily missed in seemingly throwaway conversations with NPCs.The level flow follows a familiar pattern of wandering around the environment looking for specific terminals and uploading information to gain clearance to a new areas. Divide offers flavors of Metroid-style backtracking, but instead of new weapons or abilities used to progress, you’re rewarded with a clearance that allows you to unlock doors. The similarly constructed environments mixed with just a handful of occasional new elements and abilities to break up the pacing make Divide feel like one long, homogenized experience. Wandering around an area without any clear direction or information quickly becomes tedious and frustrating.Divide has a solid sci-fi hook, and like many forms of science fiction, it explores multiple themes in its Philip K. Dick-style narrative: the dangers of capitalism, corporate greed, maintaining a healthy family dynamic, and a humanist view of freedom from oppression. It explores all these elements to varying degrees of success. It’s easy to sympathize with Eris accompanying David, who wants nothing more than to escape the planet and the overreach of its techno-fascist state. The interactions with David and his daughter are believable and, at times, gut-wrenching, especially when they venture into discussion about her mother and her fierce dedication to work. Even the villains have a delightfully evil charm and chew an appropriate amount of scenery with glee.Divide stretches on for a bit longer than it probably should, but the strengths of the story are heightened by decent writing and voice performances throughout. Conversations feel organic and real, line deliveries have a satisfying amount of emotion, and each character comes across as genuine. But the strength of the story is undermined by a game that poorly communicates necessary information and is built on repetition to the point that it loses the personality contained within the characters. If there’s a second meaning to the title, it describes the division between a strong narrative and mediocre gameplay that would’ve been better served with more variety and direction throughout."
1256,Atlas Reactor,8.0,2,"Checkmate,"" I typed in chat, just as the my beefy warrior hero Titus slammed down his broadsword and killed the two shooters before him. Victory and game over.But ""checkmate"" is an apt enough word to use when playing this game. Atlas Reactor's cast might be filled with the likes of robo-puppies and gun-toting fishmen rather than sword-swingers or wooden pawns, but watching a match feels much like watching the ancient game of chess. It retains this feeling even with a host of influences--a bit of XCOM here, a dash of League of Legends there--and a multiplayer focus that pits two teams of four players against each other. It maintains a near-perfect balance of match length, tactics, replayability, and flow of action, and comes off as something unique and fresh.It's also turn-based, a design choice that initially comes off a poor bedfellow for its PvP emphasis. But the greatness of Atlas Reactor is that it works, in part because there's little waiting involved. Every player gets only 20 seconds to plan and position their next moves over a gridded map, and every player does this planning phase at the same time. The action winds up right as those 20 seconds wind down, and the moves play out on the map down lanes and conveniently placed walls. And then, tick-tock, it's time to start again, and this dance plays on for either 20 total turns or until one side kills five players. And as if to prove that Atlas Reactor seriously has a thing for the number 20, most matches last no more than that many minutes, which comes as a blessing when things aren't going well.Even with the decent tutorial, it's daunting for the first few matches. Once it kicks off, the action unfolds in a series of phases, all of which you have to account for with a library of five abilities within the space of 20 seconds. First, there's the Prep phase, which sees your hero lay down traps (or shout to weaken opponents, as my warrior Titus does). Right after that comes the Dash phase, which lets you dart out of the way if you're worried another player is about to unleash a big attack. That’s followed by the Attack phase proper, where you fire rocket launchers, unleash huge mechanical choppers, or swing greatswords depending on the hero. After all that comes the Movement phase, which lets your hero move to a new area in preparation for a new attack. Adding to the mix is a wide range of options for taking cover, power-ups for damage and health, three single-use ""catalysts"" for healing and short teleports, and a fog of war mechanic that lets you hide from enemies on specific tiles.Spelled out like that, it sounds comically unwieldy for the time allotted, but it makes sense in action. At least one of those abilities is an ultimate that can't be used unless you've amassed enough energy, and distance limitations often rule out certain abilities. At least half the time, I'd say, I'd locked in my moves before the 20-second timer even ran out.Much as in chess, a big chunk of the fun comes from guessing how the next turn plays out. I might have Titus ready to charge at an enemy player with low health on the other side of the map, but if he or she dashes away, I could end up swatting at air when I arrive. Or maybe there's a weakened enemy who could last a bit longer by picking up that nearby health pack, but I could thwart his plans by nabbing it first. Some of the best moments come down to skillful gambling, such as betting that a couple of enemy players will dash into the catastrophic area-of-effect attack I'm about to unleash.Communication by voice or chat interface naturally makes all this easier, although I've been in plenty of winning matches where the only words I see typed are ""lol""s when massive attacks miss. Atlas Reactor is nice enough to make this process easier by automatically hooking you up with a Discord channel before each match if you choose, and voice chat does much to get the most out of those 20 seconds.Could the game offer a bit more variety? Certainly. As it stands, it doesn't take long to learn the tricks and secrets each of the few maps present, which may be a tiny part of the reason why many random players don't bother with voice chat. And it's a world I'd like to see more of. There's even a story of sorts with lively, humorous cutscenes that's largely currently locked behind the multi-week ""seasons,"" which unlock collectibles like banners and emblems. This is a lively, cel-shaded universe that echoes The Fifth Element and any number of other cyberpunk settings while a catchy soundtrack thumps its beats in the background, and its cast of ""freelancers"" look as though they could rub shoulders with the cast of Overwatch and fit right in.There are 21 freelancers, with Juno and her twin-cannon harness being the last added for launch after months of beta. More will no doubt fill the ranks eventually, but I already admire how much the experience changes and renews itself when going from my favorite Titus to Celeste (who can steal power-ups with grappling hooks) or the cutesy Quark, who smothers friends with heals but blasts the bad guys with gamma rays. Nor is it mindless shooting--tactics figure in heavily, such as the way one freelancer can bounce laser blasts off walls and shift-clicks allow for precise maneuvers around traps. Even the progression system doesn't let things get out of hand, as it merely focuses on mods for your abilities and catalysts, with extra taunts and skins tossed in for fun.And since Atlas Reactor espouses a buy-to-play model, you merely have to pay $30, and all this is yours. (After all the 20s, I'm surprised it's not $20.) It's a nice break from the sometimes-oppressive free-to-play model that’s defined Trion Worlds’ games lately, although if you're not ready to plunk down cash, you can use the Free Mode that switches out different heroes each week. Smartly, as with so many other things about this game, those heroes are randomized by account rather than game-wide so that you're not always seeing the same five pop up in matches. And if you ever want to jump in ranked or custom matches and open more loot crates so that it feels like more than a largely functional trial, just pay the 30 bucks.A lot of what gets passed off as ""innovation"" in games these days is really better described as the successful alchemy of numerous existing styles, but rarely does this practice produce the kind of gold we find in Atlas Reactor. Sure, it could use a few more maps (and more are on the way), and its learning curve is just steep enough that it's briefly tough to see the fun on the other side, but it achieves its aims with style and flair."
1875,Surgeon Simulator 2013,4.0,0,"Playing Surgeon Simulator Anniversary Edition is akin to participating in a joke where you are the punch line. It's a game that is deliberately designed to feel unwieldy as you perform operations that require dexterity and finesse. Neither are to be found here; instead, you move your hand around the operating table and manipulate individual fingers to grab instruments and pray you don't accidentally drop them in the patient's exposed chest cavity. This is as much a ""simulator"" as Mario Kart is a driving test. Surgeon Simulator has been available on PC and tablets for over a year now, and each version has seen gradual content additions since its first release. On the PlayStation 4, the Anniversary Edition packages everything into a single download. The full range of surgeries is ready and waiting--heart transplants, kidney transplants, brain surgery, eye surgery, and teeth pulling. Each of these operations can be performed in different environments: an operating theatre, on a wheelie bed while running down a corridor, in the back of a bumpy ambulance, and in zero gravity. Just like the surgical instruments, bones and organs conform to a rudimentary physics system, and the different environments function as difficulty modifiers. It boggles the mind to understand how one could possibly perform these operations in zero-G given how fiendishly difficult their terrestrial versions are themselves. This is all part of the joke: you're expected to fail spectacularly and kill your patient multiple times. What ensues is a unique approach to interactive slapstick comedy that sees you attempting to open a ribcage but instead accidentally dropping a live buzz saw among the patient's exposed internal organs. In motion control mode, you rotate the arm and tilt the wrist by waving the gamepad in a similar fashion. The thing is, this joke is far funnier on PC than it is on PS4 because of the way the gamepad controls the surgeon's hand. With a mouse and keyboard, you have a far greater degree of accuracy and finesse available to you that, with practice, feels like it can be used constructively. Each individual finger of the surgeon's hand can be opened or closed with a separate key on the keyboard. Positioning the hand with the mouse allows for more precise, minute movements, which are necessary to complete the surgeries. On the PS4, the gamepad tells a different story. In motion control mode, you rotate the arm and tilt the wrist by waving the gamepad in a similar fashion. The interesting thing is that this actually feels more intuitive than the same motions on the mouse do. With the mouse, it feels like you are controlling a piece of machinery, making individual adjustments to the wrist's angle, the elevation of the hand, and the rotation of the arm, whilst stopping in between each step. That is where the PC's accuracy comes from. With the gamepad, you are making all of these motions at once. It feels far more fluid, but it's also impossible to achieve the same level of accuracy as in the PC version. Compounding this is the analogue nature in which the gamepad's triggers are used. You do not have fine control over the surgeon's fingers; instead, the harder you press the right trigger, the more fingers that close in a gripping motion. It's just plain frustrating attempting to be accurate this way. The elevation of the arm is also controlled in a similarly analogue fashion with the left trigger, and it too suffers from imprecision. An alternative control method which involves using the right thumbstick to replace the motion control components is less intuitive than the motion control itself, and still suffers from a lack of accuracy due to the analogue nature of the stick. But here's the thing: lack of accuracy in the controls is the whole point of Surgeon Simulator. That is the joke. However, when it comes to the difference between fun and frustrating, it's a matter of degrees. Playing Surgeon Simulator on PS4 is like listening to someone stumble through the telling of what could have been a hilarious wisecrack. The addition of achievements, some cheeky unlockable secrets, and a slight graphical upgrade over its original PC release doesn't make it funnier."
1286,Mother Russia Bleeds,7.0,2,"As a 2D brawler, Mother Russia Bleeds plays host to ideas dozens of years old, hearkening back to the days of beat 'em ups on arcade cabinets and early consoles. Mother Russia Bleeds allows you and up to three other players punch, kick, headbutt, and shoot your way through crowds of thugs in an alternate reality 80s Russia, with simple controls and a variety of weapons to use along the way.Where so many brawlers succumb to repetitive encounters, Mother Russia Bleeds, on the other hand, is a shining example of how to extract complex scenarios from simple mechanics.This is due in large part to the way its stages unfold. You not only grapple with a slew of multifarious fighters, but also wrestle attack dogs, leap away from speeding motorcycles, and evade clouds of poisonous gas. You'll learn how to control your fighter easily, but defeating a boss while trains barrel back and forth across the screen is another task entirely.In fact, the boss battles are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creative combat situations. Of the many present in Mother Russia Bleeds, a few stand out: luring helicopter turrets to shred your surrounding attackers; using flashbangs to stun opponents equipped with night-vision goggles; hurling enemies' grenades back at them as they advance behind a wall of riot shields. Mother Russia Bleeds is replete with brawls like this, and they upset the pacing of the beat em' up genre in exhilarating ways.Mother Russia Bleeds exudes a gorgeous retro pixel-art style, reflecting the existing design traits of its early brawler influences. Blood pools in the corners of the stage, with rough edges making their way down to the rectangular limbs of rotting corpses. The grisly aesthetic at play is an homage to the past, but it's rooted in very adult themes and background compositions: some of the most shocking include sexual acts at an S&amp;M club, or the deranged acts of drug addicts going through withdrawal.This is where Mother Russia Bleeds both excels and falters. For every insight it has about oppression, violence, and the direct correlations between both, it makes missteps elsewhere. It examines the effects a dictatorship can have on the common person, and whether violent action is ever justified when the government has gone too far. But too much of this brawler seems present just for shock value. Just as intriguing ideas gain traction, Mother Russia Bleeds introduces prison rape tropes or sexual jokes that upset any profundity it almost found.Mother Russia Bleeds is replete with creative brawls, and they upset the pacing of the beat em' up genre in exhilarating ways.A common thread is drug addiction--how it sneaks up on people, introduces itself slowly into their lives, and takes hold when they least expect it. From a gameplay perspective, drugs actually help you through the brawler: you can use Nekkro, a substance the dictatorial government uses to control its lower class citizens, to heal yourself or grant increased damage for a short time. If you don't completely behead an enemy, you can siphon the Nekkro from their blood, giving you more to use in the event of a future emergency.This creates a tense risk/reward factor throughout fistfights: should you drain that enemy's Nekkro now, and use the health to defeat the next mini-boss? Or should you destroy the crowd of enemies quickly and hope the Nekkro hasn't completely drained from their veins in the aftermath?Then there's the matter of cooperative play, and here, Mother Russia Bleeds is it at its finest. The obvious thrill of fighting alongside a friend or two is present, but the Nekkro dynamic becomes tantamount in multiplayer situations, considering you can heal allies with your drug supply. In some cases, I kept my Nekkro to myself. In others, I valued my friend's revival over my own peril. Drug addiction becomes not just a storytelling theme, but a gameplay motif as well.It's in its final moments that Mother Russia Bleeds approaches greatness, just before it stumbles. The final boss is one of the most abrasive difficulty spikes I've ever encountered in a game, let alone a difficult beat em' up. It took me 90 minutes to finally best. Compare that to about 20 minutes on the more difficult enemies I encountered throughout my playthrough. For all of the ways Mother Russia Bleeds paces itself so well over the course of 6 hours, its ending is drawn out to a fault.But for all of my frustration with the encounter, the difficulty of this boss made thematic sense: I had eliminated many thugs along my journey through a war torn Russia, from army captains to sadistic drug lords. But as its story comes to a close, and without spoiling the resolution, Mother Russia Bleeds asks the more important, if not slightly clichéd, question: isn't your biggest enemy yourself?This is Mother Russia Bleeds' greatest strength: it may appear to be a simple brawler with retro art reminiscent of the beat em' up golden age. But it goes much deeper. It alleviates the monotony of some of the best brawlers. It introduces wrinkles that make each level feel fresh. And it weaves complex themes into its gameplay in ways that, although not subtle, are nuanced. Mother Russia Bleeds knows how to upset many expectations of the genre--I just wish it wasn't always trying to shock me."
4481,Happy Feet,4.0,0,"  Games based on kid-friendly properties don't need to be inferior. It's a shocking sentiment, but games like Cars and Barnyard prove that an animated film can produce more than a cheap cash-in. It's too bad that Midway and Warner Brothers missed the memo and churned out another lame movie game that sucks the happiness right out of Happy Feet. As a licensed product, it's mediocre, with enough charming moments to rescue it from the immediate bargain-basement abyss. But as a game, it's an absolute insult and more likely to put kids to sleep than it is to entertain them.         In Happy Feet, you guide film hero Mumble through a pared-down version of his animated adventure. The emperor penguins value the ""heartsong"" over all other art forms and ostracize Mumble for his total lack of vocal prowess but considerable dancing skills. Even worse, they blame him for the disappearing fish population. Eventually, he finds a new family in a small flock of Hispanic penguins, but he later returns to find his home endangered by human ""aliens."" You'll meet a number of enchanting characters along the way: Ramon, the Taco Bell Chihuahua of the penguin world; Lovelace, an avian spiritual leader with a plastic six-pack ring wrapped around his neck; and Mumble's father Memphis, whose accent is more than a little inspired by Elvis Presley. Part Bambi, part The Lion King, and part Footloose, the game is noticeably lighter in mood than the movie. That's not bad, considering how serious and dark the film often gets. However, aside from the tone, Happy Feet retells the same basic story with a few clichéd additions that provide an excuse for the gameplay.     But there is barely anything there to justify using the license for a game, as opposed to, say, a pop-up book or a karaoke CD. Every level features only one of three basic minigames. Dancing mode is the usual Dance Dance Revolution-type level, with three difficulty settings ranging from easy to complete cakewalk. The songs aren't all featured on the film soundtrack, though, so fans may be stymied by the appearance of artists like KC &amp; The Sunshine Band and Dee-Lite. There are also some weird design choices in these segments. In the ""Somebody to Love"" level, the player is required to tap out rhythms of two, even though the song beat is in three. In the same level, the minigame ends and you exit the scene before the song is done, which is a letdown.      Both the swimming and belly-sledding levels take place on rails. Belly sledding is a tad superior thanks to its sense of speed. In these stages, you maneuver Mumble through slippery courses of ice and snow, sometimes collecting level-specific items or aiming for speed boosts that send you hurtling through the air. Other games like last year's The Chronicles of Narnia feature similar and superior scenes, but it's still mildly amusing in Happy Feet when soaring through the air after a particularly strong boost. Things slow down to a dead halt in the swimming levels, where you may be tasked with collecting ""lovestones,"" chasing fish, or escaping sharks. The objectives differ slightly every time, but the core gameplay is exactly the same: The level pulls Mumble along, and you steer him to and fro. On the console version (and the PC, if you use a gamepad instead of the arrow keys), you maneuver with the analog stick. On the Wii, you tilt the remote. Any way you slice it, it's far too simple to be any fun.     And sadly, that is all there is to it. 2004's Shark Tale featured many of the same modes but mixed them up nicely with a series of objectives that made the levels interesting. The difference between collecting hearts and collecting fish is negligible, though, which means that once you've played for 10 minutes, you've seen everything Happy Feet has to offer, even if you play through all of the game's three grueling hours. Granted, you earn medals in each level based on performance and getting gold medals unlocks the supposed ""extras."" But the unlockables are the same scenes you already saw in the dance levels, just without any gameplay. In other words, they're useless and an affront to the intelligence of players of any age, which completely eliminates any reason to collect gold medals in the first place.      But that's not the only insult Happy Feet has to offer. Including character Ramon and his heavy Mexican accent is one thing, but phonetically spelling out the stereotypical speech in the subtitles isn't amusing--it's offensive. For example, ""you"" is sometimes spelled as ""joo,"" and the fact that it isn't consistent just draws more attention to it when the lines are presented in that manner.      In the unlikely event that these three minigames are your cup of tea and you want to involve a friend--or abuse an enemy--you can ask another player to join you. In dance mode, this involves competing for the best score. In belly sledding, one player steers Mumble while the other presses button combinations (or flicks the Wii Remote) to smash obstacles in the way. Swimming involves collecting more items than your opponent. It's an amazing display of design failure: including a buddy doesn't make Happy Feet any more fun.         Happy Feet isn't exactly ugly, but it's got numerous graphical flaws that stand out. Some of the snowy environments are nice and feature falling icicles and destructible objects. But there are obvious seams where some polygons meet, as well as a ton of blurry textures to contend with. For a game based on an animated film, the models move stiffly and the speech is poorly synced with the beak movements. The lack of transition between the end of a level and the following cutscene is jarring--it just cuts immediately without so much as a fade. The PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions look identical to each other, while the PC version features an ""enhanced"" engine, which adds bloom lighting but looks otherwise unremarkable. The Wii version looks a little crisper than the other console versions, but not enough to make it worth another $20 bucks. Thankfully, the sound surpasses the visuals, due to a strong voice cast and John Powell's lovely orchestral score.      There's no reason to play Happy Feet. If you liked the film, buy another ticket and watch it again. If you still can't get enough, buy a licensed mug or something. And if you're looking for a gift to get your kids this holiday season, it's better to slip a lump of coal into their stockings than to offend them with this kind of branded rubbish.   "
4560,Woody Woodpecker Racing,4.0,0," 	Though many driving games for the PC try to be realistic simulations, there's always room for a game that bucks the trend and offers off-the-wall but fun and challenging gameplay. Woody Woodpecker Racing intends to be such a game: It tries to capitalize on the popularity of other similar arcade-like driving games by offering simplified driving physics, various cartoonlike weapons for taking out other drivers, and zany tracks that fit the overall theme of the game. Yet while Woody Woodpecker Racing does follow this basic formula, it fails to properly execute any of the core aspects of it. And because of its many frustrating features, the game will deliver a decidedly poor racing experience for both veteran and rookie go-kart drivers.  At the start of Woody Woodpecker Racing, you have access to four modes--quest mode, world championship mode, time-trial mode, and single-race mode. In the quest mode you can unlock additional characters and tracks based on your race performance, while the world championship mode gives you a score based on how you finish in each race; that is, the character with the most points at the end of the championship wins. The last two modes essentially serve as practice--you can learn the layout of each track and where any obstacles are located. All of these modes are standard for this type of game, but Woody Woodpecker tries to add more replay value with its hidden characters and tracks. However, since the gameplay has so many problems, you might have trouble justifying the effort to unlock the hidden items.   Once you select a mode and driver from the list--which includes popular characters like Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy--you proceed to the actual race. The controls for the race are really basic; acceleration, breaking, and jumping turns (where you jump going into a turn for sharper cornering) serve as the primary actions. But regardless of how basic the controls are, it's actually quite difficult to maneuver your driver in an effective manner because of the poor responsiveness of the controls and the game's bad track design. When you press left or right on the keypad or your controller, you don't actually get the sense that your driver is turning in either direction because the control is so sluggish. This becomes especially problematic on the off-road racing track where precise turns are absolutely necessary for avoiding objects, such as giant boulders. Even on one of the simple oval tracks, there are many occasions when it looks like you can make the turn, but because the control isn't as precise as it should be, you end up slamming into the wall. Jumping into turns helps remedy this problem slightly, but again, the sluggish controls often force you to overcompensate and collide with an obstacle on the track.  In Woody Woodpecker Racing, you can also use a standard attack where your driver swings a weapon out toward either side of the car, causing the other driver to stop if you make contact. There are also a number of special weapons that are obtained by running over item boxes located around the track, and some of these items are much more useful than others. Most of the less helpful items are just simple projectiles that have very little chance of actually hitting another driver, but there are other items that either automatically track other drivers or do universal damage to everyone on the track. Though you may have problems hitting other drivers with the different weapons, the computer has no such trouble. Nearly every time a computer opponent is near you, it is able to hit you immediately with either the default attack or with one of the special items. You may have trouble even finishing a race in some cases since you're constantly being bombarded with enemy attacks, which cause you to lose hot dogs--basically your life force--with each successive hit.   The game's graphics are poor even by the low standards for PlayStation-to-PC translations, and graphical glitches make the presentation all the worse. Aside from a remix of the familiar Woody Woodpecker theme song at the beginning of the game, the music and sound in the game aren't anything special, either. A few of the songs are reused multiple times for different tracks, which makes them start to get annoying after just a few racing sessions.   The biggest problem with Woody Woodpecker Racing is that it's just not fun. The computer constantly cheats by either receiving mysterious speed boosts or hitting you with perfectly timed attacks before you cross the finish. The already sluggish controls are made worse by the annoying track design where even the simple oval tracks are difficult to get through without colliding with some object on the side of the track other than the wall. And since there isn't even a multiplayer option in the game, there really isn't a suitable reason to buy or to play Woody Woodpecker Racing.      	  "
1859,Neverwinter,7.0,2,"It wasn't the promise of new lands to explore to dragons to slay that brought me back to Neverwinter; it wasn't even (at first) the opportunity to try out new classes. No, after an absence of several months, it was the opportunity to use the race-changing feature to transform my humdrum human great weapon fighter into a gloriously-bearded dwarf that sent me back into the arms of developer Cryptic's Dungeons &amp; Dragons online role-playing game. And against all expectations, I embraced it, if only for a little while. Neverwinter's combat still excels all these months later, and the time since launch has given it a semblance of an endgame it previous lacked. WildStar and Elder Scrolls Online stomped onto the scene, but few MMOGs do such a good job of capturing the experience of clobbering baddies with sharp, shiny blades. Somewhere, we're led to believe, an adherence to Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons serves as the foundation for all this, though that connection is a notable loose one. Consisting mainly of three action bars and two daily skills, the combat system provides the kind of fun that could catch on well when Neverwinter makes its jump to the Xbox One later this year. The combat holds up so well, in fact, that my time ""sampling"" the newish hunter ranger introduced last December turned into a leveling extravaganza that had me pushing to the level cap in just a few days. For leveling, it's probably a personal record. The absence of this staple fantasy class stung at launch, but it seems that slight wait wasn't for naught. There's a pleasing Legolas-style quality about the class: hit tab, and the iconic bow is switched out for a hotbar dedicated to finishing off enemies with a pair of lengthy daggers; hit shift, and he darts out of harm's way in an explosion of leaves. I also found some of that excitement in the new scourge warlock class. I only toyed with it across 10 or so levels, but that was enough time for the class to attract me more than similar classes in games such as World of Warcraft or Guild Wars 2. Here again, the focus is on movement. Press shift, and the warlock hovers across the landscape towards the next target, occasionally blasting foes with flames that cause them to rise from the dead as minions. She provides healing energy with the damage she deals, and her fluid attack animations make her great fun to play. With the hunter ranger and the scourge warlock, Cryptic proves that good new classes will bring back players who have left for other (presumably greener) pastures. The downside of my fling with the hunter ranger was that I had to experience the 12-50 leveling content all over again. Little has changed in this regard. As it was at launch, the core levels all feel as though Cryptic studied plumbing schematics for the leveling system, with the heroes themselves acting as Drano as they clear out the gunk on the way to the boss at the end. Sometimes you'll stop to pick up quests from non-player characters who spout stories that are never interesting enough to stick around listening to, and sometimes you must flip a switch instead of ram a sword through a goblin's heart. Neverwinter is beautiful at times, particularly in the forests of the Blackdagger Ruins and in the snow-capped mountains of Icespire Peak, but it never quite manages to rise above generic fantasy and assume an identity of its own. That identity is what made past Dungeons &amp; Dragons games like Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights so memorable. If you find a trace of that spirit here, it’s in the user-made quests found within the foundry. Cryptic may withhold key features such as loot distribution from player designers in the creation interface, but the scenarios themselves are filled with old pen-and-paper D&amp;D scenarios come to digital life. Some are episodic, and thus provide a reason to venture back to Neverwinter when Cryptic itself is in a content drought. If the content stumbles, it's only because the rating system doesn't rotate out new entries as much as it probably should. One entertaining foundry mission called ""Tired of Being the Hero"" has barely budged from its top spot since the days shortly after launch. But where do other people fit into all this? Neverwinter is curiously asocial for an MMORPG, even in the cooperative dungeons that usually form the foundation of long-lasting friendships in many of its competitors. They excel in visual appeal but fall short of any real challenge; most of the time, you're fine just chopping through foes and bosses as long as your healer isn't asleep. Healers don't even need to pay that much attention. The AI-controlled companions that heal you and aid your damage in the basic level content are allowed to follow you in, leaving Neverwinter's challenges just a notch about knowing when to stay out of the fire. And if you talk? Humorously enough, Neverwinter's popularity across multiple countries means it's not terribly uncommon to save the world in groups of four people who don't understand a word you're saying. There's a nice ""citizen of the world"" vibe about its community, sure, and it serves as a nice break from the name-calling and petty arguments you find elsewhere. It's not good, however, for forming the social bonds that games like this thrive on for longevity. For the MMO connoisseur who's more interested in wrecking his or her fellow players rather than working with them, Neverwinter also has a fun multiplayer component, but its battlegrounds are a mass of imbalances until you get to 50. Reaching the level cap unlocks the dwarven fortress of Gauntlgrym, however, and there's some fun in its 20-versus-20 battles that capture the thrill of sieges while demanding a modicum of strategy. Most of these options existed before. The succeeding months have brought an identifiable endgame to Neverwinter that adds vitality to the game apart from the tired imperative to level an alt. These are Neverwinter's campaigns, which shuttle you off to familiar locales like Icewind Dale for the promise of sweet loot if you can stomach the unyielding repetition of daily quests. In their favor, most of these manage to escape the tube-like progression of the core zones, opting instead to dole out quests from a central location that sends you to victory among various points of the compass. Taken together, Neverwinter's design would fall flat in a traditional subscription MMORPG, but it doesn't rank far below Path of Exile in terms of providing so much great content for so little. It also isn't as insistent on robbing you as the bandits who prowl its sewers; indeed, it's quite possible to reach the level cap without any assistance from the cash shop. Neverwinter seems to want to be the type of game that you can drop into with few complications after an absence of a few weeks or months, and it does this well.   The downside of all this is that the items you can buy are a bit on the pricey side, as if to make up for its otherwise liberal model. That's always been the case, but this tendency was most egregiously emphasized when Cryptic recently listed the price for the new Dragonborn race at $75. That borders on farcical; Skyrim sold for less when it launched. And as cool as they look, I'm not sure I could ever shake off the fear of what other players would think about my spending habits as I hulk about with my spiffy tail and scaly skin. It's hard to hold this against Cryptic, however, since the studio gives away so much for free. Tossing money at Cryptic for lesser purchases, such as accelerators for training minions or finishing crafting tasks, certainly makes life easier, but I accomplished my recent race to 60 with my Hunter Ranger without once spending a penny. I felt a little ashamed, in fact, as though I were pirating. But that frantic, free run up to the level cap says much about Neverwinter; in spite of its many flaws, it always manages to entertain with its movement-based combat and unrelenting action. Lose yourself in its trance, and it achieves and maintains a level of addictiveness that flags all too soon in other free-to-play MMORPGs like TERA: Rising. In a genre that's increasingly overcrowded, Neverwinter manages to establish itself as a game that's never fully boring, never too eager to rifle your pockets, and, well, never quite fun enough to stick around in for too long."
3756,Harlem Globetrotters (2005),5.0,1,"  Harlem Globetrotters turns the famous art of globetrotting into what is essentially a rhythm game, a surprisingly smart twist that seems to best accommodate the mobile platform. Unfortunately, the execution isn't as solid as the concept, and Globetrotters will meet neither your basketball nor your rhythm game needs.       The Harlem Globetrotters, one of the most famous sport franchises in the world, combine basketball and comedy into sport performances that usually involve the group decimating a lesser-qualified opponent with an arsenal of crazy moves you wouldn't see in a traditional basketball game. In this game, you play the part of a would-be Globetrotter trying to make the team. You use the four directional buttons to complete move combinations and rack up high scores. You're given an isometric view of the basketball court with your wannabe Globetrotter standing between the free throw and three-point lines, with four arrows on the ground around him. Small bubbles with similarly situated arrows will move toward those arrows on the ground, and the objective is to press the corresponding direction when the two arrows are aligned. This is very similar to the type of challenge presented in the Dance Dance Revolution games, although the necessary dexterity is required of your fingers instead of your feet. You'll get points for how accurately you match up the arrows, as well as bonuses for matching several arrows in a row.     During the challenge mode, currently enlisted Globetrotters will put you to the test with a series of six different point challenges before you can join their ranks. The difference between the levels is that the point requirement increases slightly between them and that the arrows move more frequently and quickly on the higher levels. However, the number of points you're awarded are increased for the higher levels, so they're not necessarily any more difficult than the beginning ones. As you correctly match up arrows, your character will execute fancy moves, until you've made six perfect matches. At that point, he'll run to the basket and dunk the ball. With both challenge and endurance modes, as well as the ability to upload worldwide high scores, there are a couple of different ways to get your globetrotting on.      The game's appearance is fairly good on the LG VX7000. The whole affair feels like it's steeped in the Globetrotters mythos, all the way down to the player likenesses that appear to taunt you or give you advice. The in-game sequences are a little less than spectacular, but since this is a rhythm game and not an actual basketball game, it's not too disruptive. The music, on the other hand, is not the cheerful refrain of ""Sweet Georgia Brown."" Instead, it's some scary bastardization that should be turned off immediately. The Globetrotters don't seem quite so spectacular without their classic refrain.       Unfortunately, when it boils down to it, Harlem Globetrotters' gameplay isn't nearly as interesting or entertaining as its subject material, even when the pace of the game picks up. It's too bad that Superscape couldn't have found more to do with its marriage of the license with the rhythm-game concept, which isn't a bad choice for mobile phones. Those seeking a mobile rhythm game should check out Taiko Drum Master instead. And even though Globetrotters is listed in the sports category of Verizon's Get It Now, mobile basketballers should move on down the line, too.    "
1565,Blues and Bullets,7.0,2,"Santa Esperanza or Sin City? I found it hard to tell the difference between the two black-and-white burgs in the first episode of Blues and Bullets, a five-part adventure series from indie developer A Crowd of Monsters that sets a striking neo-noir tone. There are just as many shadow-streaked rooms, rain-swept streets, and bloody red accents as in anything scripted by Frank Miller, while the plot is stuffed with enough psychos, horrific violence, and cornball dialogue to make Dashiell Hammett roll over in his grave. This is an inspired rip-off for the most part, however, hitting the same notes as a good hard-boiled detective novel despite a few offbeat scripting choices and some technical glitches. As noted above, the location is a crime-ridden fictional city called Santa Esperanza. The year is 1955. The protagonist is Eliot Ness, but not the historical figure or even the fake one from TV and movies. This take on the leader of the famed Untouchables who brought down Chicago gangland boss Al Capone is different from anything seen before. Instead of taking out old Scarface with a tax case, Ness wound the case down with a Schwarzeneggerian shootout, slaughtering a dozen or more mobsters single-handedly while so drunk he could barely stand up. Twenty or so years later, Ness is a haunted ex-cop running a diner and trying to run away from his past, which includes murdered friends, an unhealthy attachment to a dead buddy’s wife, and a whole lot of booze and guilt. All this is complicated by the fact that Capone has just been paroled and is asking his old nemesis to help find his daughter, who has been kidnapped by a sinister cult that is abducting, mutilating, and sometimes slaughtering little kids. All in all, it’s an innovative look at an American icon crossed with a more modern serial killing saga. But it’s also kind of off-putting because everyone knows the story of Ness and Capone courtesy of decades of TV shows and movies. I eventually came to appreciate this bizarre new angle on characters I thought I knew, although I never completely abandoned the notion that all this messing with history was sort of unnecessary. This version of Ness only shares a name with the real person, and the same goes for Capone. Swapping out Chicago for Santa Esperanza is also an odd choice given the use of real names for the lead characters. Why not go one way or the other? Doing both makes the whole story feel somewhat off-kilter, for no real purpose. Added alt-history weirdness creates a surreal mish-mash. Strange concepts are tossed in for kicks, like the apparent survival of the Hindenburg and its subsequent renovation into a luxury hotel in the clouds. You visit it early on in the episode as a real place, but it is so impossibly huge and luxurious that it’s more Xanadu than retrofitted zeppelin. Even though you’re supposed to be on board the big balloon, you also see that famous photo of the airship exploding into flames over Lakehurst, New Jersey framed in its hallways. I was never sure what to think here. All things considered, the plot is innovative and guaranteed to keep you guessing about what’s coming next. Blues and Bullets’ gameplay is standard for an adventure game, although both the action and sleuthing is more involved than that in other similar series in the episodic genre. This is more of a traditional adventure game than what Telltale produces, for example. The structure isn’t quite as linear. Many choices influence the flow of the story, and dialogue options run a gamut of emotions that subtly alter how interactions play out with other characters. There is also more of a necessity to explore environments. Investigations are hands-on. Ness tackles a gruesome murder by examining the entire scene, from the occult altar made of severed hands in the bathroom to the impaled corpse in the living room and the discarded spoon in the hallway, which may have been used to scoop out the victim’s eyeballs. Ness puts clues together on a deduction board that leads him to conclusions. Nothing here is particularly challenging, although the process replicates the step-by-step nature of a criminal investigation. Action scenes are also more involved. Button-press fights and reactions are similar to those in more casual adventure series, but they tend to demand a little more from the player. Again, there isn’t anything here too tough, although you do have to hit buttons a little more quickly and more often than in similar games. In addition to the bare-knuckle sequences, there are also firefights in which you take cover and blast away at enemies. Anyone with even the most rudimentary arcade skills will be able to take on these vaguely GTA-inspired battles without breaking a sweat, but at least the game goes through the motions and gives you more to do. I’m hoping that future episodes ramp up the challenge and take advantage of the gangster setting with some serious gunplay. What makes Blues and Bullets really stand out is its atmosphere. The game looks like an interactive version of the Sin City movies. The entire game is cloaked in long shadows and a gloomy air of menace, which is built up to such an extreme that even Ness’s diner in the middle of a sunny afternoon comes off as a midnight spook house. Surreal touches add to this effect. A dream sequence illustrating Ness’s tortured thoughts plays out as a gunfight in and around giant headline letters recounting just how corrupt and awful his world has become. Other stylish touches add tension. While most of the game consists of high-contrast black-and-white, red accent slashes are everywhere. This is of course used to indicate blood and to create a constant threat of violence. Even Ness’s ever-present red tie is a warning sign that bad things are about to go down. The dialogue is also very good, albeit in the cheesy vein of old-time noir. Ness is pretty much the prototypical self-flagellating private detective with a weakness for booze and dames. Many lines teeter on the edge of self-parody. At times it’s not entirely clear whether the game is actually laughing at itself. While most of the story takes everything as seriously as an IRS audit, some aspects are over the top. One moment in which Ness interrupts a knife-thrower to the disappointment of the crowd and his now-perforated female target is so played up for slapstick that the Untouchable briefly turns into Frank Drebin. The voice acting is all over the place, but the leads are good for the most part. Ness is played as kind of a growly, boozy take on Batman, and Capone is a no-surprises, marble-mouthed thug. The cast is small, though, and actors try to hide their multiple roles with broad accents that do nothing but make the game seem amateurish. Another issue that illustrates the indie nature of Blues and Bullets is the presence of a few bugs. Slowdown is the most noticeable problem. Every so often, the game will drop to single-digit framerates. This usually takes place during panoramic introductions that sweep across city blocks. On a couple of occasions, this brought the game to a complete halt for me and forced a restart. Another annoyance was a cursor that never stayed still. On selection menus in the options and within the game itself as I organized the investigation board, the selected option constantly clicked to the right regardless of whether I was using the mouse and keyboard or the gamepad controls, forcing me to push back against the grain to make a choice. This was merely an irritant, although it could have been show-stopping if the game had demanded more interaction in this fashion. Although Blues and Bullets isn’t without its flaws, this first episode sets a distinctive comic-book, crime-noir attitude compelling enough to keep you playing and looking forward to what the series will offer in future installments. Anyone who enjoys classic noir fiction or the decidedly modern, bloody take on it offered up on the grim streets of Sin City will find a lot to like here.  "
2478,LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4,8.0,2,"  If you're familiar with developer Traveller's Tales' previous Lego games, you might think you know what Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is like even before you've played it--and you'd be partially right. In this game, just as in Lego Star Wars and its ilk, you (perhaps along with a friend on the same console) experience a witty and wordless rendition of a famed tale, with your favorite characters replaced by blocky Lego re-creations. Yet central elements of the previous games, such as simplistic combat and floaty platforming, have been given a secondary role in Harry's story. Now, the focus is squarely on collecting all those countless Lego bits that go flying everywhere with almost every spell you cast. You're constantly showered with currency as you solve light puzzles and manipulate practically every object you see with your versatile wand. You still need to contend with a few of the series' lingering issues (unhelpful AI, slippery platforms) and a couple of minor new ones (iffy targeting, random bugs). But the scattered flaws aren't likely to dampen the joy of playing Lego Harry Potter, particularly if you're a fan of the source material.      Prisoner of Azkaban, which is super fun to play, but makes no sense within the context of the original story.      Such action sequences are rare in Lego Harry Potter, though there are still light combat sections and boss fights. You defeat Dementors by casting the Patronus Charm, fight Aragog by throwing spiders at him using Wingardium Leviosa, and even take on He Who Must Not Be Named. Most of the time, however, you're scouring the environment looking for ways to use your ever-increasing repertoire of spells. You can switch between spells easily and cast the one you prefer, and in certain cases, such as using Lumos to make vines wither away, you need to select the spell manually. However, most spells are contextual and can be cast by holding a button and hovering the spell cursor over the object you want to manipulate. The targeting can be a little iffy; sometimes the halo indicating an interactive object won't appear when it seems it should, and it's really easy to target something you don't intend to--such as an unsuspecting student. But this is a mostly insignificant inconvenience. For the most part, you'll be smashing everything that's smashable and reconstructing everything that's reconstructible, reaping the bits that scatter as a reward for charms well cast.        Between levels, you can head to Diagon Alley to spend your pips on new characters, costumes, spells, and other unlockable trinkets. But the goal of all the spellcasting isn't just to gather money; it's to solve environmental puzzles to progress to the next chapter. The puzzles aren't difficult; you can solve almost any of these conundrums by simply making sure you've hovered your spell cursor over everything you possibly can. But doing so is a lot of fun since there's so much variety in how various environmental elements react to your manipulations. Sconces light up and lavish you with fireworks. Mops clean puddles, and brooms sweep up dusty paintings. The inhabitants of Hogwarts' living portraits toss you important trinkets, or grant you access to new areas if you're controlling a member of the right house. If you're controlling Ron, Boggarts appear as spiders, and casting Riddikulus causes them to clumsily dance about on roller skates for a few moments. (If you're controlling Harry, these same Boggarts appear as Dementors.) You release Scabbers or Crookshanks to enter confined spaces, and you brew Polyjuice potions when you need to appear as another student. There's a lot to do, all of the time, and while none of these tasks are challenging, the diversity keeps things always enjoyable.      Between story missions, you can explore Hogwarts and other optional areas, such as Gringotts Bank. You might finish a quick play through in six hours if you're just interested in seeing the story, but Lego Harry Potter is the kind of game you return to again and again to uncover its various secrets and collectibles. You won't be able to enter certain areas and perform certain spells your first time through, so to see everything the game has to offer, you must return to the levels in free play using different characters. Even if you think you're being thorough the first play through, you'll be lucky to approach 50 percent completion. But whether it's your first time through or your fifth, you should take another wizard to class with you. While there is no online co-op (again), another player can drop in at any time and take over for one of your AI companions. Not only does having a buddy with you make for a better time, but you won't need to rely on the friendly AI, which isn't always helpful when it comes to cooperative puzzle solving. Luckily, AI failings are much less common now than in previous games, and co-op puzzles aren't frequent, making these imperfections a minor quibble.       The AI isn't the only lingering flaw to carry over into the newest Lego game, but like that particular aspect, the others have been thankfully marginalized to the point of being barely noticeable. Slippery edges and odd camera angles hinder a couple of platforming sequences, but there are so few of them that you won't be too bothered. Similarly, while there are some combat sections, they are very light, and few of them feature the respawning enemies that tainted Lego games of years past. In fact, they come as a happy change of pace among the many puzzles. We did encounter several bugs, however. In a trip to Hagrid's pumpkin patch, we couldn't interact with important objects after a short while, which necessitated a level restart; a similar problem forced us to restart a battle against the perpetually scowling Draco Malfoy. It's to the game's credit that such problems are so easily dismissed in light of all the fun and variety that so deftly veils them.     Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is easily the best Harry Potter game to date, though if that sounds like a backhanded compliment, consider this: It's one of the finest Lego adventures to date as well, which is no faint praise. By minimizing the repetitive combat and inconsistent platforming, Traveller's Tales has also minimized the frustrations, making this excursion to Hogwarts enjoyable for the whole family. Minor flaws, old and new alike, keep Lego Harry Potter from becoming a family-friendly classic, but it's charming and funny, and most importantly, it's fun. And that kind of magic is all too uncommon, even in Harry's world.    "
1084,LawBreakers,7.0,2,"Ever since the introduction of jump pads in shooters, an FPS that offered greater freedom of flight was inevitable. Lawbreakers feels like one such result. There's a moderate learning curve to maneuvering and surviving in-air and within the myriad anti-gravity spheres of the game's arenas. When you do manage to adapt to sniping on the fly or boosting down a corridor with strategic purpose, the resulting outcomes can feel sublime even if you rarely receive the post-match MVP award.Even with the possibility of vertical movement, FPS maps are wasted if there aren't adequate weapons and abilities to play with. Lawbreakers addresses this challenge through an intelligible diversity in the armaments and specialities spread across its nine classes. There's a reasonable assortment of advanced finesse fighters, beginner-friendly gateway classes, and well-rounded combatants who are useful in any map/mode combination. Even after about 100 matches, it was pleasing to see that no one class dominated, especially among high performing players, which is a credit to developer Boss Key's thoughtfulness in honing these characters.The lack of standardized weapon and movement types make each of these fighters all the more distinct. The Vanguard, for instance, offsets the immense potency of having a gatling gun by not having a secondary weapon. The lack of boosts or upward mobility makes the armored Titan seemingly useless when delivering the batteries in Overcharge, but this class is invaluable for guarding the battery when it's charging at your base (the mode's main goal). And learning how to optimize a role based on your team makeup, map, and mode is part of the fun, which is perpetuated by the welcome ability to change your classes mid-match.brWhile Lawbreakers isn't the type of shooter that awards skill-boosting gear as you level up, discovering additional gameplay depth after getting the hang of flying becomes its own reward. Like experienced Street Fighter competitors, advanced players will feel a sense of accomplishment learning which tactics and attacks work best against specific classes. The challenge is in discerning who you're fighting in a given moment since the already-cluttered user interface does little to convey that specific kind of visual information. Tailoring an attack strategy against a class works when you're in a sudden mid-air duel just yards apart, less so when you're trading shots across a courtyard and you can't tell if you're firing at an Assassin or a Wraith.From the Asian-influenced architectural designs of the Redfalls map or the futuristic shopping mall that makes up the Promenade arena, Lawbreakers' battlegrounds are well-carved to accommodate every class. The balanced mix of wide open spaces and confining passages in all of Lawbreakers' maps present a wealth of combat scenarios. That includes turning the tables on the predator/prey dynamic or using your environment to gain a tactical advantage. The Juggernaut, in particular, will no doubt become the bane of many, thanks to the class' hallway-sized pop-up barrier. Imagine playing the swift Assassin, thinking that you had a straight shot to deliver a ball to the goal, only to have the Juggernaut throw up a wall at the homestretch.Such obstacles are easily countered by knowing the alternative routes. As with any shooter map, time is the only factor preventing you from committing every turn, shortcut, and hiding spot to memory. A common benefit of knowing the layout well is the palpable gratification of taking a battery or ball from the center of the map to your goal in less than 5 seconds in the Overcharge and Blitzball modes.This map memory learning curve wouldn’t be as steep if not for all the time you spend running into locked doors and crossing invisible boundaries that pick away at your health. The maps' other shortcoming is the environmental art style, where futuristic surroundings can't mask the arenas' uninspired visuals.The contrast of richness in functionality and lack of memorable visuals also applies to Lawbreakers’ ensemble cast. Their designs support the notion that high detail does not equate to pleasing aesthetics. You only need to look to the class selection screen to see the fighting game influence, where a large and culturally diverse group exude personality, hungry for a fight. Yet despite their array of outfits and confidence-oozing body language, this group largely lacks the magnetic charisma that inspires loyalty and discussion of favorite characters in real life.brWith any given Quick Match, your mileage will vary on how many strangers decide to work as team players. It's a testament to the combative appeal of Lawbreakers that it's not unusual to engage in brief isolated duels. Whether a player's motivation is to distract an opponent from the objective or the bloodlust of notching another kill, it's a shame that there is no Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch mode to add variety to a suite of match types centered around delivering items to goals or dominating territory.Given the unique demands of anti-gravity gameplay, the PC version's comprehensive yet concise tutorials turn out to be crucial for onboarding new users. That makes their puzzling omission from the PS4 version disappointing. The fact that you're given currency for participating in the tutorials on PC only twists the knife. To further affirm the PC version as the preferred platform, we also experienced post-match glitches that forced us to relaunch the game from time to time on PS4.Lawbreakers delivers dopamine hits beyond the arena through post-match score tallies and letter grading. Continuous play also begets higher player profile levels which--after every level up--yields Lawbreakers' cosmetic customization reward: Stash Crates. Capitalizing on the ever-popular, anticipation-driven appeal of random card packs, these loot boxes--packing four items of various rarities (and the occasional in-game currency)--reinforce Lawbreakers’ replayability. And the spectacle of opening these crates is as ceremonious and well-animated as anything you’ll find in Madden or Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.One sign of any worthwhile team-based shooter is a level of accessibility where everyone feels they can contribute no matter their play style, and Lawbreakers succeeds in this manner. And while the lack of Deathmatch is a lost opportunity, its sufficient playlist of modes offers a viable outlet to flaunt your kill/death ratio, even if it's at the expense of team success. What counts is that its fresh anti-gravity mechanics transcends its first-glance novel appeal and creates limitless combat situations that will be new and inviting to many shooter fans."
1453,Yakuza 5,8.0,2,"Just like the games of Brendan McNamara (The Getaway, L.A. Noire), the Yakuza series has always belonged at that end of the urban open world game spectrum where gameplay takes a backseat to story. We’re talking about Metal Gear Solid levels of exposition through lengthy cutscenes. Yakuza 5’s heavy themes of honor among criminals and workplace loyalty are aptly presented through the lens and production values of a big budget TV show, and you’d be hard pressed to come up with any game outside this series that features this much melodramatic piano music.If there’s one key feature from Yakuza 4 that this sequel capitalizes on, it is the value of having multiple stories. As much as Kazuma Kiryu could be effective as a solo protagonist, having four other playable characters, each with their own lengthy and fleshed-out storylines, adds immense value to Yakuza 5. These journeys are personal, and plot threads intertwine like those of a Tarantino film, and converge at the end like a narrative Voltron.Kazuma kicks off Yakuza 5 on an intriguing note: disguised as a taxi driver making a modest living in Fukuoka. Between highway racing challenges and standard driving missions, there’s a lot of entertaining taxi gameplay to distract you from the story for hours. Unlike other games of its ilk, Yakuza 5 treats driving around city streets as a challenge, with strict traffic laws to follow--until you get on the highways, where anything goes. Another chapter puts you in the shoes of ex-con Taiga Saejima, deep in a snowy forest and far away from the game's concrete jungles This leads to a surprisingly engrossing hunting minigame where stalking prey without startling them is harder than it looks--especially when the intensity of snowfall fluctuates frequently--causing you to take a breath and compose yourself before every shot.Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws.Taxi racing and hunting are just two of myriad diversions that support Yakuza 5's tale, and with over two dozen types of minigames, there's a lot to discover when you're out and about. It’s brilliant that arcades in the game feature an arcade-perfect version of Virtua Fighter 2 and that Namco Bandai’s Taiko Drum Master exists, even if it only has a three-song playlist. Casino games like poker and baccarat are well-represented, as are traditional sports practice areas like batting centers and driving ranges. When enduring the failure of my fifth attempt at grabbing a plush toy from a UFO Catcher, I couldn’t help by recall my struggles at the similar games of chance in Shenmue, and in real life.Nothing in Yakuza 5 underscores the series’ passage of time more than Haruka Sawamura’s story arc. Originally the young girl who was the plot’s focal point in the first game, she is now sixteen years old. Her continued and consistent relevance in the series serves as one of the many rewards to fans who have followed Yakuza since the first game. In Haruka's world, there is only one sensible career path for a Japanese teenage girl: idol singer. I afforded myself one eyeroll at this unoriginal premise before I wholeheartedly jumped into the early stages of her burgeoning career.Given the series’ history with rhythm-based action, mostly through karaoke, this chapter will be familiar to Yakuza fans. It’s not just about matching button inputs to on-screen prompts during a practice session in the dance studio. There are meet-and-greets with fans, appearances on various TV shows, and even dance-offs in the streets.Haruka’s variety show appearances are impressively authentic, not just with the banter between her and the host, but also with the lighting and camerawork. It’s not for everybody, but it's a welcome interlude from the heavy doses of suspense and intrigue in the other plotlines. Still, Yakuza 5 never veers too far from the beaten path, with Rival idols and conflicts with competing management companies providing a dash of drama to Haruka's tale.Although Yakuza 5 never attempts to be a real simulation of life in Japan, the areas of selective realism within are one of its biggest draws. I still remember walking into a convenience store in the first game and admiring the level of detail, from the magazines to the bright and unflattering overhead lighting. This and many other types of business look all the more detailed in Yakuza 5, right down to the pastel color schemes in the pharmacies. And as much as one can survive the game’s more hostile sections with a boost from energy drinks, sometimes you just want a bowl of health-replenishing ramen or curry. Given all of Yakuza 5’s urban attractions and the vibrancy of most of its various large locales, you’d think that Sega received a subsidy from the Japan National Tourism Organization.The core combat in Yakuza 5 is mostly unchanged since the first game and it’s a credit to the series that this hasn’t become totally stale after all these years. Fans will immediately recognize Kazuma’s fighting animations, especially when he’s smashing opponents’ faces with a unusual weapons, including the likes of a bicycle. The tried-and-tested combat serves Yakuza 5 well, but without any type of counter system for self-defense, it shows its age.Make no mistake, though, there is depth to Yakuza 5's combat. Throws, dodges, and opportunities to learn new moves ensure that fights aren't a one-dimensional affair. The series was one of the first street brawlers to include context-sensitive environmental finishing moves, a feature that was improved upon by United Front Games’ Sleeping Dogs, and it's put to great use here. Smashing a thug’s face on the side of a building never gets old; it always looks brutal, but more importantly, it offers a gratifying sense of finality to a fight. As much as you can mash your way to victory with quick attacks, these deadlier moves are doubly effective in scaring off the other gangsters, turning a sixty-second brawl into a fifteen-second display of intimidating might. Of course, moments of slapstick complement the harsh side of combat, including the use of an injured foe as a weapon against his unfortunate buddies, adding insult to injury.Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan.While playing the prior games isn’t a prerequisite, loyal fans who have followed the Yakuza series up to this point will feel rewarded with every throwback, whether it’s the return of a supporting character or a revisit to a ramen shop that has remained in business for multiple games. Even if melee combat lacks the sophistication of modern action games, Yakuza 5 makes up for its modest shortcomings with enthralling diversions and eye-popping settings that compel one to look at travel deals to Japan. Come for the stories, but stick around for Yakuza 5's world; it's unconventional in the best way possible"
715,MLB The Show 19,9.0,2,"MLB The Show 19 begins with an ode to spring: the opening cutscene waxes lyrical about the world blooming into color with bright blue skies and beaming sun rays amid the chirping of birds, before moving onto the hope, optimism, and excitement that accompanies a new season of Major League Baseball. America's favorite pastime is synonymous with the transition from winter's gloomy doldrums to the warmer weather of spring, and Sony San Diego's long-running baseball series has become a complementary part of that equation. This is due in no small part to the high level of quality The Show has maintained throughout its lifespan, and MLB 19 is no different, implementing smart new tweaks and significant refinements to its on-field action, while introducing entertaining new modes to its authentic flavor of baseball excellence.Fielding has received the most substantial improvements out on the diamond, with the Defensive Runs Saved metric coming to the forefront. Now any player wearing a leather-clad glove is more responsive than before, hustling to field weakly hit balls, recovering quickly from botched catches, and utilizing a plethora of new animations to give you added control over the defensive side of the game. There's also a clear distinction between each fielder's individual stats, so if you've got a Gold Glove player like Matt Chapman manning the hot corner, you'll notice how adept he is at reaching balls lesser fielders will have trouble getting to. An outfielder's reaction to the ball jumping off the bat varies depending on their attributes, too, while a new interface makes it easier or harder to read balls that careen off the outfield wall depending on the defending player's skill set. There's an intuitive fielding ability indicator under the feet of each player to give you a quick reference point for how likely they are to pull off a spectacular play versus an embarrassing one, and that means substituting that beefy power hitter you've lodged into left field is now a tactical switch worth considering in the later innings. Each of these changes contributes to a greater sense of control over how your team prevents runs, removing a lot of the frustration that plagued previous games when fielders were often too lackadaisical.At the plate, batting feels slightly more forgiving this year. There's now a greater distinction between the types of contact you can make with the ball, and a larger variety of hits makes batting more enjoyable. Not to mention pitchers are now actually concerned with self-preservation, so you won't encounter quite as many stolen hits because the pitcher's face was in the way. These changes coalesce to make a strong aspect of the game even stronger, and few feelings can match the elation that arises when you square up a ball and hear the crack of the bat as it flies into a gap in center field.In terms of modes, the most notable new addition is March to October, which essentially acts as a truncated and more streamlined version of the time-consuming Franchise Mode. In the past, Sony San Diego has made strides in contriving various ways to make Franchise less of a time sink. Being able to expedite a 162-game baseball season by alternating between playing full games or using quick manage and player lock was a welcome change, but it's still a lengthy endeavor that most will still want to simulate through at times. However, there's always an inherent degree of detachment that comes from simming your way through blocks of the season. March to October alleviates this issue by making your performances impact your team's form, even if you're only playing for two or three innings at a time.At the outset, March to October asks you to pick a team, categorizing all 30 MLB teams based on their expectations as either favorites, contenders, underdogs, or longshots. It doesn't matter whether you pick a team like the Yankees or the Orioles, your ultimate goal is to reach the postseason and win the World Series. The majority of the season is automatically simulated, but during critical moments you'll be dropped into games in a variety of situations to try and earn a positive outcome. These can range from taking over a game in the eighth inning of a blowout with the simple aim of maintaining a shutout, joining in the sixth to break open a tied game, or stepping into the batter's box with two outs in the ninth and a man on second when your team is down by a single run. Your performance in these situations earns you either positive or negative momentum, and this affects your team's results during those simulated games. Obviously, there's a little more leeway here if you're using one of the powerhouse teams as opposed to a relative minnow, but momentum ensures your performance has a palpable effect on how well your team does even when you're not directly involved. Maintain positive momentum and you'll see your team go on a winning run, while the opposite is true if you fail to meet your objectives. You'll also occasionally have the opportunity to use player lock in certain games, with that player earning a season-long bonus if you, say, drive in three runs or crush a game-winning homer.Completing a full season takes roughly 10 to 15 hours, and winning the World Series at the conclusion of March to October nets you rewards for MLB 19's card-collecting mode, Diamond Dynasty. This won't be a mouth-watering incentive for everyone, and March to October still consumes enough time that there's little replay value involved. Nevertheless, it's an engaging new mode that consistently puts you in situations tailor-made for some thrilling topsy-turvy baseball. It may lack depth due to an absence of roster moves, with a single deadline day trade the only chance to augment your team, but for those who don't have time to commit to Franchise Mode, it's a fantastic alternative.Moments is another new addition that also drops you into crucial situations, with the key difference here being their historical significance. Playing as the likes of Babe Ruth, Nolan Ryan, Willie Mays, and other icons of the sport, Moments lets you relive the classic plays, at-bats, pitching performances, and playoff series of these legendary players' Hall of Fame careers--complete with authentic stadiums and a black and white filter. It's not a perfect recreation of baseball's past, with plenty of default players on top of contemporary commentary and graphic overlays. There's also little fanfare when you pull off a historic feat, with not even so much as a single line of dialogue. Yet despite these missteps, it's still exciting to call your homerun with The Bambino, mash your way to a .400 average with Tony Gywnn, or win the Chicago Cubs' first World Series in 108 years. Moments also provides another avenue to earn rewards for Diamond Dynasty, beyond giving you the opportunity to play as historic players before unlocking their playing cards.This is a common through line in MLB 19: Almost everything you do contributes to Diamond Dynasty in some way. This makes it relatively easy to assemble a competitive team without having to spend a dime of real-world money, and there are still multiple ways to engage with Diamond Dynasty in both single and multiplayer capacities, depending on your preference, from playing against others online to conquering maps in Conquest Mode, drafting a team in Battle Royale to ascend a ladder, and completing various challenges. The variety of options mixed with the frequent stream of rewards makes Diamond Dynasty one of the most enjoyable card-collecting modes in the genre.Elsewhere, Road to the Show introduces a few more RPG elements this year to give dialogue options some much-needed impact. During the creation of your player, you have to choose between reworked archetypes, with each one acting as a physical blueprint for the type of player you want to be. There isn't a level cap anymore, so you can feasibly increase each of your player's stats to 99 overall, but your chosen archetype governs how easy or difficult it is to improve specific attributes. For instance, pick a Small Ball hitter and you'll find it easier to train your speed, fielding, and stealing, while it will be much harder to improve power and plate discipline, with contact and arm strength falling somewhere in the middle. Enhancing these stats still relates to your on-field performance, with a base hit correlating to an increase in contact, and so on. There are new minigames based around weightlifting and other exercise drills, too, allowing you to progress certain attributes if you want to put in the extra work off the field.During the character creation process you're also asked to choose between four personality types: lightning rod, captain, heart and soul, and maverick. Each dialogue option in Road to the Show relates to one of these personalities, so picking the captain option to give a teammate some encouragement when he's in the midst of a slump will upgrade your captain attributes, which in turn allows you to unlock various perks within a modest skill tree. Reach tier two in heart and soul, for example, and you can activate a perk that improves your hitting ability when in 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, and 3-1 counts, ensuring your dialogue choices manifest in meaningful bonuses when at the plate. Forming a relationship with teammates or an antagonistic rivalry with another team's players will make these perks more powerful as well. Occasionally you'll also be asked to pick between three challenges during particular moments in games, whether it's simply getting on base or striking out the next batter. Each challenge has a boost to stats related to it, with harder challenges providing a more substantial boost if you're successful. This is only a small touch, but it gives you an extra opportunity to improve your player by balancing the risk and reward of picking a harder challenge over a simpler one. There's no doubt smashing a home run over the left field wall is more exhilarating than usual when a 175% boost is active.As for Franchise Mode, there's not really a lot to say. Contracts now more closely mirror their real-life counterparts, both in terms of years and money, and you can finally re-sign players before they reach the end of their current deal. This adds authenticity to the business side of Franchise Mode, but otherwise it's the same as it has been for a few years now. There's still no team relocation, stadium building, or online Franchise Mode, which is disappointing considering these are staples in other sports games. On the plus side, at least you can now use two-way sensation Shohei Ohtani as a designated hitter on days he's not pitching without having to waste a substitution.Despite the lack of innovation in Franchise Mode, MLB The Show 19 excels when it comes to the sheer variety of single-player content on offer, while significant improvements to fielding round out the on-field package, making this one of the best baseball games ever. That's not a particularly bold statement considering the series' consistent quality throughout the years, but MLB 19 continues that upward trajectory with its most robust offering yet, guaranteeing another year's worth of excellent baseball."
1589,Her Story,8.0,2," The catch-22 is that talking about the game involves a spoiler minefield. Every word that inches up to what Her Story ultimately becomes cheapens what’s waiting for players down this particular rabbit hole. One should at least have a grasp of the setup, You boot up the game, and you’re presented with an ancient relic of a mid-90s police database, already keyed into a series of grainy VHS interviews with a shy, evasive woman speaking to an unseen, unheard interrogator. The single keyword searched for is “murder.” Five videos are pulled up at the start totaling maybe 5 minutes, and all the videos raise a litany of questions about who this person is, what she has done, where she is right now, and why she did it. How you go about finding answers to those questions is completely up to you. The transcripts of every interview this woman has given while in custody are searchable within the database. You can type in any word or series of words this woman may have said at any point during the interview process, and the database will give you clips of any interviews in which she said those words. For example, typing in the word “husband” will return a clip in which she talks about meeting, marrying, and possibly fighting with her husband. When she mentions her husband by name, typing in his name will lead you to another set of clips, in which she might mention the suspicion that he may have cheated on her, which might lead you to type in “cheat” or “affair.” Some clips may include more clues than others, which is why you can use the note-taking system for each clip to type in a free-form note and keep your thoughts organized during the search. This is recursive Wikipedia-search detective work at its most meaningful and interesting. The system wouldn’t have been terribly out of place in any number of laughable, Digital Pictures-quality full-motion-video games from the early 90s, yet the ambitions at play here overshadow all of those former attempts. The game depends entirely on player curiosity to drive the broken narrative forward, asking you to take a big risk in trusting that the truth is actually out there. It’s entirely possibly to get stuck on a string of minutiae, forgetting a key phrase and winding up hopelessly lost. If a “game over” is to be had, it comes from simply losing one’s way through the narrative. It’s relatively simple to do, especially if you're not entirely invested from the beginning. That said, virtually all the answers are in the interviews if you’re tenacious and observant. No one clip is the linchpin to the whole thing, though the big revelations are there, and a rather out-of-place chat program acts as a sort of ersatz signal that you’ve seen the clips necessary to say, “Pat, I’d like to solve the puzzle.” The signal doesn’t necessarily mean that you should stop looking, however. You won’t necessarily want to stop looking, either. The woman--played wonderfully by Viva Siefert--isn’t necessarily on the defensive as much as willfully omitting what becomes painfully, coldly obvious from a simple slip of the tongue or an uneasy body movement. When the truth finally leaves her lips, it comes with such a preternatural calm for something that should set off alarm bells for anyone else watching, which makes the character and the performance even more affecting. Each layer of the mystery you’ve managed to peel away and witness and each struck nerve breaks this woman’s carefully crafted quilt of lies down to a series of frightening frayed ends. Game director Sam Barlow was responsible for the terrific Silent Hill: Shattered Memories a few years ago, and even though Her Story contains no eldritch, sword-wielding horrors, or disfigured mannequins, this game has a kindred feeling with the best entries in that series. Through our own curiosity we listen to this woman speak, her honesty treading on every day, deep-seated feelings about menial life, her parents, sex, social responsibilities, and the kind of seething resentment that causes people to do terrible things when they think no one’s watching. Just because it never shifts towards the supernatural doesn’t mean it doesn’t inspire something quietly distressing when hearing someone else tell it. If anything, Her Story is more distressing because these feelings are familiar; we experience the same distress hearing the friends and neighbors of the world’s worst people describe them as quiet and keeping to themselves. We have an intimate level of knowledge about this woman in the wake of her own personal tragedy, and the strength of Her Story as a narrative experience is that even as the right clips put the truth in sharp relief, your ability to uncover it is both satisfying and horrifying. This feat of intelligence and insight sticks with you long after the credits roll."
1620,"Invisible, Inc.",7.0,2,"When I was growing up, I always found myself surrounded by kids who wanted to be James Bond. Being at that age where you start to recognize things as being cool right around the time The Living Daylights and License To Kill happened probably had a little to do with that, but, really, shooting bad guys, playing high stakes card games, quaffing martinis, beautiful women going in and out of the bedroom's revolving doors--all of this has a universal, immortal appeal. While I'm not made of stone, and certainly know suave and seductive when I see it, I never wanted to be Bond. I wanted to be M. I wanted to be the guy who had been doing the dirt, and doing it well for so long that he got to order dudes like Bond around, moving conspirators, double agents, and sensitive information around the globe as if he were engaged in a game of chess. I always imagined being the guy to scream into a microphone, ""You've got the files, now get the hell out of there."" For that reason alone, Invisible, Inc. now owns a tiny piece of my heart. It's a tactical, turn-based stealth espionage game where I am the eyes of God, looking down on the isometric, randomly generated playing field. There's infinite time to plot out my spies' every move and observe the guards' reactions before completing the mission, ordering the spies to make a beeline for an extraction point, and beaming them out. The game recalls XCOM in in the way a fallen spy succumbs to permanent death, and in its randomly generated levels; few stealth games are this slick, and even fewer are unwilling to sacrifice any opportunity for tension or raised stakes to make its hero look cooler. Here, the silent, invisible completion of the mission is all that matters, and the stakes are too high to waste time grandstanding. The situation: It's the distant future, and after years of digging up serious dirt on the megacorporations of the new world, the titular spy agency is raided, forcing the chief, her two best agents, and Incognita--their all-encompassing JARVIS.-style AI--to go on the run. You start off with just the two agents, with a maximum of four active at a time (10 total are coming as downloadable content down the road), and your overall mission is to gather enough expendable resources to strike back at your enemies within 72 hours. This is the point where the portable version of Incognita loses power. Sadly, the telling of the story is reduced to well-written but sparse lip service after the fully-animated intro, but it's less of a problem once you realize how carefully considered your actions in every subsequent mission have to be. From your jet, you have to infiltrate various corporations around the globe. Sometimes it's to get new confidential info out of a corporate facility; sometimes you have to hack into an executive's mind and fend off his private security while waiting to download the goods; sometimes it's just to get your hands on some brand new spy toys. The thing is, virtually everything is a resource. Aside from the expected mechanics of a tactical role-playing game--moving around and carrying objects are governed by quantifiable stats (movement points and inventory space) you must wisely invest in--you also have a security level that rises steadily with every turn, and each trip around the wheel, an obstacle appears to make your life a little harder, be it new armored guards, or a security protocol that makes hacking a greater danger. Until much later in the game, ambushing and knocking out a guard typically involves using electrical, non-lethal means which, because you're not operating out of an agency, have limited uses. Guns make things easier, but while guards and robot drones are always packing heat, ammo is a seriously rare commodity. There's a shot you can buy to Pulp Fiction a fallen agent back from the dead, and a very limited option to rewind a bad move (an option that becomes negligible at higher difficulties); otherwise, a dead agent is a dead agent. Occasionally, agents survive, and the enemy takes them hostage. You can potentially set out on rescue missions, which appear later in the game, but that involves hours you don't necessarily have, because jetsetting around the planet costs more time than you think, depending on the distance to your mission. If Incognita goes bye-bye, or if all your agents are dead, guess what? Game over. You're starting from the beginning. The upshot is that this isn't so tricky a proposition, since a player comfortable with the relatively simple setup can blow through the game, good ending or bad, in about four to five hours. But this isn't a game like many role-playing games of its ilk where there are pawns to sacrifice for the sake of letting someone charge some special maneuver, or to absorb a bullet while other soldiers move around. If you move a spy around, you have to consider every possible outcome of both your move and the reactions of the guards around the facility, because being wrong will cost time and life. Taking your time and playing smarter, not harder, grants missions a pleasant clockwork precision, with every agent in the field working in tandem towards a common goal--and that goal is ""attack"" far less often than in a typical spy game. The flaws are all in the execution. The facilities your agents infiltrate are busy enough, with movement grids, wireframe scans that Incognita can hack, and vision cones from all the cameras and guards in the vicinity. Add in the random industrial trash scattered around, and the never-quite-right camera angles, and there are times when the screen is just total chaos. Enemy AI is rather typical for a stealth game, where the same guard can range from implausibly obtuse (why didn't that guard open fire the second he saw me duck into a hiding spot instead of announcing to nobody, ""I'm gonna investigate""?) to trigger-happy sharpshooters who can shoot the hair off your eyebrows from two rooms away in a matter of minutes. Like many stealth games, Invisible Inc.'s systems--several types of vision cones, night-vision goggles, and so forth--provide explanations for highly game-ish behaviors, but those behaviors don't necessarily adhere to the logic of human nature.   The biggest problem is the simple fact that while the ticking clocks in and out of the actual espionage provide a nice anxious framework for the game, the story in between is a letdown. Missions are often interchangeable, with the same briefing used for multiple stages with the same objective across the board; the between-stage dialogue, while sharp, doesn't exactly tell the same escalating story as the gameplay. Luckily, the gameplay sings, making for a game that's not as powerful as it could be, but undeniably accessible. The random levels contribute to the joy, meaning no experience is ever truly repeated, and each stage's relative brevity and array of objective types makes it rather light and breezy while still maintaining a measure of depth. It's not quite the patient MI6 power fantasy I had in mind as a kid, but it's close. It's a fine, unique, strategic experience that has occasional frustrating glimmers of the possibly of being something more. Then again, every great spy story is contingent on people not letting people know or care about ""something more,"" isn't it?"
1886,Dance Central Spotlight,8.0,2,"Rock Band sequels were products of a rhythm game arms race, each installment growing heavier with added features and increased track counts, then Dance Central Spotlight is a move in the opposite direction. Here, Harmonix has pared its stylish Kinect dancing franchise down to its most essential elements, ditching the time-traveling story mode of Dance Central 3 in favor of a renewed focus on the dance routines that sit at the very heart of the game. But it's slimmed down in other ways, too, with a $10 core game serving as the gateway to a musical storefront brimming with reasonably priced songs to build out your own customized library. What's left is a lean but immensely enjoyable dancing game, one that goes out of its way to remove the barriers between you and shaking it on the dance floor. Dance Central Spotlight is more akin to a downloadable starter pack than a full retail product. The core game comes with 10 songs, a genre-spanning assortment of recent hits that ranges from the soulful pop of Lorde's ""Royals"" to the infectious house rhythm of David Guetta's ""Titanium."" Every one of these songs carries on Dance Central's tradition of excellent choreography, with inventive dance routines and lively animations bringing each song to life. But where Dance Central Spotlight differs from its predecessors is in the amount of content each song provides.   several steps. See, every song in the game now offers that same primary routine with four difficulty settings, but now you also get two alternate routines as well as much more strenuous cardio and strength exercise routines. These aren't mere variations; they're entirely different dance numbers. As a result, each song has become its own rabbit hole of grooving and shaking, giving you an enormous incentive to dive right back in as soon as the music's over so that you can continue to experience those new moves. That said, the dancing itself is the same as ever. You follow cue cards scrolling along the screen, attempting to mirror the game's impossibly hip assortment of playable characters as they shimmy and shake in various ways. No matter how well you do, it's tough not to find a smile creeping across your face. From the vivid presentation to the consistently outstanding choreography, the simple act of dancing makes Dance Central Spotlight some of the purest fun you can have on an Xbox One. But there is one irksome quality to the game's tried-and-true formula. Do well and you'll see the screen explode in a fireworks display of light and color, with score combos and star ratings going out of their way to tell you just how hard you're nailing it. But botch a move and all you get is a red outline on your character's limbs--the same feedback system that's been used since day one. That minimalist feedback has always been nice because of how non-invasive it is, allowing you to keep having a blast even if you happen to be making a real hash of Rihanna's latest single. But in Dance Central Spotlight, it's a bit at odds with itself. That's because Dance Central Spotlight's progression system requires you to unlock new dance routines by collecting flawless performances on various dance moves. Generally speaking, this system is pretty forgiving; there are so many dance moves to collect that you never really hit a brick wall in terms of progression. But in those instances where a trickier dance move just doesn't click with you, it's hard to tell exactly what you're doing wrong. Nonetheless, other improvements to the dancing experience ease the process of learning new moves. Now you can pause mid-song and jump into a quick practice mode, running through a move over and over again--even slowing it down if you prefer--until you feel comfortable with it. Once you've got it, you can pick up right where you left off. No need to jump out to the main menu and launch a separate practice mode. In fact, Dance Central Spotlight is pretty light on extraneous game modes altogether. There is a neat little fitness mode that lets you design a custom playlist of routine types, set the overall length of your dance session, and then see how many calories you've burned according to your height and weight. But beyond that, there's the song store and little else. But even without the delightfully silly story mode and assorted minigames of its predecessor, Dance Central Spotlight's core offering still delivers a tremendous value. For a mere $10, you get an album's worth of songs that all feature five distinct routines to learn. What's nice is that each song you buy from the store--which run for $2 each, with some bundles offering a small discount--also offer the same generous assortment of choreographies. So whether you end up spending another $10 or $40, the library you assemble gives you plenty of ways to shake it while simultaneously reflecting your own musical tastes. Indeed, Dance Central Spotlight feels like an admission that sometimes you just can't be all things to all people. Rather than beef up the feature list, Harmonix has taken the opposite approach: it's slimmed down the game, offered way more value, and removed the obstacles between you and just getting out there and dancing. It's a different take on Dance Central, but the party is just as fun as ever."
4157,The Sims 2: Pets,4.0,0,"  Thanks to Nintendogs, pet simulators have entered the mainstream. People love them, probably because they simulate the experience of having a pet without requiring the time and effort that real animals do, and they don't make you clean up nasty accidents either. Electronic Arts' entry into the pet-raising genre is The Sims 2: Pets, which is available for numerous systems, including the Nintendo DS. What's interesting about the DS version of the game is that it casts players into the role of veterinarian and places a greater emphasis on the care and grooming of animals. That's quite a focus shift from the other versions, which incorporate pets and pet-related jobs into the traditional humanoid sim blueprint. You'd think, then, that the DS game would deliver the superior pet-rearing experience, since it lets players spend more time interacting with their animals and less time doing silly tasks like holding a job or hanging out with other sims. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out that way. While you do get plenty of opportunities to interact with a menagerie of cats and dogs, the number of different options available during those interactions is rather limited. At the same time, the animals themselves don't display much in the way of personality or playfulness in response to your efforts.        Everything starts out on the right foot. After you pick out a human sim and select an accompanying pet from a list of cats and dogs, you'll find yourself standing in the middle of a small house that's been converted into a vet's office. Your sim and its pet both have needs that you need to monitor and take care of. You'll have to tell your sim to use the bathroom, to take showers, to sit down, and to cook and eat food. For your sim's pet, you'll have to tell the sim to feed it, give it a bath, groom it, and take it to the park for play and exercise. The controls make use of the touch screen extensively, such that you usually only need to tap an object twice to make your sim do something. Time moves more quickly in the game than it does in reality, but it only takes a minute or two to tend to the needs of your Sim and its pet each day. You'll spend much more time playing the role of veterinarian. Other sims are constantly bringing their cats and dogs to you, and you have to diagnose and treat their illnesses and provide various grooming services. When the owners come back to pick up their pets, they'll pay you money and sing your praises to others. Ultimately, the goal is to become a renowned vet and use the money you earn to expand the house and fill it with the best gadgets and furniture money can buy.     Once you've spent a couple of in-game days keeping your Sim happy and caring for animals, boredom begins to set in as you realize that you're constantly doing the same limited set of actions over and over again. To diagnose an animal, you take it over to the table and rub it, brush it, or look it over with the stethoscope and X-ray until the game tells you what the problem is. To treat an animal, you simply need to feed it the proper medicine, bandage it up, or take it over to the bathing or grooming stations. All of these actions require that you grab and manipulate tools using the touch screen, but the process isn't so interesting when you end up doing the same four or five tasks constantly. As it is, animals in the game only ever come down with one of five unique maladies. Going for a walk or playing with a pet is slightly more enjoyable, since you can pick out a toy to play with or choose a trick to see, but even then you're limited to a small selection of toys and tricks. Basically, none of the game's interactive aspects are as fleshed out as they should be.        The incessant repetition wouldn't be so bad if the atmosphere was upbeat or if the animals were fun to watch. The atmosphere, however, isn't upbeat. It's dull, and the cats and dogs are about as lively as a pet that's just woken up from a midday nap. On the technical side, the game puts the system's 3D abilities to work generating the house, the park, and all of the trees and furniture situated within those environments. Nothing really moves in the environment, though, except for the people and animals, and they don't move much to begin with. Sims will throw tantrums if you let one of their needs go for too long. Otherwise, they just walk from one spot to the next and wave occasionally. If you have your sim take a shower, for instance, they'll just get in and step out after a few seconds. There's no elaborate flourish of water and scrubbing like you'd see in one of the regular The Sims games. By the same token, the animals look cute and furry, and have big, expressive eyes, but they hardly do much but wag their tails and wander about halfheartedly. The kitties and pooches in The Sims 2: Pets definitely do not jump and frolic like the dogs in Nintendogs do.      There aren't enough sound effects to go around, either. For all of the 20 different animals, there are only a few different purr, bark, and meow noises, which are heard sparingly. Your human Sim will also speak up and utter some gibberish when they're talking to another Sim or they're annoyed by something. Mostly, though, you're stuck listening to the knockoff elevator music that's always playing in the background.     It's nice that The Sims 2: Pets incorporates some veterinary aspects that we haven't seen in other pet-care games. Beyond that, however, it's limited, it's repetitive, and it lacks the heart that a game in the genre really must have to appeal to the kind of person that's looking for this sort of game.  "
1776,Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U,9.0,2," At its most basic level, Smash Bros. is what you’d get if you built a game on the premise of settling the classic question, “I wonder who’d win in a fight: Mario or Link?” You and your opponents choose whichever character you like from Nintendo’s staggering roster of 49 fighters and enter the fray. Damage works in a unique and slightly obtuse way. In stark contrast with most fighting games, you don’t have a limited pool of health that depletes as you take damage. Instead, your health counts upwards, and the more hits you take, the further you're sent flying when hit again. The goal of any given match is to knock your opponents off the stage and prevent them from safely returning.               "
1767,JUJU,6.0,1,"Super Mario Bros. games but for one reason or another would never dream of investing in the hardware required to play them, you might want to take a look at Juju. It's a platformer that carries you through four vibrant worlds, forcing you to bop and bash a bunch of cute enemies while riding on the backs of dinosaurs, collecting trinkets, and finding hidden bonus areas, much like Mario might. With the exception of the Rayman games, there aren't a lot of options for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 that capture the joy of two-dimensional platforming. Juju doesn't do that consistently, either, but it has its moments. Sometimes things even come together well enough that you'd swear you've been deposited in the Mushroom Kingdom. Perhaps the game's biggest problem is that it seems to be working to evoke that particular response rather than to establish a consistent and engaging identity of its own. An introductory cutscene shows two young mammals are playing outside when a wise old bear walks past them on his way to what looks like an Incan pyramid. The youngsters follow him, darting behind trees to avoid detection. They watch as their elder sticks his staff in a pedestal slot and communes with the translucent images of four distant planets. He is interrupted by a little bird that seeks his help, so he descends to the nearby forest. That distraction gives the kids a chance to mess with the staff. Their meddling releases a giant bat and a bunch of bees and assorted pests. Before long, the kindly old bear is abducted, the world is overrun by malicious wildlife, and a little pink bear with a magic mask--one of the two responsible for the mess in the first place--must reassemble the staff by journeying to the four mysterious planets. Juju takes place almost entirely in these four themed worlds. Each one consists of around eight action stages, along with two boss encounters. Individual stages don't feature a timer, just a goal at the end where you can stop a spinning wheel to collect a prize before returning to the world hub to select the next stage. Areas are littered with the game's equivalent of coins or rings, and you earn medals based on how many of them you gather and how many bonus stages you find and clear. The pink bear cub you control is a relatively weak heroine as the game begins but strong enough to get the job done thanks to the assistance of her magic mask. Mini-boss encounters add additional skills to her repertoire so that, by the end of the game, she is butt-bouncing, hover-jumping, and tossing explosive balls at an increasingly tough group of nasty critters. She often must pause and start banging on her drum, as well, which opens up the path ahead or distracts enemies long enough that they can be defeated. This is one of the game's few attempts to do something genuinely different, but it mostly falls flat because it's just a hassle. You press and hold a button for a few seconds when prompted by a situation, and that's the extent of it. More than anything, it breaks up the pace that the game might have established at that point. Early on, Juju is rather dull. Exploring the sparsely populated introductory world feels more like a chore than an adventure, and the background artwork--though detailed nicely in the Unreal engine--is too generic to be interesting. Checkpoints are frequent, and the threat from enemies is minimal, so players of all ages should have little difficulty progressing to the end of each stage. However, subsequent worlds are a great deal livelier. By the time they reach the third and fourth planets, the player will need to pay attention to progress and will be rewarded for doing so with some of the most vibrant artwork that the game offers. The aforementioned bonus stages provide an additional incentive to explore every nook and cranny, but they're not cleverly hidden. Typically, the player need only rush toward an obviously placed large wall, and part of it will pull away to reveal a magical gate. Bonus areas come in only a few configurations throughout the game, and thus get tedious quickly. Some of them are surprisingly easy to fail until you've practiced a lot, and you only get a single shot at them unless you drop into a pit or something on purpose and try again from the last checkpoint. Because the bonus stages are so repetitive and even a little frustrating, they feel like a waste of time and not the reward they might have been. Bosses serve as another stumbling point. You encounter most of them twice. First, they appear as mini-bosses with one pattern. For instance, you encounter a toad, and you have to get him to swallow stinging bees so that he harms himself and flees the scene. Then you face the same foe, which now has learned a few new tricks, at the end of a given planet. Most of the bosses are difficult to defeat, serving as an abrupt spike in difficulty that could leave younger players out in the cold. The final boss in particular provides a hefty challenge. It's by no means insurmountable, and older players should be able to persevere after two or three attempts and some attack pattern memorization, but these oversized antagonists are a bit much for the younger set. That's a shame, because kids are the obvious audience for Juju.The young heroine doesn't provide much for adults to identify with, and the overly cute adversaries feel like they belong in children's television programming. It's easy to appreciate the vibrant visuals regardless of age (though not the lengthy load times preceding each stage), but that's probably not enough to keep your attention over the course of a four- to five-hour campaign. There is a good way of bridging the generational gap, however: Juju lets a second player drop in and out at any time. Two people can work together to snag all of the loot, which makes bonus stages easier, and to find all of the secrets. They do have to stay fairly close together, since the camera isn't willing to pull back very far (players temporarily drop out of sight if they stray too far apart), but it works. There's no worry about running out of lives, either, meaning the cooperative experience is a positive net experience in spite of a few hitches. With Juju, the developers at Flying Wild Hog have cobbled together a charming adventure that never surpasses its inspiration but still manages to provide a generally inoffensive romp through gorgeous fantasy worlds. Unfortunate difficulty spikes may keep some youngsters at bay, and the repetition is discouraging regardless of your age, but there's still some innate appeal to this cute and competent platformer, which gets the job done with minimal fuss."
2467,Mass Effect 3,9.0,2,"  The horrid creature standing before you might be a disgusting monstrosity, but you once spared this beast's entire species from annihilation. Do you do so once more, and risk losing a valued squad members and a crucial alliance? Or do you allow an even greater threat to destroy it--effectively committing genocide--so you might make a speedy exit, even though this creature's assistance could turn the tide of a vital galactic battle? In Mass Effect 3, such choices loom large, and not simply because there are many of factors to consider. Your actions often guide the course of events to come, sometimes in ways that see the loss of those nearest and dearest to your heart.     Mass Effect and its sequel, and how close you've grown to the inhabitants of their irresistible universe. This is the first time this role-playing/shooter hybrid series has appeared on a Nintendo console, and it's possible you haven't played a Mass Effect game before. If so, you're at a disadvantage: without a connection to the wonderful characters that have already crossed the playable hero's path, you may place less weight on their ultimate fates. Yet even without that previous connection, it's hard not to be drawn to your comrades in arms. Every character leaps off the screen, thanks to top-notch voice acting and great facial animations that effectively communicate the sting of sorrow and the rush of victory.      Nevertheless, leaping blindly into the final installment of a beloved trilogy requires a degree of faith, and the game at least allows newcomers to catch up on the spacefaring series' plot developments via an interactive comic that has you making a number of decisions that determine the state of the universe prior to beginning the game proper. The attractive comic covers key plot points, and benefits from an outstanding narration. And while it's no substitute for dozens of hours' worth of dramatic storytelling and exciting gameplay, the comic gets the job done as well as could be expected.      Whether or not you're new to the series, it's hard not to be taken in by Mass Effect 3's narrative. You play as the customizable Commander Shepard, galactic hero and star of the first two games. Galactic tensions are high: a sentient race of starships known as reapers are eager to harvest organic species and turn their vibrant planetary homes into lifeless husks. After a short exposition, an opening combat scenario cleverly combines the ""big"" of a reaper attack on Earth with the ""small"" of a single death. While there is plenty of action, the game continually subverts expectation. Every so often, the shooting heats up, only to lead to a climax that comes not in the form of an explosion or a boss fight, but in a simple quiet conversation, or a few limping steps.       The reapers aren't your only adversary in Mass Effect 3: the pro-human organization known as Cerberus, led by the Illusive Man, complicates the conflict. Your ultimate goal is to rid the galaxy of the reaper threat with the use of a superweapon, yet the Illusive Man has different ideas and goes to some disturbing lengths to implement them. Discovering his goals and means is one of Mass Effect 3's better story threads, in part because the Illusive Man is such a strong presence. Actor Martin Sheen brings a calm, chilling strength to the character, but also exudes a touch of vulnerability when the Illusive Man is forced to confront his own demons.      Much has already been made of Mass Effect 3's controversial finale, so you should note that the Special Edition incorporates the Extended Cut ending, which closes some holes left open when the game was originally released on other platforms. And even if you feel ambivalent toward its ending, Mass Effect 3 is hardly lacking in memorable moments. The choices you make during story scenes using the game's dialogue wheel have dramatic implications, and entire quests, conversations, and characters shift as a result of your actions. Other consequences are less sweeping but still emotionally affecting; a lover might fondly recall her previous entanglement with you, while still supporting your new romantic interest, for instance.      As a result, you might be delighted by characters other players never meet, share intimate talks with crewmates other players never interact with, and deal with decisions other players never make. Your entire attitude, governed by Mass Effect 3's morality system (paragon versus renegade) when choosing dialogue options, can drive you to conclusions other players could never consider. Rising personal tensions are enhanced by the game's ominous visual identity. A raging storm encroaches, giving battle an even greater sense of urgency. The sheer darkness of a subterranean ruin enhances the sense of danger. The art is effective, with touches of blue and crimson contrasting the cool apathy of space with the passions of its fearful residents. The Wii U release holds up rather well against the others, with only a few frame rate dips and less-saturated colors sullying an otherwise fluid and attractive experience.       Mass Effect 3 packs in plenty of excitement between story developments. The action plays out as a typical third-person cover shooter, with special tech and biotic powers livening up the core shooting. Mass Effect 3 provides a huge supply of guns and weapon modifications. There are five weapon types and loads of choices within those types, each with its own pros and cons. You find weapons and mods in mission areas and can purchase them from vendors on the space station known as the Citadel or from a terminal on your ship, the Normandy SR-2. You don't just need to consider your play style when choosing weapons prior to battle--you also need to consider how their weight might affect your ability to perform biotic and tech skills. The heavier your loadout, the less often you can send the bad guys flying into the air.      And boy is it ever fun to toss the bad guys skyward, though that isn't the only fancy skill you can perform. You might sprint and tumble about, sliding into cover and using cryo ammo to freeze a creepy cannibal before charging into it and smashing it to pieces. Or perhaps you would rather send a powerful shock wave careening toward oncoming troopers, flinging them over a facility's railing and into the abyss beneath. As you level up, you eventually make choices about how to upgrade your powers. For instance: do you increase the Pull ability's recharge speed, or do you learn to launch two Pull projectiles at once? Don't assume that Mass Effect 3's missions are all about guns and space magic, though. A pistol isn't much help when you traverse a virtual space made of neon cubes and floating platforms.        On most occasions, you're joined by up to two other squadmates of your choosing, who have their own powers to perform. While you can pull off these skills by pulling up a radial menu (which pauses the action), you can also tap corresponding icons on the Wii U's tablet. The tablet interface can require a bit of pre-mission maintenance, especially if you switch out squadmates every so often, because there are a limited number of icon slots, and you must manually assign them. This micromanagement can be a chore, but using the tablet in this manner improves the experience overall, because you can utilize your squad's powers in tactically efficient ways without ever pausing the game. The benefit to the action's pacing is immense.     You can also use the tablet to manually position your cohorts, though doing so is laborious and rarely useful. But even if you do make use of the possibilities of manual squad positioning, your cronies show off their general lack of intelligence by crouching on top of crates, and your foes thoughtlessly tumble against walls rather than sliding into safer positions. Other minor flaws include camera angles going awry, weird cover system quirks, and a journal that doesn't always fill in important details.      Yet the action rarely suffers when the faults emerge, due to Mass Effect 3's varied level design. While there are times when cover is laid out in predictable ways and adversaries emerge as you expect them to, some expansive combat areas and aggressive enemy types give rise to diverse pacing. Shrieking banshees can destroy you in a single grab if you let them come too close, and hulking brutes constantly threaten to intrude on your personal space. In tandem, they create memorable, challenging combat sequences that require you to intelligently use the surrounding space to minimize danger.       Mass Effect 3 isn't all talking and shooting. Outside of combat, you walk around the Citadel, picking up odd jobs and eavesdropping on diplomats and refugees. There are some wonderful moments to experience here: having a bizarre conversation with a virtual copy of yourself, checking in on an old ally in bad health, and punching an old nemesis square in the face. Refugees mourn the lost and missing, gazing at a collection of photographs that serves as an ad hoc memorial. It's the subtleties that pull you in. A crewmate gets a tattoo to celebrate his newfound ambitions, you ponder the meaning of a human-on-AI romance, and you grab a drink in a busy nightclub. It's a pity that the entertaining lesser races--the Hanar and the Elcor in particular--are in such short supply. Mass Effect 3 isn't big on comedic interludes.     The side missions you pick up at the Citadel aren't all that inspired. In some cases, you wander around searching for objects to interact with. In others, you head to the Normandy and take to the galactic map. You zoom about the galaxy from a top-down view, scanning solar regions to identify planets of interest. From here, you scan the planet itself, drop a probe onto its surface, and collect the artifact or object in question. This busywork is complicated by reapers, who appear in these solar systems after a few seconds and swarm and destroy you if you don't make a swift escape. This game of cat and mouse is more annoying than entertaining, getting in the way when you wish you could just get the job done.   Leviathan and Omega, are not included here, making this special edition not as special as it might have been.       Yet even without that additional content, you couldn't rightfully accuse Mass Effect 3 of feeling incomplete--not with so many missions to undertake, so many individuals to engage in conversation, so many choices to make. If you haven't yet had the opportunity to spend time with some of the Milky Way's most intriguing personalities, now is your chance. Just be prepared: bonds can be broken and ties can be severed. When your goal is no less than ensuring the survival of an entire galaxy, sacrifice is inevitable, and Mass Effect 3 makes sure you feel each and every one.     "
1872,The Golf Club,6.0,1," The Golf Club is a pure simulation, all about recreating the game itself. This is golf, golf, and golf, in that order., so anyone coming to this game from the Tiger Woods series will be shocked at the absence of frills. There is no PGA support, there are no pro golfers, and there aren't any gimmicks like being able to golf with toddler Tiger Woods or shooting targets on a driving range. You take on rounds in stroke play, match play, or four ball. Matches can be played solo, against other live players, or against ghosts, which allows you to see the past shots of other players (and yourself in previous rounds) and compete against their scores without the delays of waiting for these rivals to hit their balls. Tournaments are also available, as are player-created tours linking multiple tournies and courses.          "
2031,Infested Planet,8.0,2,"A squad of gun-toting space marines? A distant world that needs conquering? A teeming mass of deadly alien wildlife that's hell-bent on eating the faces of anyone who meddles in their business? At a glance, Infested Planet appears too concerned about checking off boxes in the dusty old sci-fi cliches playbook for its own good, but well-balanced and absorbing gameplay overshadow those expected elements. On paper, the overplayed ""let's stomp some alien bugs with our big machine guns"" routine fails to excite. Beneath its generic exoskeleton, however, the challenging mix of real-time strategy base management and tower-defense strategy found in this slick-looking game packs serious heat.        "
3440,Victoria II,8.0,2,"  The sun may never have set on the British Empire of the 19th century, but it is finally starting to rise on the Victoria series of grand strategy games. Paradox Interactive's sequel to its buggy and confusing 2003 game about nation building during the Industrial Age has been well worth the wait. Victoria II dumps most of the bugs, fussy micromanagement, and headache-inducing complexity that earned the original game a lot of criticism. In their place is a (mainly) stable game with kinder, gentler mechanics that eliminate most of the finicky tedium while leaving you at the helm of the ship of state. There's also an intuitive interface and a series of comprehensive tutorials that teach you the game's fundamentals. This still isn't a walk in the park, as hours of experimentation are necessary before you get comfortable with statecraft in the 1800s. But it is the game that Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun should have been, and it is both playable and addictive once you get past the initial steep learning curve.      Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron. This is a geopolitical simulation writ large, where you take control of the state of your choosing at the dawn of the Victorian era in 1836 and guide it in real time for a century. The solo game is the primary way to play (there is just the single grand campaign option here), although there is multiplayer support for the truly hardcore who have many hours to spend dealing and dueling with LAN/online rivals. Most of the game comprises map screens detailing hundreds of nations and thousands of provinces (with fairly dated, yet still credible board game-styled visuals--although the text is now microscopic when playing at higher resolutions over 1680x1050). There are also menu lists that cover every aspect of Victorian society, including population, religion, trade, taxation, diplomacy, warfare, and the many technological advancements of the era. Ruling a state involves tricky balancing acts, where you play off things like the taxes and tariffs needed for a country to pay the bills against the desire of the great unwashed to keep a few shillings in their pockets for luxury items. You also have to balance the gradual demand for societal reform against the conservative desire for everything to stay the same. If you go too far in either direction, you wind up with an unhappy populace that might revolt.     All of these complicated factors are put together quite well. Where the original Victoria was little more than a shoebox full of random scraps and ideas, its successor feels like a properly planned-out game. You notice this as soon as the main menu loads up; the game now offers a fairly complete series of tutorials that walk you through the interface and most of the situations that you will encounter in the real grand Campaign mode. The new interface is also a godsend. All of the core features of your nation are accessed via eight buttons on an information bar at the top left of the screen. So if you want to tweak diplomacy, adjust tax rates, order technological improvements, or field an army, all you do is click a single button to access the requisite menus, and then, you can have at it.        Making changes is also a snap for the most part. You deal with slider bars for things like taxation and tech trees for technological innovations like railroads and assembly lines. It's still more than a little scary at first because you are hit with formidable lists of policy initiatives and no firm idea how they will affect your nation until you start experimenting (in-game cabinet advisors providing tips could have been very helpful). The politics screen alone boasts dozens of choices where you can do just about everything, such as outlawing trade unions, OK'ing slavery, and changing voting rights so that the rich get more of a say in elections. Despite the number of options, though, you can gradually figure out how moves will change the structure of your nation. All of the necessary information is at your fingertips, albeit in the form of pie charts and various stat columns.     Getting into a grand strategy solo game can be an addictive experience, too, at least after you've gone through a few test runs with games you don't expect to finish. Matches are complex, although you can automate fussy features, such as trade (which is so complicated that it seems just about impossible to deal with it manually). Population is the biggest concept to wrap your head around. The game comes with classes and a dozen or so occupations that all need to be carefully managed. You have to delve into the nitty-gritty quite often to maintain a balance, making sure that each group of citizens has access to employment, can meet basic needs, and has access to luxury goods. This isn't nearly as painstaking as it was in the first Victoria, thankfully, because now you're more of a hands-off leader who nudges citizens in the right direction by encouraging specific occupations and products, courtesy of things like setting national focus. Demands rise over time, of course, to reflect the progressive liberalism and the rise in the standard of living of the Industrial Age. You have to watch a number of stats here, mainly making sure that the national consciousness that governs how citizens demand reforms and the militancy that dictates how badly people want to take to the streets both grow at no more than a slow and steady pace.        Not surprisingly, it can be very tough to keep people happy for long. When things go well, they tend to go really well. You can readily settle into long periods of stable growth, issuing periodic reforms, making the economy hum along, and even taking a middle power up the ladder to compete with the big boys like Great Britain and France all while listening to the sedate classical soundtrack of the 19th-century's greatest hits. But revolts take place too often, with the people demanding reforms as the years go by and you being unable to issue them because of the power of the ""stay the course"" conservatives in the upper house of your government. Expect big trouble after 1860, with all of the brewing unrest often exploding into massive revolts of communists, reactionaries, Jacobites, and pals. This doesn't happen all the time, however. Some games roll along without a hitch, while others see nation after nation descending into chaos with revolutionaries rioting in every province. Modders have been working on solutions already, so perhaps Paradox will take note and issue a patch sometime soon. Yet even with the revolt annoyance, there are remarkably few ""How do I do this?"" and ""How the hell did that happen?"" moments here. Only the odd desktop crash hints at a tiny bit of instability.     While it isn't revolutionary enough to win over those who have found Paradox's grand-strategy efforts too grueling in the past, Victoria II is a more accessible version of this demanding style of game. That said, this remains a challenging, intricate experience that won't be for everyone. It still hits you with a learning curve that initially looks like the north face of K2 to the newbie who has never played this sort of game before. The revolt issue is also frustrating when it pops up, especially because it generally does so after you've invested a few decades into a campaign. Still, this is a leap forward from its predecessor, and it does show that Paradox has been listening to its critics and is tying to make its games as mainstream as possible without turning off the hardcore historical strategy fans that are the company's bread and butter.  "
2107,Huntsman: The Orphanage,6.0,1,"Huntsman: The Orphanage prompts many questions. Who is the huntsman? How did 12 orphans vanish without a trace from a rural Illinois orphanage in 1897? For that matter, where can I pick up that sweet smartphone that talks to the dead and never loses a charge? Huntsman doesn't answer all of these questions, but some of its chief pleasures lie in rummaging among old suitcases and piles of dusty prosthetics for clues to the answers. When paired with its creepy namesake, it's a premise that manages to deliver some genuine chills, but it's not long before its web of creepypasta stories ensnare you more than any sense of dread. That's both a blessing and a curse. ShadowShifters, the studio behind the project, created a game that frightens more by ambience than with the jump scares, blood, and violence that define many horror games (and movies) these days. Many of its most effective chills actually spring from the expectation of scares common in horror games that came before it, and indeed, the first tentative steps of the game lead you down a wooded road, past a phone booth, and up to the wrought iron gates of a decaying institution. A casual onlooker could be fooled into thinking you were playing through the start of Outlast. But there's no blood here, and if there were, it's had over 100 years to fade away. Perfect opportunities for jump scares present themselves and pass, and even 20 minutes into the game you might still believe that this really is just an abandoned complex in modern Illinois, and that the falling crosses and self-closing doors really do owe their existence to nothing besides the wind. By the time I came across the rare wonder of a chalkboard writing a helpful tutorial by itself, I found myself not so much spooked as grateful for the novelty. Amnesia, and most of the time you use it as a flashlight but, alas, with none of the dread that springs from losing battery power. The phone's existence comes into its own, however, when the voices and images of the 12 missing children come crackling through it, begging you to find their favorite belongings and return them to their graves so their souls can be free of the dreaded huntsman. Sometimes they interrupt you with flashes of video when you get near said items. Sometimes they pop up and tell you stories with clues from their past when you hover the phone over the portraits scattered throughout the orphanage. And in most cases, the excellent voice work for the accompanying stories makes up for some of the limitations of the surrounding visuals. Tales of chopping off hands at the woodpile suggest that these orphans aren't angelic innocents, and some of them speak with just enough hints of menace that you might balk at placating them with gifts. They don't even let up on the creepy act after you've found their junk and tossed it on their hidden graves. It's fitting that the voice work excels over so much of the rest of the experience. (If there's a drawback to this focus, it's that you have to stare at their photos the whole time to hear the full narration.) The orphans spill their lines, dropping hints based on their histories, and then you set out to dig in and around the inky-dark ruins of the orphanage to find the relevant items. It's tougher than it sounds. The relevant items don't glow or otherwise make their presence known, and since you can't interact with some of them unless you crouch or lie down, you may not even know you're looking at one even though you're staring right at it. Some of its chief pleasures lie in rummaging among old suitcases and piles of dusty prosthetics. It's here that Huntsman's overused visual assets unexpectedly come in handy. Dozens of copies of the same Dutch painting and black-and-white group photo litter the rooms of the two-story orphanage, and you grow so used to them and the sight of the same books and blue suitcases that anything else stands out in stark contrast. Good thing, too. Huntsman may be a game about exploring, thinking, and listening at heart, but on many occasions, you find the pieces just by dumb luck. It's sometimes challenging enough with the current design; it might be a nightmare in more detailed environs. Speaking of nightmares, what of the huntsman? His comparative absence in the review so far may show just how weak of an impression he tends to leave. Oh, he starts out scary enough. You see him first by the light of your phone in the enveloping darkness, with hairy arachnid legs and an upper body that looks like a steampunk dandy sporting a Renaissance plague mask, and his presence is heralded by the sound of what resembles the ticking of a dozen grandfather clocks. Knowing that this fascinating thing awaits somewhere in the dark creates much of the game's early tension. Regrettably, it's a sensation that doesn't last long. The cacophony of ticking makes him absurdly easy to avoid (particularly when paired with stereo headphones), and once I found him just staring off into space as if ruminating over his poor life choices over the last century. Even when he catches you and sucks you into limbo, the G-rated fade to black might make you wonder if the game's not simply bugging out if you didn't know better. Once you start to put the children's items back on their graves, however, the experience changes for the better. The catch is that all their graves lie scattered in a sprawling, overgrown hedge maze, and that's when you should look forward to playing in the dark with the door closed and your headphones firmly clamped on. You can always hear the tick-tocking of the huntsman, yes, but the design thrives on the realization that any wrong turn might dump you right in front of its face. With enough repetition--there are, after all, 12 children--it's possible to learn the general layout, but in those early moments, Huntsman: The Orphanage does much to live up to its horror label. Huntsman: The Orphanage does manage to convey a sense of terror in its quiet moments, but they're more benign chills than you find in bloodier horror adventures that let you fight back or at least present enemies who do more than engulf you in darkness. Its greatest frights lie in the anticipation that anything could lurk in the darkness, but once you realize that it's just you and a clockwork Spider-Man, you might find that you're no longer as afraid of the dark as you once were. And in a horror game? That's just scary."
2991,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,7.0,2,"Deus Ex, but its atmosphere and pace are unique, and this uniqueness keeps you engaged in the face of some uninviting elements. E.Y.E. is ambitious. It hands you guns, swords, and cybernetic skills, and then drops you into a chilling sci-fi world, letting you accomplish your goals in any way you see fit. It's also confusing and awkward, dropping unnecessary obstacles in your path proudly, as if to say, ""These aren't bugs; they're features!"" And so you might sometimes curse and grit your teeth, but you will also be entertained and perhaps even in awe at times. Once you've played E.Y.E., you aren't apt to forget it. Whether you remember it more for its oppressive futuristic ambience and impressive flexibility, or for how hard it works to alienate its own players, depends largely on how much patience you have.        It's a shame that E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy demands so much of that patience from the get-go. After making a series of unexplained statistical choices, you awaken on a stone walkway. Obelisks engraved with mysterious runes rise above you on either side. The sky is a yellow hue, but the darkness envelops you as you move toward the only exit you see: a shimmering door shining its turquoise light into the darkness. You're met by a figure clad in black armor, his helmet crowned with a golden halo. Like every character you meet, he speaks in a rumbling garbled language, translated into sometimes passable, sometimes broken English subtitles. After you enter the door, the first level begins--and so does the confusion. E.Y.E. introduces the first-person shooter basics during this level: how to crouch, jump, aim, shoot, and so on. What it doesn't do is teach you the important things. This is a complex game in which you hack turrets, research technology, use PSI powers, and suffer from broken limbs. And it takes a while to make sense of these mechanics. Few of these concepts are introduced in any meaningful way, and the included video tutorials are only minimally helpful.      The story is equally confusing, though enlightenment does come, at least partially. You are one of these intimidating, armor-clad sci-fi soldiers. You learn of the Federation, a conglomerate of intergalactic societies; of the Secreta Secretorum and the cold war in which its two factions are engaged; and of the conflict between your mentor and your superior. This knowledge doesn't come without effort. The dialogue doesn't always give much information, or indeed make much sense (probably due to a confusing translation from the original French). At the E.Y.E. temple, you can read up on all the backstory, which sheds light on the circumstances. But the dry accounts aren't likely to inspire any emotional connection to the tale.         You needn't know a lot of the particulars to get drawn into this world, however. Each level has a remarkable sense of place. You explore stone sanctuaries on a dusty planet's surface. You seek an important contact in a shadowy industrial zone lit by neon signs and billboards for weird television shows. A hovering dropship cuts an imposing silhouette against a neon green sky. All the while, an electronic soundtrack pulses and drones, taking the place of ambient noise in this eerily silent universe. The graphics, powered by the Source engine, aren't cutting edge. Textures are lacking, and the dim lighting is a frequent frustration, making it difficult to see important things like hidden entrances and grotesque creatures about to maul you to death. Nevertheless, the freaky language, the synthesized musical murmurs, and the orange computer terminals loaded with unintelligible text all add up to a singular and peculiar vision of the far-flung future.      The gameplay will draw you in as well, if you give it an hour or two. E.Y.E. seems like a first-person shooter at its outset, only to transform into something a lot more flexible--and a lot more intimidating if you don't take the time to experiment with its confusing array of menus. There are tons of stats to consider: agility, hacking, medicine, and psi-force among them. There are assault rifles, sniper rifles, melee weapons, and more that you can grab from armories. And you can't just load up on stuff: each item, including ammo, takes up a particular amount of space in your inventory. Among your many skills are a cloak to make you less visible to enemies; ghostly decoys to summon; and a triangulation attack that does extreme damage to your enemy, but comes with its own health risk. You can hack turrets to disable them, or even turn them against their former masters. Or maybe you'd rather snipe them and get it over with.         This is a lot to consider. But before you've gotten used to this smorgasbord of options, you're thrust into the action and discover that E.Y.E. is paced differently than most action games. Levels are large, and many objectives either send you across the map or require free exploration. As the tense atmosphere intimates, you aren't running and gunning through a horde of suicidal targets. Off the bat, you're pelted by bullets from enemies you probably didn't see through the oppressive jade mist. You learn to tread carefully and take advantage of all those cyberpowers lined up in the labyrinthine menus. Activate your cloak and sneak past, if you must. Peer down the sights of your sniper rifle and assassinate targets before they get the chance to do so first. Close to death? Convert dropped ammo and weapons into health. As you skulk through claustrophobic sewers or hide from a gunship raining death on you from above, you encounter a number of interesting enemies--some humanoid, some not. They aren't bright foes; you won't see any clever use of cover or tactical flanking. The AI does cheat, however, with all enemies in a certain radius becoming keenly aware of your presence whether or not you are in their line of sight.        Fortunately, E.Y.E. gives you the right tools for the job, which minimizes any initial frustration. Each weapon feels good to shoot. Submachine gunfire lights up the immediate vicinity as you annihilate clawed aliens; a sniper rifle's scope wavers in just the right way as you zoom in, and it's a sadistic pleasure to watch your victim collapse into a heap when you land a headshot. PSI powers also deliver thrills. You might perform bloody murder with a simple wave of your hand, and bringing down one of those persistent gunships in this manner is a particular treat. But the way you play might not be the way others play. You could snipe, but maybe you'd rather deflect bullets with your sword until you can move in for a closer kill. You might sneak past turrets, where someone else might hack them, using the game's convoluted hacking mechanics. But if you go that route, be careful: your target might instead hack you, filling your field of vision with a grimacing face for a time, or even sending you back to the dream world where that glowing door awaits to teleport you back to your adventure.        The great flexibility continues to the mission objectives. The odd dialogue may not always indicate the consequences of your choices, or even that there is a choice involved in the first place. But how you respond when interacting with other characters can open up new avenues (directions to a secret tunnel, perhaps) or turn previously friendly characters against you. Some characters offer side missions, while others might be open to bribery if you've got the cash. And the main story, focusing as it does on divided loyalties, asks you to make some game-altering decisions along the way. Unclear or nonexistent waypoints can frustrate you during a few of these missions. But it's empowering to know that there are numerous ways of tackling objectives, giving you good reason to replay missions, tackle the campaign with the same character again, or even create a new avatar and start from scratch.      Where E.Y.E. falters is in the particulars. Weapon hotkeys don't function, so you're forced to use the mousewheel to switch weapons, which can mean the difference between life and death. Death isn't a huge deal: you get a certain number of resurrections before you have to restart the level, and you don't lose any items or level progress. But you are resurrected not at a spawn point, but right where you fell--perhaps in the middle of a horde of monsters. When you play E.Y.E. cooperatively and can be resurrected by your buddies, this is sensible. On your own, it's ridiculous--especially during the out-of-place sequences in which you fend off hordes of mutinous mutants. Meanwhile, the friendly AI goes out of its way to irritate. Your summoned companions stubbornly refuse to get out of the way, boxing you in when you most need freedom of movement, causing you to shoot them yourself just to rid yourself of the annoyance. Comrades carelessly march up and down the hallways of the temple, perfectly willing to push you into the abyss underneath.         Even the simple act of interfacing with E.Y.E. is a headache. Beyond the initial growing pains, just pulling off a skill can be clumsy. You can customize various powers to the radial interface, though that interface often clears itself whenever you quit the game, meaning you might have to reassign shortcuts every time you play. (At least you can customize some keyboard shortcuts to get around this issue.) To purchase new weapons, items, skills, and such, you have to stroll about the overlarge temple, wishing that such a simple task didn't involve wasting so much time. In the final level, when you have to make an absurdly awkward jump to continue the mission, it's hard not to wonder why it's there. E.Y.E. invites you to ask ""why"" quite often. ""Why do I have to manually reload when my clip runs dry?"" ""Why can't I shoot enemies if they stand directly in front of me?"" The game's lack of spoon-feeding can be refreshing. But sometimes developer Streum On Studio's blatant attempts to be different backfire. It's one thing to be ambitious and intricate; it's another to lack common sense.      The frustrations are clear. And yet, E.Y.E. has that ""it"" factor, a product of its dingy ambience, its big levels, and its insistence on letting you do it your own way, come hell or high water. Its ambition extends beyond these qualities, however, and into its multiplayer support. Your progress is persistent, so the levels you achieve and the skills you earn are carried over into online matches. The game supports up to 32 players in a cooperative game, and you can play stand-alone missions this way, or the entire campaign. Large co-op missions are interesting, but they don't feel truly cooperative as much as a shared map in which everyone is doing their own thing. They do, however, fit nicely with the ambience. In certain levels, you hear distant gunfire and witness factions trading fire with each other, even when playing on your own. Seeing these conflicts take place involving real players adds to the excitement. The most fascinating and more challenging way to play is with a few others, however, planning out your strategies and using your powers creatively. Use cloaking to flank monsters. Protect your hacker from alien attack. Spread out and search for all those hidden teleportation devices. Have a sniper leap to high ground and take down soldiers from afar, while a stealthy assassin jams a syringe into their unsuspecting backsides. Missions that aggravate you when you're on your own, such as the final showdown, are hugely entertaining when you have buddies at your side playing with completely different toys.         The draw of many intimidating and intricate games is similar: when you put a lot into them, you can get a lot in return. This equation doesn't always compute in E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy's favor. Even when you overcome the steep learning curve, various elements might leave you cold, whether that be the bullheaded AI, the resetting radial menu, or a number of other peculiarities. But maybe you're tired of games that set the bar low. Maybe you're tired of shooting galleries, turret sequences, and having too little freedom to do as you wish. E.Y.E. doesn't always deliver--it shoots for the stars and only reaches the moon. But that's still a lot further than you might have expected for a downloadable budget game like this.     "
4450,0 Day Attack on Earth,4.0,0,"  Screwing up a simple top-down shooter is quite the accomplishment, but Japanese developer Gulti has done a fine job of it with 0 Day Attack on Earth. This Xbox Live Arcade exclusive is a repetitive grind, stocked with annoying enemies and afflicted by dumb allied AI that makes the handful of levels featured here amazingly frustrating, as well as gamepad-smashingly difficult. Don't be lured in by the inclusion of a few potentially nifty co-op and multiplayer options--there are way too many serious problems here for the game to be worth anything close to its 1,200-point asking price.        Gameplay is a straightforward shot of dual-stick shooter action. Big nasty aliens have invaded the Earth, and our only hope is a guy in a little plane with three wingmen buddies. As usual with these sorts of games, you move with the left stick and shoot with the right. You also have access to three smart bombs per plane that blow up everything around you. Levels are set in the unfriendly skies above the ravaged metropolises of New York, Tokyo, and Paris. One of the game's claims to fame is accurately depicting each city, although there are so many aliens whipping around along with huge noxious clouds of some extraterrestrial chemical warfare project that it's impossible to take note of any buildings in the skylines save for iconic landmarks like the Tokyo Tower. The lone goal in each city level is to take down a specific number of massive boss aliens before a timer ticks down to zero. Other ETs also flit around getting in the way, however, and you typically have to spend a few moments in each level blasting them in order to earn power-ups needed to jazz up the weaponry on your aircraft (double shots, a spread of blaster bolts, that sort of thing). Without some extra oomph behind your gunplay, it can be nearly impossible to take out the bosses. But if you spend too much time on the small fries, you risk running out the clock.     Sound simple? It is, but virtually nothing in 0 Day Attack on Earth has been implemented correctly. For starters, the allied AI of your wingmen is atrocious. They just fly around almost randomly, following you to the targets that you attack but then shooting in all directions and offering no help at all when taking down the alien boss ships. If this is the best that Earth can muster, we're screwed. After the first New York level, things get very difficult because of this absence of assistance. Tokyo bosses are insanely tough to take down flying solo, with defensive barriers that regenerate after a few moments and tons of help from their alien buddies. To get the most out of the game, you need to fill the wingman slots with other human fliers in multiplayer modes, such as co-op and Capture the Flag. This is harder than it sounds, though, because nobody seems to be playing online right now. Hours of trying to scare up a match resulted in just a couple of co-op games that lagged and teammates quickly abandoned.        Even if you can cajole some poor friend into playing 0 Day Attack on Earth with you, there isn't much here to keep anyone interested aside from creepy-looking alien ships and eerie music that can be downright chilling, especially during the assault on Tokyo. Levels are all virtually identical in how they play. While there is a varied lineup of helper goons that include massive tripods, triangular UFOs, and weird orange balls that swallow you up then go boom unless your buddies intervene with a few well-placed shots (good luck with that if you're playing with computer-controlled wingmen), the bosses are all lame motherships that just sit there while you blast away. Sure, these massive monstrosities have defenses like mile-long metal tentacles and rotating flame cannons. But the most reliable tactic is always to just set up shop on its doorstep then blast away with your main guns and smart bombs. Just one type of mothership is featured on each level, too. So you soon fall into a rut, using the exact same tactics to take down one vessel after another. The pace is very slow because you don't need to move all that much aside from circle-strafing. Action bogs down and gets very dreary in short order because after you've played one level, you've pretty much played them all.     There are many, many better dual-stick shooters out there for the Xbox 360 than 0 Day Attack on Earth. Spend your points on them and give this poorly executed extraterrestrial invasion a pass.  "
2450,Retrovirus,7.0,2,"Descent in the mid-'90s.        Storytelling isn't Retrovirus' strong suit. Played solo or cooperatively, the campaign throws you right into the action amid a deluge of tech-speak, offering a confusing introduction to the world and its metal inhabitants. Taking place within the confines of a desktop computer, the game opens with a boot sequence that reveals a bustling society of microscopic robots going about their routines. That is, until a nasty wormlike virus infiltrates the system and unleashes hell. You play as a heavily armed antivirus bot dispatched on a seek-and-destroy mission--one that leads you down a winding path through the system's inner workings and requires you to annihilate tons of volatile purple gunk.      You sporadically uncover emails throughout your trek that fill in a few blanks on the bigger conspiracy that's afoot, but the dry dialogue and hollow exchanges between the game's disembodied cast of robotic characters don't bring much personality to this harsh electronic landscape. Simply put, the narrative hook is lacking. Even by the end, it's hard to feel any lasting connection to the shaky plot or its characters, but the journey itself is a wild ride nonetheless.     As you move from one area of the computer's system to the next, exploration and combat are inextricably linked by the need to clear away the nasty trails of purple corruption left behind by the virus. Playing clean-up duty is both challenging and fulfilling, since the large pustules join with snaking tendrils to form a foul network that houses spawn pits for a bevy of alienlike foes. From bulbous beasts that spew heat-seeking charges to flitting critters that multiply when killed, the vile menagerie is formidable in large numbers. Taking down their infrastructure quickly is crucial, and the attacking creatures aren't pushovers. Among their many traits, they can all infest and re-infest friendly droids to turn them against you. Their tenacity proves equally thrilling and harrowing at times, so emerging victorious to purge each area of its pestilence delivers a level of satisfaction that's on par with scratching a stubborn itch--over and over again.        Thankfully, your antivirus drone is largely up to the hefty task. It's extremely maneuverable, letting you move in six directions and rotate your angle a full 360 degrees. While this ""six degrees of freedom"" makes moving and fighting through twisty corridors and larger obstacle-filled rooms disorienting at first when enemies are coming at you from all directions, it's an exciting way to play that hasn't been done this well in a while. Along with the ability to cloak for a short time, boost to escape danger, and send out a scan ray to detect nearby foes, your scrappy little bot has a versatile assortment of perks to draw from. As you level up, you can cherry-pick helpful plug-ins from three loadout categories that boost your abilities, enhance your arsenal, and assist in other ways. What's great is that you're never locked into your decisions either. You can reshuffle your plug-in points to adapt to different combat situations, which is necessary for surviving everything Retrovirus throws at you.     A limited-yet-rechargeable power supply that ties in to your weapons and abilities keeps the balance of power in check. If you fire too frequently or use other abilities in tandem with your guns haphazardly, you rapidly deplete your reserves and have to wait until they recharge. This adds tension to most combat situations, since you often run out of juice while battling in close quarters. This balance is necessary early on; however, it works against you in the game's larger, tougher confrontations that throw massive swarms of foes at you. Frequent checkpoints and quick saves help counter most of this frustration, though some stretches are particularly brutal. The fact that these killer areas are sometimes sandwiched between quieter zones offers some relief, but they tend to blindside you as a result.     The organic nature of your foes provides great visual contrast to the tech-heavy environments you explore and battle through. Retrovirus' impressive visual design and frequently changing environments help carry some of the more repetitious combat sequences that pop up. Sporadic boss battles, light puzzle sections, and some optional objectives to boost your experience further flesh things out too. Beyond the main campaign, several multiplayer options are worth exploring despite an anemic online player base. Group co-op is functional but hampered by various glitches, such as doors not opening for all players. Deathmatches against bots or other players are fast-paced and use a cool weapon upgrade system that triggers new perks as you amass kills.        The MOBA mode is by far the most interesting option, however. It pits opposing teams against one another to push through their opponents' base defenses and destroy their nexus. Mobs, turrets, and other players add to the chaos, as you battle alongside human comrades and drones alike. The push-pull flow of these battles makes for some hotly contested matches. They're a lot of fun when you have enough human players to fight against and alongside. It's just a shame there aren't many players online with whom to take advantage of these multiplayer features.     As a revival of classic Descent-style exploration and combat, Retrovirus masterfully revamps and improves on the winning formula that hooked players almost two decades ago. A weak story and other fumbles make it hard to fully embrace the experience, but this unique, fast-paced shooter is still worth digging into for its distinct setting and intense virus slaying. Overlook a few foibles, and you'll find blasting bugs a sporadically blissful time.  "
1038,Gundam Versus,7.0,2,"Gundam Versus plays more like a beat-em-up than a traditional fighting game, and depending on which game mode you choose, you’ll play as either a lone wolf or in a group with one or two CPU players--real players if you take it online--and team up to take down the enemy. In the single-player modes you’ll face pre-defined waves of enemies or a team of Gundam. Just beware: most dialogue is left untranslated. It won't prevent you from knowing what to do, but you can't easily follow what most characters have to say, save for your navigator.Competitive multiplayer is more raw, focusing solely on Gundam-versus-Gundam bouts, which feel more dynamic and dramatic than merely facing off against AI. PvP is not just the most exciting way to play, but also the most gratifying. This is assuming you have a strong connection, as any server issues, which feel particularly prevalent in 3v3 modes, hurt the frame rate and render matches nigh unplayable.How you go about dispatching the enemy is largely dependent on the mech you choose to pilot. Not that selecting a particular style of Mobile Suit aligns you to one playstyle; thankfully you are free to attack opponents how you see fit. You can lay down cannon fire from long-range then close in for a quick melee combo, or take advantage of your Suit’s maneuverability, waiting for the right moment to counter-attack. But whether you’re effective on the battlefield comes down to how well you learn each mech’s particular behaviors.Despite the Gundams' impressive power, they are relatively simple to control. You can fly straight up into the air and change direction on a dime using power boosters; you just have to govern them appropriately to avoid overheating. Melee and ranged attacks typically require one button to activate, though you can often combine them for slightly more advanced attacks. However there are some subtle and not-so-subtle variations of this, which means there’s a heap of variety, but it can also feel inscrutable at times. Sometimes pulling back on the left stick and hitting your melee attack throws a block, using the Gundam’s giant shield for protection. But for others, this same move can unleash a devastating attack instead of providing the protection you’re seeking.Hitting with ranged attacks is more about precise timing--and perhaps a bit of luck. There’s no free aim; everything offensive is governed by a locking system that cycles through enemies by tapping a button. Without a way to lead your target to make sure your shots are landing, often you can get a little lost when trying to cycle through to latch on to the one you want to take down. It could be a little smarter too, as it doesn’t take distance to the target into account when cycling. That split second can be the difference between nailing a sweet combo, or being on the receiving end of deadly flurry of blows that ends the round in a fireball. More annoying--and borderline unfair--is that enemies don’t take any damage from attacks while they’re staggered, but they can seemingly knock you about while you’re in the same position. Feeling like you’re at such a disadvantage under attack can lead to some incredibly frustrating defeats.Having your mech shot down is something you get used to pretty fast, but it doesn’t mean the end of the battle. Respawns aren’t governed by a number of lives, but rather a Battlefield-style ticket-based system, where the number assigned to your Mobile Suit (as seen on the character select screen) represents the number of tickets respawning in that Mobile Suit will cost. Given the number of tickets you’re allotted changes on a per-battle basis, weighing up that cost versus the level of firepower they provide should factor into your choice. It’s all good and well to default to some of the more powerful suits, but they can be slower and more unwieldy, leaving you open to attack more often than you might be prepared for.The arenas within which you unleash robot hell give the appearance of being much larger than they really are; the playable area in each is pared down to only a small portion of the map. While this is somewhat disappointing, each of the environments has its own aesthetic style, from a space colony split in half by an asteroid that’s still embedded in its side, to the more familiar surroundings of a large earth city or an open forest or mountain range.Some of the less spectacular ground and surrounding building textures are highlighted by nice lighting, but the overall scope and size of each arena does enough to make up for the missing detail. And many of the buildings and objects within each arena are destructible, crumbling to chunky pieces as you and your opponents launch all manner of missiles, lasers and big robot fists at each other. It’s a nice touch but also gives the impression of kicking over a tower of foam blocks, lacking the kind of visual quality and wow factor that would bring it up to par with many of the mechs' attacks--some of which, by the way, look devastatingly powerful, with huge flashes of lasers, lights and explosions dominating the screen when they hit their target.Gundam Versus is dedicated to the Gundam universe, and the treatment of the source material is easy to appreciate, even for someone unfamiliar with the series. That said, some loose mechanics, the paltry localization, and multiplayer's inability to deal with less-than-perfect network connections aren't easy to ignore. A smarter locking system, better demonstration of the differences between various Mobile Suits and the ability to attack downed enemies like they can to you would make for an improved experience, on the battlefield at least. But Gundam Versus nonetheless offers some light-hearted, robot smashing fun."
3932,SimCity 2000,5.0,1," City-building games typically have a fair number of menus, and you usually need a large amount of screen real estate to manage all of the land, properties, and resources at your disposal. On a personal computer, this isn't a problem. Today's large displays--800x600 pixels or higher--provide ample room for overseeing your progress, and between the mouse and keyboard, all of the data you need is just one or two clicks away. The Game Boy Advance doesn't have a large screen, however, and its input options are limited to just six buttons. For any game that's specifically designed for the GBA, these shortcomings don't pose much of a setback, but for SimCity 2000, which was originally developed with the PC in mind, these limitations hamstring the game so much that it's impossible to enjoy it.      Full Fat, the game's developer, does deserve credit for keeping the GBA version faithful to its PC counterpart. You start out with some land and $10,000, which you need to use to buy a power plant, lay down roads, put up power lines, and designate portions of the land into residential, industrial, or commercial zones. Once the infrastructure is in place, people gradually begin to settle in your city and populate it with their homes and businesses.    Your goal is to keep the city growing and the population happy. That means responding to people's demands by building schools, police stations, fire stations, museums, parks, and any of a dozen other structures as the need arises, and expanding the city when it fills its current bounds. The key to SimCity is recognizing and handling problems quickly. If a portion of the city runs low on power, you need to build an additional power plant. If an earthquake occurs or aliens invade--just two of the many disasters that can happen--you need to send out firefighters and bulldozers to contain and clean up the problem. As time goes by, you'll gain access to new technologies, such as trains, buses, airports, and fusion power plants.    All in all, it's pretty easy to dive right in and get a city going. You can play year by year in the main mode or try the scenario mode, which challenges you to survive a natural disaster and recover a certain amount of the population within a limited number of years. One of the nicest aspects of SimCity 2000 is that the city comes alive as you play. Houses become high-rise apartment buildings, small shops transform into skyscrapers, warehouses turn into factories, and new construction sites pop up every time you zone a new portion of land. It's details like these that make you feel as though you're in charge of a vibrant, growing metropolis.   A few compromises were made to get the game running comfortably on the GBA, but they'll probably only perturb those people who were hoping to take an exact duplicate of the PC version with them on the road. Most of these changes are graphical cutbacks meant to lighten the load on the handheld's CPU. For instance, in the Mac, PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions of SimCity 2000, you can observe cars, buses, and trains moving along on the streets and rails of your city. The streets in the GBA game are completely bare and don't display vehicles of any kind. Underground features, such as sewers and subways, are also absent from the GBA game.    For various reasons, sadly, SimCity 2000 is a real pain to play on the GBA. The isometric viewpoint allows large buildings to obscure smaller problems, such as broken roads and house fires, and the cramped screen resolution makes it tough to keep track of all but a small portion of the city. The default view only displays a swath of land roughly 10 by 10 acres in size, but most cities are 20 times that size. You can zoom out the camera viewpoint in order to see the entire city, but the graphics become so tiny in the process that discernable details just disappear.      The menu structure is extremely cumbersome as well, mainly due to the limited number of buttons you have to work with on the system. In the PC version, every menu had its own button. Here on the GBA, each menu you bring up has multiple options and lists to wade through. Push the B button and you can view information about the property you have highlighted. Tap L and you'll bring up the construction menu, which lists all of the various structures and objects that you can build. Tap R and you'll bring up map options that allow you to zoom and rotate your city. The select button brings up a list of maps that let you check out various aspects of your city--zoning, roads, power grid, police coverage, and fire coverage. If you want to slow down or speed up the passage of time, enable automatic budgeting, or disable natural disasters, you can access these options from the start button menu. If you're laying down an object, such as a power line or police station, you have to push the A button again to confirm its placement. SimCity 2000 is a game full of tiny tasks, and all of these menus just get in the way of performing what ought to be simple one-step choices.   The graphical compromises that were made to put SimCity 2000 onto the GBA don't hurt the game all that much. There's still plenty of micromanagement, and you can waste hours just building up your own personal metropolis. Unfortunately, the system's screen and button layout prove to be limitations that the game can't overcome. "
2580,Awesomenauts,8.0,2,"     You play as one of six Awesomenauts on a mission to mine solar, a galactic fuel source and currency. Unfortunately, another group of Awesomenauts wants the solar too, and so you must fight to control the precious resource. The premise and plot are as absurd as a monkey with a jetpack, but Awesomenauts isn't about telling a story; it's about battle. You pick your hero, join two others (or AI-controlled bots), and slug it out against another team of three on one of a few symmetrical maps. Your goal isn't to kill other players, but to reach and destroy their solar core. While killing opposing heroes helps, this is not a game of 2D team deathmatch, and playing it as a straight team deathmatch game is a recipe for frustration. Success in Awesomenauts requires teamwork, strategy, and smart upgrade decisions.            Unfortunately, not all of the characters are available up front, which means you need to level up your account through matches with characters you might not like in the meantime. You can level up in offline practice modes (the only single-player option because there is no campaign mode), but playing against the not-so-smart AI doesn't come close to playing against real people with real strategies. Awesomenauts isn't as intimidating as its PC counterparts, but it's still a MOBA game, which means you need to invest in some tinker time to find the right build. There's a short tutorial in the beginning of the game, but it focuses more on the basic mechanics than it does on how to build a character and a team. It would have been nice to see some character-specific scenarios that offered tips on upgrade selections.         You have several abilities, each mapped to the face buttons, and you move around the 2D space with the left analog stick. A knowledgeable, synchronized team of Awesomenauts is a thing of beauty. There's a camaraderie that blossoms when you successfully use your character's strengths to cover a teammate's weaknesses. You're never an all-star in Awesomenauts, because lone wolves die fast; rather, you're always a team player, doing your part for the success of the group. The focus on an objective and the reliance on others make Awesomenauts feel more like a team sport than a typical frag fest. Once you get on a roll with a team, it's hard to stop. Every match is a new challenge: Will the next team have a better strategy than yours? Does someone have a different build of Lonestar the space cowboy that could best yours? Should you try out that new upgrade you unlocked? The addictive momentum of Awesomenauts is easy to get caught up in.     The 2D presentation is the most obvious departure from the usual MOBA setup, but it's the art style and underlying absurdity that steal the show. Awesomenauts has everything you'd want out of a wacky Saturday-morning cartoon: ridiculous eccentric characters, goofy voice acting, and an enthusiastic theme song, complete with an over-the-top animated intro. The characters are brimming with personality. They're all visually unique and easily identifiable, which is great since things can get hectic on the 2D battlefield. You won't mistake the floating brain creature Voltar for the hip-hop-inspired Froggy G (who might have the best theme music of any hero). The dedication to the Saturday-morning cartoon theme makes it feel like Awesomenauts is based on an actual show, and after spending a few hours with the colorful cast, you might wish it were.         If you've never played a MOBA, Awesomenauts is a great place to start. Grab some friends, take the time to study up on your favorite characters, and you'll have a blast. MOBA pros may enjoy the fresh perspective and the quirky characters too. There are a couple of hiccups that can spoil the fun, but they're not frequent enough to ruin the experience. For just $10 or 800 Microsoft points, Awesomenauts is a great value offering a deep and rewarding competitive battleground.   "
3157,Asphalt 3D,6.0,1,"Asphalt: Urban GT hitting shelves alongside the DS in 2004. The Asphalt series hasn't changed much since then; it still aims to deliver accessible high-speed arcade racing thrills, and in Asphalt 3D, it often succeeds. Unfortunately, it also sometimes crashes and burns, placing too much emphasis on its shoddy impact physics and ugly collisions. But when it's not tripping itself up, Asphalt 3D is good fun, and the variety of its 17 tracks and the 42 licensed cars you can acquire make it pretty substantial, too.       Tron.     There's fun to be had in speeding and drifting around the tracks as you jockey for position with other racers and try to avoid oncoming traffic. The physics emphasize speed rather than realism; you might hit a barrier in the road while going extremely fast, only to find yourself shunted sideways and back on track after the impact with very little loss in momentum. Such moments are silly, but they keep the race moving. The occasional pop-in of large structures aside, the 17 tracks look good and offer plenty of variety, from the hairpin turns and sunny waterfront of Saint-Tropez to the speedy straightaways and starry, UFO-occupied night sky of Las Vegas. Outrageous shortcuts, such as one that sends you flying through the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, add some adrenaline to the races. (Finding these shortcuts isn't hard; they're clearly marked on the map that's constantly displayed on the lower screen.) The depth added by the 3D visuals contributes to the breakneck sense of speed as you tear down the streets, and heads-up display elements like your boost gauge, speed, and position hover impressively in the foreground. Your engine whines and your brakes screech convincingly, with the generic yet pulsating electronica selections on the soundtrack suiting the sleek presentation well.        Although it provides stretches of excitement, Asphalt 3D often trips itself up in its attempts to deliver still greater intensity. Not unlike the Burnout games, Asphalt 3D places special emphasis on crashes, and sadly, the crashes here are so terrible that the game would have benefitted from placing as little emphasis on them as possible. When you hit another vehicle at speed, you're shown the crash in slow motion. This often reveals the vehicles passing almost completely through each other or jumping around in space as if the game can't quite decide where they belong. Sometimes, the camera fails to get the impact front and center, so you hear the noises of impact but only see a small part of it on the edge of the screen. This focus on crashing also detracts from gameplay. At times, you may find yourself the subject of police attention, and in their reckless attempts to put a stop to you, the cops may frequently tap your vehicle from the rear and then wreck. These wrecks not only interrupt the race by trying to show you the crash, but they also make police pursuit more of a nagging nuisance than a source of tension. The presence of these other cars crowding around you also often triggers severe frame rate drops.     Competition types that put a focus on something other than being the fastest around the track are weak. In high-speed chase events, you're constantly pursued by a bunch of cops and have to get across the finish line without getting busted a certain number of times. Their ineffectual efforts to stop you mean that this is not hard, or fun, to do. Vigilante events require you to wreck a certain number of street racers, again putting undue focus on the game's weakest aspect. Still other competition types are essentially broken. As their name suggests, drift events require you to do a certain amount of drifting before you cross the finish line. These are set up like races, with AI competitors circling the track with you. But it makes no difference if you cross the finish line first or last; all that matters is that you acquire the necessary number of drift points. If you approach the end of your final lap and haven't yet earned those points, you can simply pull a U-turn, drive the wrong way for a while, and then turn around again to do more drifting as you head for the finish line. Cash challenges also suffer from the same issue. You need to rack up a certain amount of money to win, but you can pull U-turns and earn more cash if you find yourself short as you approach the finish line. You can take as much time as you need, so there's no challenge whatsoever, which makes completing these events an occasional tedious necessity as you advance through your career.     As you win competitions in the Career mode, you earn experience and level up, gaining access to more cars. There are 42 licensed vehicles on offer, including Audis, BMWs, and Ferraris, as well as a few less-conventional vehicles, like the three-wheeled Can-Am Spyder. Frequently being able to add better, faster cars to your collection is a satisfying reward for your progress. Leveling up also provides more tuning options, but don't expect to encounter any complexity in the garage. Everything you can purchase benefits the selected car in areas like acceleration, top speed, and nitro capacity, with no negative effects, and once purchased, these enhancements cannot be removed. Additionally, although each tuning option is available for each car, they are only purchased for the car you have selected at the time. So each time you get a new car, you need to take a minute to go through the process of purchasing all the available upgrades for that car if you want to optimize its performance. You earn so much money from races that there's never any reason not to purchase these upgrades, and their simplicity and the repetition of purchasing them for each car makes the whole process of dealing with them feel like busywork.        Multiplayer is local only and supports races for up to six players. The option works well, but competitors can only select cars that they have unlocked, so players need to be sure to pick cars with similar capabilities or the race will be wildly unbalanced. The game also has support for the 3DS's StreetPass, letting you compare your best times with those of people you come in contact with, as well as awarding you experience. Outside of the Career mode, you can also jump into one-off races against AI drivers, compete in vigilante and high-speed chase events, and race against ghost cars you've acquired from other players.     Ultimately, Asphalt 3D is an unremarkable but serviceable racer that too often doesn't put its best foot forward. It's a shame it didn't capitalize on its stronger aspects to deliver a more consistently thrilling experience, but even with its flaws, there's some speedy fun to be had on these streets.   "
1252,RIGS: Mechanized Combat League,6.0,1,"Virtual reality has the potential to make some game types better: storytelling can be more immersive, the jump scares of horror can be more frightening. However, fast-paced first-person games in VR have generally only succeeded at making me feel nauseated. But the PlayStation VR-exclusive RIGS Mechanized Combat League proves even that genre can work in the confines of a headset. RIGS has serious flaws in execution, but it nails the fundamentals of movement in VR in a way no other game I've experienced has.At its core, RIGS is a first-person shooter where you pilot a robotic mech through sprawling, multi-tiered arenas across three primary modes: Team Takedown (team deathmatch), Endzone (a capture-the-flag-meets-American-football variant), and Power Slam (the game's unique and most interesting mode). In Power Slam, you destroy opponents or collect orbs scattered around each arena to enter a powered-up Overdrive mode, after which you can jump through a large ring in the center of the map to score points for your team. The concept sounds complicated and weird, though the deathmatch-meets-basketball mashup is genuinely fun.But the number of camera and comfort options are what truly make racing across the game's maps and leaping through the air to score aerial takedowns feel so natural. When you turn and look around, the field of view around you, but without diminishing your peripheral view too drastically. When you get ejected from your rig, you can enjoy the flight up in the air where you'll choose your next respawn point, or just let the game momentarily black out the background while you soar upwards. And the ability to use your head to move around and aim, while disconcerting at first, is what makes the entire VR experience come together. You can always opt for a more traditional twin-stick controller setup, but the responsiveness of the game's head-tracking allows for almost mouse and keyboard-like precision (and the fairly generous aim-assist helps too).There's both a single-player and multiplayer campaign, and both are built around completing a set number of matches to complete a ""season."" The overall rank you earn--designated by the number of new fans you acquire after each match--carries across both online and off. And through increasing your rank, you can hire stronger AI teammates (though they also demand more of the reward pot for each match). But the matches too frequently felt lopsided. I faced computer opponents who sometimes offered an exciting challenge, while others either completely crushed my team or fell to double-digit losses. But the pace of the matches are perfect--an endless, unpausing march of the game's clock that gets you in and out of the action in 10 minutes.When you can find a match, the game really shines mode. It's more fun to play against human opponents than the game's inconsistent AI, you can actively coordinate with your real-life teammates, and, you can swap out your RIG in-between matches (in the offline mode, you have to back out to the game's garage to change your RIG). And, outside of sometimes seeing a delay between the start of a match and my teammates appearing, there's no noticeable lag or similar technical issues when playing online. However, actually getting into a match can be an insurmountable chore; I haven't been able to start a full 3v3 match on any mode except Team Takedown since the game's launch. The wait might not be so bad if there was something to do while you waited, but there's nothing to do on the loading screen except look around the main menu hub--and that oppressive wait is compounded by the fact that you're isolated inside a VR headset. It's funny that the part of RIGS that forces you to take a break with the headset off isn't the intensity of combat, it’s the boringness of the loading screen.RIGSs combat is about quick matches and intense shootouts, but lots of little additions continually drag down that sense of speed. Each match starts with the same laborious screen where you and your teammates get loaded into your mech, and every single time after you finish a match, you're forced to watch a completely pointless dance animation from the MVP of the match. Every. Single. Time. Regardless of whether it's you, a teammate, or the opposition, you can't skip it, and it just gets more and more irksome when you're itching to jump into another match.And RIGS shows that same lack of urgency in the way you unlock the game's mechs. RIGS seems to keep things simple by giving you four core models to choose from: the small and agile Hunter, the airborne Tempest, the tank-like Sentinel, and the balanced Mirage. But then for each mech type, there is another subset of classes, each with a separate perk--like leaving leaving a martyr-like bomb behind when your RIG explodes or regaining health for taking down enemies. Then on top of the perks, the weapon loadout for each mech is different and locked to that specific mech.Outside of the first mech you earn, you have to purchase each additional one with in-game funds. You earn funds pretty quickly both online and off--every few matches you earn enough to buy another mech--but it's a tedious system that makes nailing down which mech combination is right for you unnecessarily complicated. And it also makes figuring out exactly how weapons work more of a chore, since there is such a wide assortment of different armaments; after purchasing a new mech, you have to go into a separate training room to test it out. As a game that focuses on online competition, it just doesn't make sense all of the various mech types, abilities, and weapons aren't available from the beginning.The game's upgrades are equally ill-conceived. From the home menu, you can select ""sponsorships"" that task you with things like ""complete five melee takedowns"" or ""earn MVP twice"" and reward you with cosmetic upgrades like visors, uniforms, and helmets. But the rewards are only for your pilot, not your mech. And you can only choose two sponsorships at a time, one for your online campaign and one for offline; after completing a sponsorship, if you want to swap it out (and thus get a new reward), you have to back out to the main hub and cycle through another menu. You still earn lesser rewards for meeting the stipulations of the sponsorship a second time, but you only earn the bigger cosmetic one once. On top of that, you don't get a preview of the cosmetic rewards you can earn--basically, you don't know what you're working towards (beyond ""new visor"" or ""new suit"") until you earn it.The groundwork is here for an amazing first-person experience in VR. RIGS controls are top-notch, and aside from the grating, repetitive announcers, the arenas are colorful places that I love competing in. But the smaller details that RIGS stumbles over make it hard to justify continuing after completing an initial season. RIGS is a great showcase for how to make a VR shooter, but it's also a game that could learn from the ""less is more"" mantra."
4818,Stephen King's F13,3.0,0,"The only thing scary about this paper-thin collection of screen savers, desktop wallpaper, and minigames is the price: $29.95. Even with the Stephen King novella Everything's Eventual packed in, F13 is an overpriced and unimaginative squandering of the King license. Two out of the three features in F13 that can actually pass for games are whack-a-mole variants. In Bug Splat you squash ascending rounds of cockroaches with a fly swatter, a rolled newspaper, and finally a hammer. Likewise, in Whack-a-Zombie you suppress an uprising of the undead from a screen of gravesites. And that's it - no network play for goofing off at the office, no interesting twists on the formula. No Swimming is a tad more enticing, for about two minutes: It's a fun turn on the old fish-tank screensaver in which you use a decapitated hand to feed a tank of piranha with live rhinos, dogs, cows, and horses. Ignore your adorable pets and they start smashing the screen. The ghoulish premise, detailed graphics, and good animal sounds (rhinos don't like being picked up) make No Swimming the only piece in the package that actually approaches Stephen King's own dark humor. F13's collection of 20 sound files and ten wallpaper images are both stingy and remarkably bland. A screen of eyeballs, King logos, assorted screams, etc. seem to have strained the limits of the design team's imagination, and few of the images are even remotely clever or creepy. It seems the designers made little attempt to think through how the sounds and wallpaper might actually replace standard desktop effects. Background images of roaches and a hearse as well as noises such as screams and axe chops are nice enough, but how much creative energy does it really take to assemble witty, horrific effects that beg to be used for the most common computer operation? Moreover, why not take some of these creepy themes and convert them into standard desktop fare, like a calculator that screams or a daybook with eerie alarms? F13's seven screen savers are more like mini-movies, all of which have good graphic design but underwhelming premises. In Murder and Mayhem, we see the silhouettes of a killer and his unsuspecting female victim through different windows in an old house. In It's Just Lightning, we see a demonic clown illuminated by lightning flashes creeping up on a homeowner as he tries to replace a fuse. While the screen savers are fairly clever, you need to sit through the five-minute cycle of each to get all the sight gags, which obviously begs for some sort of startling denouement. To be fair, just about all desktop gadgets, wallpapers, and screen savers grow stale quickly. But more considerate designers make up for this by providing a wide variety of add-ons and variations that users can swap in and out frequently. Not so with F13, which can't even muster up more than a dozen wallpapers. The King story, Everything's Eventual, is pretty standard fare that's reminiscent of The X-Files. A dullard of a young man signs up with a secret corporation, Trans, to wreak a kind of cosmic justice on the world's bad guys. The novella is presented in an onscreen book. It's entertaining to read, but just as underpowered as everything else in F13, thanks to its sparse sound accompaniment and uninteresting illustrations. You can't print the story out, and the multimedia add-ons are so weak that you'll wonder why. Even rabid King fans and completists will be disappointed with F13. It's unclear whether the designers even read much of the author's work, as so little of it informs these gadgets aside from a trivia screen saver. Given King's library of familiar plots and icons like Salem's Lot, Carrie, Cujo, and Christine, it's surprising that Presto Studios missed the opportunity. Just imagine the ways in which a vindictive Carrie, rabid Cujo, or pissed off Firestarter could have torn apart your screen. How about blood-filled vampire meters for indicating system resources or battery life? In fact, every gadget in F13 will probably only leave you thinking about all the ways it could have been done better. The only one who might be frightened by F13 is Stephen King himself, who risks tainting a fine pop entertainment legacy by attaching his name to this sort of thing."
1389,Black Desert Online,7.0,2,"With these and so many other messes crying out for a cleanup crew, how is it that Black Desert Online is so absorbing?Its success is in how it positions itself as a virtual life, rather than as a theme park. There are no instanced dungeons or raids. You can focus on quests and combat if you prefer, but it's when you explore and exploit Black Desert Online's trading and crafting systems that the game begins to click. When you let your entrepreneurial spirit grow, you are no longer the quest-givers' pawn, but a real citizen taking root in a digital home. You are a fisher, a horse breeder, and a farmer. You are a lumberer, a salesperson, and an economist. Similar games check off some of the same boxes--ArcheAge and EVE Online come to mind, among others. But Black Desert Online is just novel enough to capture your imagination, and you may adore it in spite of the game's own efforts to push you away.As I write this, I am fishing. Well, my sorceress is, at least. You can actively fish, which involves casting your line (perhaps after applying a bit of bait) and performing a quick-time minigame when something bites. But sometimes, I leave my avatar at the shore and let her catch as much as she can until my fishing pole runs out of stamina and I have to replace it. Automated fishing takes longer than the alternative, but I can still feel as though I am accomplishing something, even if I want to take a stretch or make a sandwich. As for the fish I catch, what I do with them depends on my mood. I might dry them (drying is one of multiple ways you can process the items you gather) and sell them as is on the player marketplace; or perhaps I will stew up some fishy food by heading to my house and cooking some victuals at the stove. The result? A nice movement-speed boost for me, or for whomever I sell the concoction to.The life-sim activities are hardly limited to fishing. I plant seeds in multiple gardens, water them and fertilize them if I want, and harvest the results. Sometimes, I use my hired workers to create bundles of wheat and pumpkins that I sell to traders, while other times I process the ingredients into something more nourishing. The wheat, for instance, can be ground up, then added to mineral water and shaken to create dough. The dough is useful for making meat pie for me and my customers, and exotic wine for my NPC workers, who must be raging alcoholics judging by how much booze they require to stay in top working condition.Where most online RPGs let you access the same stash from multiple hubs, warehouses in Black Desert Online are local; if your hired miner in Velia has gathered iron ore you need in Heidel City, the most cost-efficient way to move it is to transport the ore yourself with a wagon you buy or build. In addition, earning the most profit involves performing similar wagon runs. And so the trading-and-transport process begins. You check your wagon out of the stable, where it spawns into a jumble of other players' horses. Then you drive into another mess of player transports, since you must be close enough to the warehouse to transfer the goods. Finally, you awkwardly turn around and make your five-minute trip, cursing developer Pearl Abyss for forcing you to drive so close to the warehouse manager, who does business in a tight space unfriendly to wagons.That's Black Desert Online for you, though: throwing unnecessary obstacles into systems that are already complicated enough. My digital life feels a little less real and a little more tedious when I have to wade through a hodgepodge of horses with the word ""parking"" hovering above them, or when I lose all of my cooking ingredients because I added four mushrooms to my seafood salad recipe instead of three. I enjoy the slow pace of drying feathers in the wind, or driving my own pumpkin crates to sell in the next town over; it's the little frustrations that add up, many of them resulting from the sloppiest user interface in a genre known for sloppy interfaces.I wouldn't call Black Desert Online ""pay to win""--there's no competition to win, really--but its cash-grab tendencies are more blatant than in most such games.Figuring out these mechanics is no mean feat, not because Black Desert Online doesn't attempt to teach them to you, but because its haphazard questing doesn't naturally lead you from one step of the process to the next. It's easy to miss introductory quests entirely, and you may trip over them a dozen hours after you've already figured things out on your own. But now my business has boomed, and I'm reaping the delicious fruits of my labors. When starting out, I was dumbstruck by the awesome, outrageous prices for the very best armor and accessories. Ten million silver? If only I could possess such riches. Now, with an effective trading network and a workforce of drunk giants mining ore for me, I'm hoarding my own millions. Up next: breeding horses. There's a demand for them, you know, and you can tame wild horses if you're up for that sort of thing.Yes, this is a lot to take in, and I've excluded all sorts of other mechanics, some useful and interesting, and some not. Useful and interesting: investing in cities and farms in order to improve monster drop rates in particular regions. (You can never have enough equipment-enhancing stones.) Not useful or interesting: being limited by a currency called energy, which you spend with every tree you chop, every lizard you skin, and every rock you mine. When your guild begins a timed quest that sends every associate into the forest to chop wood, it's frustrating to cut down a few trees, only to realize you're out of energy and have to wait for it to replenish. Almost all crafting, processing, and gathering activities cost energy, as do engaging with NPCs in Black Desert Online's conversation minigames, and haggling with traders for better prices.Why does this limit exist? You might argue that it encourages you to go out and fight monsters for a while, or that it contributes to Black Desert Online's authenticity; after all, chopping wood in real life does use up an awful lot of energy. More likely, it exists to drive you to the real-money store, another atrocity of an interface that introduces more currencies (pearls, loyalty, and Daum Cash) that you can spend on various items, including energy tonics. I wouldn't call Black Desert Online ""pay to win""--there's no competition to win, really--but its cash-grab tendencies are more blatant than in most such games. For instance, in-game armor is drab and unvaried. If you're tired of seeing your wizard run around in a sea of similar-looking Gandalfs, your only recourse is to drop a wad of cash on a costume. By default, you don't experience the core RPG arc of seeing your character look more powerful over time; to look the part, you have to pay.These are more messes for the cleanup crew, then. But this is my new virtual life now, and I can forgive the transgressions because I am rewarded for my mastery. It is a world in which I can have it all or just a part of it; it is a world in which I can be this, that, or both at once. It's is also a gorgeous world, one of the best-looking in the genre, marred only by some distracting pop-in. But what's a little pop-in in a game this rich in detail? You can practically smell Glish Swamp's fetid fog as it spreads across the marsh, and can only imagine what gross toxins lurk in the algae-coated water. The tall green grasses and towering pines lining the Demi Riverbank make the countryside look lush and peaceful. Visually, Black Desert Online is the highest of high fantasy. Imagine a pastoral landscape, and the game's depiction will be even more pastoral than that. Picture a fanciful flamingo, and the game's depiction will be even more fanciful.Like other aspects of Black Desert Online, it takes some time to grow accustomed to the combat.Flamingos may be beautiful, but their feathers are valuable, so the best flamingo is a dead one. Birds aren't the most frightful enemy you face, however: orcs, cultists, and colossal demons are just a few of your foes, and Black Desert Online makes battling them a delight. Thank goodness, too, since you spend a good amount of time grinding for valuable drops and performing ""kill this, loot that"" quests.Combat is structured around the same kind of combos you might expect from an action game. You start with a few basic attacks, but as you level and earn skill points, you string punches, kicks, and magical incantations into dazzling displays of superhuman virtuosity. This isn't Bayonetta, so don't expect the same kind of depth or challenge. But it is consistently engaging and compelling to smack six orcs around at once while another party member spews lightning from her staff. Like other aspects of Black Desert Online, it takes some time to grow accustomed to the combat, but you soon become fluent in it. There's a logic and language to how individual keypresses combine into robust skills, and the resulting fluid animations are a fulfilling reward."
2979,El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron,8.0,2,"     Enoch the scrivener doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. Originally chosen to document the deeds of the elders, this courageous human is cast down to Earth to round up fallen angels before God washes away their sins (and the lives of countless humans) in a devastating flood. That's no small task for a man who's far more comfortable with a quill in his hand. This intriguing setup is based on apocryphal tales from ancient Judeo-Christian texts, and those unfamiliar with the source material may find it difficult to follow along. Characters are introduced and then forgotten without much fleshing out, so absorbing details can be tricky. Although you might not understand everything being laid before you, the manner of storytelling is intriguing. Plot details are conveyed in a number of unique ways, which goes a long way toward keeping you invested. Animated cutscenes alongside still shots sprinkled with expository text make up the bulk of the narrative. But the more interesting story elements are woven into the gameplay. There are times when you run through simple 2D canvases with dialogue filling in important pieces, and the integration of story within the action gives added weight to the experience.         Once challenged to a duel, you need to shift your focus from the atmospheric wonders to the demonic monsters closing in. Because your repertoire of moves is limited, combat is based more on positioning and timing than on trying to figure out which attack you should use. Every attack makes use of just one button. You perform different moves based on how you hit it (tap versus hold), if you use a modifier (which launches enemies in the air), or whether you're jumping or standing firmly on the ground. Block and jump buttons make up your defensive maneuvers, and you can dodge as well. It sounds simple, and it is easy to pick up, but there's more complexity than you might initially realize. Like all sentient beings, your enemies don't like being attacked. If you rush at them with rage in your eyes, they can just turtle, before countering with a flourish once you tire yourself out. But if you tap your attack in a slowed-down rhythm, you initiate a special move that knocks away their shields. Mastering this attack is a key to success. Combat feels like a violent dance in which you must keep perfect time if you want to excel. Tap too aggressively, and you might as well be swinging at a rock; tap too slowly, and you leave yourself vulnerable.        With each successful strike, you visibly damage your maniacal foes. El Shaddai is played without a HUD (you do unlock an option to use one once you finish the game), though the expertly designed visuals ensure you're aware of all the information you need. Both you and your enemies wear armor that gets destroyed as you take damage. When you land a particularly powerful attack, you can see the effects of your anger displayed on their ravaged bodies. It's an empowering feeling to knock your well-armored opponents silly until they're just running around in their skivvies. That almighty feeling goes both ways. Enoch loses his precious protection as fights wear on, too, and there's no better feeling than when you win a fight after digging in your heels when you're at your end. If you do fall in battle, you can revive yourself if your fingers are quick. Slamming on the shoulder or face buttons brings you back to life, though each successive attempt is harder than the last. Waking up at the last possible second and then tearing your stunned opponent to shreds is absolutely exhilarating.       Aside from your fists (which you do need to rely on during certain portions), there are three different weapons to play around with: arch, veil, and gale. The arch is the first weapon you're introduced to and the most versatile in your arsenal. It's a lightning-fast melee weapon that can deal a ton of damage in a hurry. The veil offers another way to let loose melee attacks. It is a combination of a shield and gauntlets, and though it's incredibly strong, it's also quite slow. Landing a few powerful hits shakes the screen (and your foe) in impressive fashion, though coming to grips with the timing can be tricky. The final piece of the punishment puzzle is the gale. This is much different from the other choices. Instead of rushing in close, you wing arrowlike objects at your enemies from afar. But when they get too close, you can use your dash to run them over like a steamroller.        Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses; just make sure you keep them clean. During the course of battle, your weapons slowly degrade from pure to corrupt. Once they turn to the dark side, they lose almost all of their impact, so you're just wasting your time flailing away. By tapping a button, you cleanse your tool, but be careful with your timing. You're vulnerable during those precious seconds, and this little twist adds another layer of depth to the combat. Although you're usually restricted to fighting two enemies at once (new ones jump in when their allies fall), it can be tough to keep your enemies at bay when it comes time to purify. At least you have another option. Once you sap away your opponents' health, they become stunned. That's your chance to steal their weapons. This is the only way you can switch weapons (you don't carry spares), so choose wisely. Taking enemies' weapons makes them significantly weaker, but you may be stuck with one you're not proficient with if you're not careful.        Although ordinary enemy encounters become predictable after a few hours, the boss battles continue to challenge and surprise until the very end. Major encounters are not always handled in a typical way. When you enter a new area (in search of one of the fallen angels), you often face your opponent rather quickly. These one-on-one affairs can be over in mere seconds because of the superior strength of your sparring partner. But even when you do fall, you continue playing, fleshing out the story through gameplay rather than noninteractive story sequences. Most boss fights don't let you continue on if you're not up to the task, however. Your opponents take a variety of shapes, and you have to do some strategizing to figure out how to exploit their weaknesses. In one battle, the boss morphs into different forms throughout the fight, and you have to use the correct weapon to deal damage. In another, you face two boarlike creatures at once, and your best chance at victory is tricking them into charging headfirst into each other. Each boss brings with it a new challenge to overcome, which paves the way for the most exciting action sequences in the game.        "
2355,GRID 2,8.0,2,"sensible, this opening race is a perfect example of what makes Grid 2 such a blast. This is a game that takes every opportunity to remove the barriers between you and the thrill of all-out street racing. With an exciting career mode and handling that strikes a great balance between arcade and simulation, it succeeds brilliantly at that task.        Whether you're drifting through the hills of rural Japan or careening along California's Pacific Coast Highway, Grid 2 gives you the tools to perform some truly spectacular automotive feats. This is all thanks to a driving model that borrows equally from the forgiving handling of an arcade racer and the demanding physics of a driving simulator. Cars are nimble and highly responsive, but there's a very real relationship between your tires and the surface beneath them. You can give up only so much traction before a drift sends you spinning into a barricade, while accelerating too quickly out of a corner can spell disaster if you've forgotten that you're in a rear-wheel drive. There's this delicate balance between the flashy and the grounded, but it's a balance that Grid 2 pulls off extremely well.      It's only fitting that with such an empowering driving model, Grid 2 treats you as an ambassador to the sport rather than a no-name up-and-comer. You're the poster child of the newly formed World Series of Racing, an organization designed to bring together drivers from all corners of the globe. Your job is to win over these international stars and convince them to join the cause. You do this by traveling the world and competing against everything from muscle cars in Miami to hot hatches in Barcelona to luxury sedans in Dubai. You'll even find yourself driving in supercars on real-world circuits, whether it's the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway or the relatively new Algarve Circuit in Portugal. All the while you're earning new fans to bolster the WSR, a sort of currency that propels you from one event to the next.     Grid 2 features no shortage of spectacular locations, and every one of them looks gorgeous. From the golden sunset above the construction cranes of Dubai to the glittering lights of nighttime Paris, these environments feature an exceptional attention to detail. The varied selection of cars looks just as great, no matter if they're in pristine condition at the start of the race or shedding metalwork left and right via the game's frighteningly convincing damage system. The whole presentation is simply top-notch, right on down to the immersive soundscape of roaring engines and squealing tires. The frame rate occasionally drops during vicious collisions, but for the most part, Grid 2 is a smooth and technically impressive racing experience.         There's a lot more to Grid 2 than its impressive presentation. This is a robust package with a lengthy and exciting career mode. You're constantly being introduced to new driving disciplines and event types. There are standard offerings such as elimination and time attack, as well as more specialized events such as drifting contests and touge, an automotive ballet where two cars race through narrow mountain roads and any collisions lead to an immediate disqualification.       But the most fun can be found in an event type called live routes. Normally urban locales like Miami and Dubai are divided into six or so predefined tracks, each taking you on a tour through different areas of the city. What live routes do is generate a dynamic layout that stitches together sections from every single one of those six tracks. It's an event where you never know what's around the next bend, which keeps you on your toes as you maintain an exacting focus on each randomly selected turn.         The focus of Grid 2's career mode is very much about getting you on the road and having you experience one crazy race after the other. This is not a game that wants you to spend too much time in the garage. Instead of buying cars and upgrading engine parts, you're simply awarded a choice of vehicles after milestone events. As your garage expands, you develop a collection of grippy all-wheel drives like the Audi RS5, demanding track cars like the KTM X-Bow R, and all manner of other makes and models. With such a varied selection of cars and event types, there's a deeply satisfying sense of challenge in learning the nuances of each vehicle and deciding which one is best suited for a particular event. Rarely does the most powerful car win by default; Grid 2 demands a familiarity with your garage and is all the more rewarding for it.     Even with its forgiving handling, Grid 2 can get quite challenging--especially toward the latter stages of the career mode. There's no driving line to guide you through each corner, and full vehicle damage is enabled by default, meaning your car starts to pull and sputter if it has taken too many hits. As the game ramps up in difficulty, you may find yourself wishing for optional driving assists, which are sadly lacking here--your only option is to raise or lower the difficulty level. Fortunately, Grid 2's fleet of vehicles are such a blast to maneuver that you'll be more than up to the task. Add in the ability to rewind time after a nasty accident, and what you get is a game that challenges you but rarely leaves you frustrated.      As engrossing as Grid 2's career mode is, it's just as easy to get sucked into the multiplayer side of things. Besides giving you the opportunity to race all those same tracks and event types in a competitive online environment, Grid 2's multiplayer serves as a nice counterpart to the career mode by allowing you to get a little more hands-on with your collection of cars. Racing online earns you cash to buy new vehicles, which you can tune by upgrading the engine, drivetrain, and handling. And while you're keeping tabs on your garage, the game is keeping tabs on you by tracking your driving style and ensuring that you're matched up with drivers who race just as clean or dirty as you. The multiplayer is a terrific addition to an already excellent game, and the ability to play local split-screen is just icing on the cake.         Whether you're competing online or off, Grid 2 offers a fantastic blend of arcade and simulation racing. This is a game that wants you to experience the thrill of breakneck street racing, and gives you all the tools necessary to do just that. With terrific handling, gorgeous environments, and a broad selection of event types, Grid 2 slams on the gas and rarely slows down.    "
